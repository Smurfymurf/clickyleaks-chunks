In the future, after a Third World War has decimated much of the Earth's population, a new nation known as Libria rises up under the unquestioned leadership of Dupont (Angus MacFadyen). Believing human emotions and their expression were to blame for the failings of past societies, The Father has decreed that all citizens must take a daily dose of Prozia II, a drug which levels out the emotional landscape, and that all forms of creative expression are against the law; violating either regulation can be punished by death. John Preston (Christian Bale) is a Grammaton, an elite law enforcement officer who tracks down and punishes \"sense offenders.\" One day, Preston accidentally fails to take his Prozia II, and for the first time begins experiencing emotions himself. Preston becomes aware of an underground of rebels who refuse to take their medication and have embraced art and literature, and he finds himself becoming infatuated with one of their number, Mary O'Brian (Emily Watson). Equilibrium is the second feature-length directorial effort from Kurt Wimmer, whose screenwriting credits include The Thomas Crown Affair and Sphere.\n\nequilibrium,\"equilibrium clip\",\"equilibrium trailer\",\"equilibrium fight scene\",\"christian bale\",\"emily watson\",\"angus macfadyen\",\"kurt wimmer\",\"bottle videos\",\"sci-fi thrillers\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi dramas\",\"harvey weinstein\",\"bob weinstein\",\"andrew rona\",\"lucas foster\",\"sue baden-powell\",\"jan de bont\",\"ninon tantet\",\"freedom videos\",\"individualism videos\",\"life and death videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++259842,/m/01wy5m,/m/04nr37,/m/02l4pj", "title": "Equilibrium (3/12) Movie CLIP - Why Are You Alive?

He made numerous contributions to nuclear and molecular physics, spectroscopy (in particular, the Jahn--Teller and Renner--Teller effects) and surface physics. His extension of Enrico Fermi's theory of beta decay, in the form of the so-called Gamow--Teller transitions, provided an important stepping stone in its application, while the Jahn--Teller effect and the Brunauer--Emmett--Teller (BET) theory have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry. Teller also made contributions to Thomas--Fermi theory, the precursor of density functional theory, a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules. In 1953, along with Nicholas Metropolis and Marshall Rosenbluth, Teller co-authored a paper which is a standard starting point for the applications of the Monte Carlo method to statistical mechanics.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC:BA 3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Teller\n\nText to Speech powered by TTS-API.COM\n\nImages are Public Domain", "title": "All About - Edward Teller", "publishedDate": "2014-07-22T23:02:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "59ioz_yoc-w", "description": "This video shows you how to say or pronounce Liberality.\n\nHow accurate does it say Liberality?

The single-seat Hunter entered service as a maneuverable fighter aircraft, and later operated in fighter-bomber and reconnaissance roles in numerous conflicts. Two-seat variants remained in use for training and secondary roles with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy until the early 1990s. The Hunter was also widely exported, serving with 21 other air forces; 50 years after its original introduction it is still in active service, operating with the Lebanese Air Force.\n\nOn 7 September 1953, the modified first prototype broke the world air speed record, achieving 727.63 mph (1,171.01 km/h). Hunters were also used by two RAF display teams; the \"Black Arrows\", who on one occasion looped a record-breaking 22 examples in formation, and later the \"Blue Diamonds\", who flew 16 aircraft. Overall, 1,972 Hunters were produced by Hawker Siddeley and under licence. In British service, the aircraft was replaced by the English Electric Lightning, the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and the McDonnell Douglas Phantom.\n\nThe Hawker Sea Fury was a British fighter aircraft developed for the Royal Navy by Hawker during the Second World War. The last propeller-driven fighter to serve with the Royal Navy, it was also one of the fastest production single piston-engined aircraft ever built. Exported to a number of countries, it acquitted itself well in the Korean War even against the MiG-15 jet aircraft.", "title": "Hawker Hunter Miss Demeanour and Sea Fury - Dunsfold Park Surrey Wings and Wheels 2012 1080p HD", "publishedDate": "2012-08-27T13:01:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "59xzUHUjemM", "description": "", "title": "Jura de Bandera AGM 2010 LXX", "publishedDate": "2010-11-01T12:30:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "59yIrXr0thk", "description": "With hundreds of job losses, fee hikes and classroom privatisation plans across Queensland TAFES, it's time to teach Premier Campbell Newman and Education Minister John-Paul Langbroek a lesson.

There have been a couple of instances when I\u2019ve been told that I am billing for services when there isn\u2019t proper documentation. My employer thinks that since we\u2019re certified we should now know everything. Can you give me any advice? Christopher.  \n\nA: Well, Christopher, yes, since you\u2019re certified, you will be looked up to as a person that probably knows more than other people in the office. However, if somebody\u2026 you don\u2019t have to be certified to be a coder and you may have some people that have worked there for a long time and are very knowledgeable.  \n\nBut, going back to documentation, if there isn\u2019t proper documentation then you can\u2019t code it and you can\u2019t bill for it. So, if it\u2019s a supervisor that you can talk to and come back with facts, you need to have examples and scenarios then plead your case with them, let them know. Don\u2019t say, \u201cOh, you could get audited\u201d or \u201cThe Feds are going to come in,\u201d or Tammy was saying, \u201cI hope you like the color orange\u201d the other day in the auditing class. But, I would just try to plead my case and give good examples of what the proper documentation would look like. However, you\u2019re not talking to the physician, you\u2019re talking to your supervisor; you got to be very careful when you\u2019re talking to the physician.  \n\nAnd if without the documentation, you can show them, \u201cThis is how much we can bill out; this is your reimbursement for that. If we have this documentation, which is what I think that you do or you did, we want you to get paid for the services that you\u2019re providing, then we can bill this, and this is a reimbursement that you would receive for that. But we can\u2019t get this without this documentation, and again we want you to be reimbursed for the care that you\u2019re giving.\u201d And see if that helps, because when you talk money and let them see it in black and white, sometimes that helps.

Nine other survivors were rescued by Greek and Maltese ships, but all the rest appear to have perished,\" Flavio Di Giacomo, IOM's spokesman in Italy, told AFP on Monday. \n\nThe witnesses said that the boat left Damietta, Egypt, in early September with Syrians, Palestinians, Egyptians and Sudanese on board, according to IOM spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume. \n\nThey added that the boat sank Wednesday after a group of human traffickers rammed it with another boat as the asylum seekers refused to transfer to another vessel which they feared was too small. \n\nAfter the boat sank, both Palestinians spent a day in the water fighting for their lives, IOM said, citing the witnesses. One of them was in a lifejacket, while the other was holding on to a life buoy with other migrants who did not survive. The Palestinians said that among them was a young Egyptian boy who hoped to make money in Europe to pay for his father's heart operation. \n\n\"If this story, which police are investigating, is true, it would be the worst shipwreck in years... not an accident but a mass murder, perpetrated by criminals without scruples or any respect for human life,\" IOM said in a statement Monday.\n\nhttp://rt.com/news/187944-hundreds-migrants-killed-mediterranean/", "title": "Over 500 Migrants Feared Dead In Mediterranean Sea After Human Traffickers 'Sank the Boat'", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T18:14:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "5AEQdM4E8fg", "description": "Hit that LIKE button if you enjoyed and SUBSCRIBE for more!\n\nFOLLOW ME:\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/1la4vpt\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/1la4BNL  \n\nYour exclusive link to savings on Karmaloop and PLNDR! \nhttp://bit.ly/VL694U\nUse RepCode \"THETREND\" \n\nBusiness Inquiries: WeAreTheTrend@gmail.com\nWe-Are-The-Trend.com", "title": "Air Jordan 1 | Black/White | On Foot!", "publishedDate": "2014-11-09T20:55:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "5AElmBRROzM", "description": "Tonka limping before amputation surgery and learning to walk post surgery.His biopsy came back as Chondrosarcoma.", "title": "Tonka the Saint Bernard", "publishedDate": "2014-01-30T20:39:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "5AF5lzS88UA", "description": "", "title": "Carnaval Saint Tropez - La Fricass\u00e9e", "publishedDate": "2012-02-13T18:26:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "5AFSGhBu11A", "description": "It's been raining. #rain #plants #nature #droplets #raining #red #monocot #colour #plant #happy\n\n\nMore Videos at our site: http://flowersly.com/\n\n\nMusic 'Happy Birthday, Baby' by Harpoon ForeverbrAvailable on the Free Music Archive freemusicarchive.orgbrUnder CC BY license http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n\nTags:plant flower flora flowers gardening", "title": "79 Uses For Gardening", "publishedDate": "2014-09-12T19:43:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "5AFTyM6IRq4", "description": "La noche del 5 de Diciembre del 2013 a eso de las 2am me despert\u00f3 este extra\u00f1o ruido, es curioso que no se distinga exactamente si viene de la izquierda o derecha.

Hey hey my lovely Little Monsters. We're not sure if this is a real song leak from Mother Monster but a clip of her rumored new song \"Burqa\" has leaked online. We already know that \"Burqa\" is a confirmed track on her upcoming \"ARTPOP\" app/ album but is this snippet real deal? The low quality Soundcloud clip hears Gaga sing all about burqas (an Islamic outer garment) to a heavy electronic track. The lyrics in the futuristic song go, \"Disturb the unaware/ Put it on, conceal your hair/ Disturb the unaware/ Bitch I've been on the cover of Vanity Fair.\" So far these definitely sound like Gaga lyrics singing about hair and magazine covers. Here's more, \"Let's get it on, religious risky fashion/ Let's get it on, religious risky fashion/ Put it on, wear that Burqa all year long, all year long.\" Again, the religious references are very Gaga-esque as well as the fashion shout out. Here's the supposed chorus lyrics, \"Burqa, burqa, burqa let's get psychotic/ Burqa, burqa, burqa let's get erotic, robotic.\" Surely the Islamic community might have something to say about those controversial lyrics. This new leak comes just a few months after a supposed instrumental leak of the 'Burqa' song hit the web. We think this leak might be the actual song since we know her new single is coming August 19th and she's worked with DJ Zedd on the album and has said it will be \"experimental\" with a heavy electronic dance influence. Again, the clip is really low quality but does sound like Gaga. So is this her upcoming single? Rumor has it she's changed the lead single off the album more than three times! So we'll have to wait and see. Take a listen yourself, links below, and give us your expert opinion if this is a real ARTPOP track or not.

A lost soul grappling with a troubled past, Henry finds himself at a public school where an apathetic student body has created a frustrated, burned-out administration. In finding an emotional connection to the students but also to fellow teachers and a runaway teen, he finds that he's not alone in a life and death struggle to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world. Kaye has molded a contemporary vision of people who become increasingly distant from others while still feeling the need to connect. DETACHMENT features a stellar ensemble cast, including Academy Award(R) winner Marcia Gay Harden, Christina Hendricks, William Petersen, Bryan Cranston, Tim Blake Nelson, Lucy Liu, Blythe Danner, Academy Award(R) nominees James Caan, and newcomers Sami Gayle and Betty Kaye.\n\n\"Detachment\" \"Detachment movie\" \"Detachment HD\" \"Detachment trailer\" \"Tony Kaye\" \"Adrien Brody\" \"Marcia Gay Harden\" \"Christina Hendricks\" \"William Petersen\" \"Bryan Cranston\" \"Tim Blake Nelson\" \"Betty Kaye\" \"Sami Gayle \"Lucy Liu\" \"Blythe Danner\" \"James Caan\" \"american history x\" movieclips movie clips movieclipstrailers movieclipsDOTcom scene clip", "title": "Detachment #3 Movie CLIP - I Used to be Very Angry (2012) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-02-22T19:17:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ALpqe7wj0E", "description": "The Parent's Letter Project lets a parent whose child has been a patient at Children's National reach out to families who are about to undergo similar treatment by writing a letter of advice and support. http://www.AParentsLetter.org", "title": "Aortic Truncus 1 - Having a Baby With a Heart Defect | Children's National Medical Center", "publishedDate": "2012-06-05T20:24:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ALvnQGWJhw", "description": "", "title": "\u00c7elik'ten Veliaht'\u0131n sunucusu G\u00f6zde Kansu'ya tepki", "publishedDate": "2013-11-13T19:02:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "5AMOdWPEFFA", "description": "From the album - Fleet Foxes", "title": "Fleet Foxes -  Isles", "publishedDate": "2009-07-05T16:25:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "5AMicrS-0Fo", "description": "The Korean delicacy Sannakji known as 'wriggling octopus' enjoys assaulting its consumer when being eaten. The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "living octopus swimming in olive oil ready to be eaten in korea", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T22:02:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "5AMn-9pa0_E", "description": "Welcome to the Oki Islands, a few small islands off the coast of Shimane Prefecture on Japan's main island of Honshu.

Sometimes size actually does matter and in such cases, PolyTune Mini is the perfect solution as no other pedal tuner in the world will take up so little space, which means more room for other pedals.\n\nPolyTune Mini shows you the tuning state of all strings simultaneously by simply strumming your guitar, allowing you to get back to playing in a matter of seconds. PolyTune Mini is among the most precise tuners in the world, tuning with +/- 0.5 cent precision in chromatic mode and +/- 1 cent accuracy in polyphonic mode. Also, it automatically switches between chromatic and polyphonic modes depending on whether you strum all strings at once or pick each string individually.\n\nFurther, PolyTune Mini features Drop-D and Capo modes as well as True Bypass for zero tone coloration and a super-bright LED display.", "title": "PolyTune\u00ae Mini - Tuning Distilled", "publishedDate": "2012-01-13T15:07:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Af2SKGdYc4", "description": "(1970) Charisma Records", "title": "Devil's High Concern - RARE BIRD", "publishedDate": "2010-05-27T03:42:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Af6wVR05Sg", "description": "", "title": "Bone Marrow", "publishedDate": "2013-09-11T06:26:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "5AfNhIB4PIY", "description": "Class\u00e9 en 1979 au patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco, le Mont-Saint Michel est le 3\u00e8me site le plus visit\u00e9 de France avec 2,4 millions de touristes par an.

Everyone has probably heard of how amazing the original oxyelite pro was. But then of course it had to change due to DMAA. Is the new formula just as effective, yet safer to consume? Let's take a look at the bottle.\nSo here we see that this is a university studied super thermogenic. There is a warning label below that reads, oxyelite pro is pharmacist formulated and must be used with extreme caution. And only by healthy adults capable of handling its true power. It is mandatory that users get clearance from their physician before use. That last sentence makes it seem as though, if it were true, that this would strictly be a prescribed medication, none the less, sounds intense! Let's see what real users have been saying about this new formula, time for some social proof.\nReported pros\n1) Increases focus levels\n2) Great thermogenic\n3) Helps to burn fat\n4) Increased, clean energy\nReported cons\n1) Need to be certain to eat enough nutrition\n2) Not meant for long term use\n\nWell so far this is looking to be quite effective, let's take a look at the ratings. Here we see that bodybuilding.com has just 32 ratings for the new formula scoring 8.4. Supplementreviews.com has one lonely fan that gave it a ridiculous 10 out of 10. This totals 33 ratings scoring 8.45. This new formula still needs more social proof, but so far it's worth a try. Let's take a look at the active ingredients.\n\nBauhinia Purpurea L\n- According to SportsNutritionMarket.com, this ingredient increases T3 to T4 ratios, which increases fat-burn, energy, and mood. \n- The higher levels of thyroid activity increases the rate of metabolism by about 30 to 40%. \n- In addition, the underactive thyroid diminishes the metabolism rate. \n-  It also possesses activity good for keeping blood sugar under control.\nAegeline\n- This is a main alkaloid isolated from Aegle Marmelos Correa leaves, that causes a release of Histamine which acts to regulate the appetite.\n- Histamine is what will suppress your appetite to less controlling levels.\nNorcoclaurine HCl\n- Works as a stimulant for the extra kick of fat burn, endurance, and a dash of euphoria.\n- It's an effective beta-1 & beta-2 adrenergic agonist.  \n- Beta-1 is responsible for boosting the heart rate.\n- Beta-2 is responsible for boosting lipolysis, which in turn releases fatty acids from your fat cells.\n- This may result in more energy and less body fat.\nHemerocallis Fulva\n- Promotes Lipolysis by increasing the mobility of fat out of the cell and into the bloodstream to be used as a source of energy.   \n- It works as both an antioxidant and \"lipid peroxidator\", meaning that it's going to attack lipids/fats by literally stealing electrons from your fat cells, effectively putting them on the move and lining them up for use as energy.\nYohimbe\n- According to MensFitness.com, yohimbe is said to block specific receptors that actually inhibit fat loss. \n- A three-week study in 1991 observed 20 obese females on 1,000-calorie diets. \n- They were given 20 mg of yohimbe each day and lost three pounds more than the group receiving placebos. \n- Not a drastic weight loss, but enough to give experts hope that yohimbe can help with weight loss. \n- Other studies have found that yohimbe increases the amount of non-esterified fatty acids, a result of fat breaking down, still more research is needed.\nCaffeine\n- Unless you've lived on the moon for most of your life, you know what this is.\n- It will help to increase cognitive abilities, alertness, and might stimulate metabolism for additional aid in fat loss.\n- One shouldn't consume more than 500 mg in one day, a cup of coffee has roughly 100 mg and pre workout supplements or fat burners generally have 130 mg.\nFinal Verdict\nSo far so good when it comes to the new formula, more reviews need to be considered, but as of now the user can expect:\n- Additional fat loss\n- Elevated, clean energy\n- Enhanced focus\nHowever, draw backs to consider are:\n- It's very potent\n- Must be sure to nourish yourself daily\n- Not a long term supplement\nIf you'd like to know when the new oxyelite pro goes on special, visit rawmusclegain.com and sign up using our form.

It was serialized in the semi-monthly Japanese magazine Hana to Yume, published by Hakusensha, from 1998 to 2006. The series was also adapted into a 26-episode anime series, directed by Akitaro Daichi. The series tells the story of Tohru Honda, an orphan girl who, after meeting Yuki, Kyo, and Shigure Sohma, learns that twelve members of the Sohma family are possessed by the animals of the Chinese zodiac (\u5341\u4e8c\u652f J\u016bnishi?) and are cursed to turn into their animal forms when they are weak, stressed, or when they are embraced by anyone of the opposite sex that is not possessed by a zodiacal spirit. In the anime it is possible to transform through torso contact.\n\nThe word \"Fruits\" in the title is always plural; the spelling originates from the transcription of the English word \"fruit\" into Japanese, where because there is no \"tu\" sound, \"tsu\" is used instead. The title comes from the name of a popular game played in Japanese elementary schools, which is alluded to in the series.\n\nWhen high school student Tohru Honda's mother dies in a car crash on her way to work, she decides to live with her grandfather. Renovations on the house cause her to move out of her grandfather's house temporarily, and since she has nowhere else to go, Tohru begins living in a tent and supporting herself. That is, until she finds a home in the least likely of places, inhabited by her popular classmate Yuki Sohma and his cousins Shigure and Kyo. The Sohmas however, live with a curse. Twelve (not including Kyo, who is the cat) members of the family are possessed by spirits of the Chinese zodiac and turn into their zodiac animal when they are weak, under stress, or when hugged by someone of the opposite gender.\n\nWhen Tohru discovers the Sohmas' secret, she promises not to tell and is allowed to keep living with them. Although the Sohmas' curse is deeper and darker than Tohru realized, her presence and her acceptance of them soon becomes a large, positive influence on those possessed by the zodiac. She sets out to break the curse, and on the way, meets and discovers each of the Sohma's vengeful zodiac spirits. Each has a different personality, just like the animals in the Chinese zodiac. Tohru's existence changes the Sohma clan's lives forever.\n\nDirected by Akitaro Daichi, the twenty-six episode Fruits Basket anime series was animated and produced by Studio DEEN. It premiered on TV Tokyo on July 5, 2001, with the final episode airing on December 27, 2001. The series aired in France on France 4, in Spain on Buzz Channel, and in Vietnam on HTV3. FUNimation aired the series, in dubbed English, on their anime television channel as well as on Colours TV.\n\nThe series was released in Japan in nine individual DVD volumes by King Records, with each volume containing three episodes except for the first volume, which contained two. The first volume was released on September 29, 2001, with subsequent volumes released on a monthly basis until the final volume was released on May 22, 2002. A series box set was released on April 25, 2007, containing all twenty-six episodes, as well a message card from Natsuki Takaya, a 60-page deluxe booklet, and a bonus Fruits Basket CD soundtrack.\n\nThe series is licensed for Region 1 DVD release by FUNimation Entertainment, which released it in the form of four individual volumes containing 6-7 episodes and a complete series box set. On November 20, 2007, FUNimation re-released the series as part of their lower priced Viridian line, with the new release containing the complete series in a thin-packed box set. In the United Kingdom, FUNimation originally distributed the series through MVM Entertainment, but then changed distributors in November 2006 to Revelation Films. Revelation re-released the four individual volumes under their label. They also released the series box set on January 22, 2007. In Region 4, the series was released as a complete series box set by Madman Entertainment on October 15, 2003.\n\nThe 136 chapters of Fruits Basket were originally serialized in Japan by Hakusensha in Hana to Yume from July 1998 to November 2006. These were collected in 23 tank\u014dbon volumes, with the final volume published in Japan on March 19, 2007.", "title": "Fruits Basket Full Ending OST Soundtrack \u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u7948\u308a", "publishedDate": "2014-08-17T15:03:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "5AqRc4cXoi8", "description": "", "title": "Sail Tutorship via Lady Sevenstar Yachting", "publishedDate": "2013-02-24T15:03:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "5AqxCT_R49I", "description": "The official lyric video for THIRD DAY's song, \"Our Deliverer\", form the upcoming worship album, Lead Us Back.

Cohen Vein Care is committed to providing the highest quality of vein care to our patients through state-of-the-art diagnostics and a wide range of minimally-invasive vein therapies. Our office offers duplex ultrasound examinations for an accurate diagnosis of each patient's condition. Once a diagnosis is made, we customize treatment to each patient's specific needs, striving to provide the most effective treatment for the best possible results. Spider veins and varicose veins may also be effectively treated with injection treatments known as sclerotherapy. This treatment involves the injection of a \"sclerosing\" (hardening) solution into the affected vein that causes it to seal shut and eventually fade away.\nThe type and strength of the sclerosing agent used will depend on the size and location of the vein. Smaller spider veins generally respond better to a liquid sclerosant, while larger veins can be treated with a foamed solution that produces more coverage inside larger veins. Treatment of larger veins is typically done in combination with ultrasound, to ensure precision during the procedure. Sclerotherapy injections are administered in the office, using a very fine needle. Anesthesia is not needed and you may return to normal activities immediately following the procedure. Veins typically begin to fade from view within a few weeks. Most patients have multiple spider veins and benefit from a series of treatments.\n\nComplimentary Consultations-Vein Treatments- For patients concerned about varicose veins, other vein-related conditions, or who have cosmetic concerns, Cohen Vein Care offers complimentary consultations at no cost.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLRNgThVBz0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQKrOY0FPjw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d38CobI6xWo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z76mmql4XGQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy9xbUnHLdw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBrtozi8TNE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ubEl6GkEfI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ArCeDOUx0U\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATHnbMez61U\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjjQWD_isGY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEHMPlRXpVo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrTKCQ5EEic\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbJOcYPfGEU\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ufh3VZfhEM\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HggFKBd42RY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJyTvu_0Cho\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMfRIgKNTwM\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYo5uKodxMM\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGclXOAo3AM\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EQvWR9hRY  \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AznoA2a1f0E \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiBsFkAbBBQ \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD1zIZS04o8 \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk3dg8b-pEM\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ1u3u3uSJQ\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDDotuixmkY\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpJK11lVnvQ\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfH-DRNIP9Y\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7BIwQ3n-E\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7fDWm3SIlI\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRFbsXr9FnU\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ7Ge7jgPFQ \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sMh8kENN6I\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yokrkfWqiGU\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MJFl7j2TF0\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iil044qsJ-A \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F8Akr3im8U\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcEw_BGAfRA\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bmu5RgBFM4\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-6zWvmEHWM\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOTuz8oUw3I\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK2T-fTWgOg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgFtyx50ezw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-U_J3WLEa8", "title": "Catherine's Story-My Legs are Killing Me Paramus, Sore, Achy, Heavy, Hurting Legs, Sclerotherapy", "publishedDate": "2014-06-16T19:19:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ArCggh1qm0", "description": "", "title": "Jason Genova shows off his clear visible veins whilst being 16% striated", "publishedDate": "2014-03-03T22:53:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ArhMdbv6bk", "description": "Penn State Homecoming 2011 Postgame Show Blue Band with Alumni Blue Band", "title": "MOV083", "publishedDate": "2011-10-18T12:20:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ArnO-Q--M0", "description": "by Alyssa Spirato  State and federal food assistance programs are meant to help struggling families, but not everyone uses their EBT card the way it's intended.NewsChannel9 obtained records pointing to some swiping theirs for alcohol and even strip clubs. Most of the transactions are on the up-and up, but others caught our eye. Ronica Scott is one of the many Chattanooga residents who relies on government assistance. She says she's been on food stamps for the past 7 years.\"That's how my children eat from day to day. So I need it, I use mine the right way,\" says Scott.An advocacy group, Tennessee Watchdog, gave us state reports documenting every EBT transaction in June. One business on the list was the Chattanooga Convention Center. The report claims three transactions in June totaling about 30. Executive Director Mike Shuford says according to his records, they were a lobby ATM.\"We don't monitor our ATM machine. You know, you can walk up and we assume, we have cameras on it, but we don't look at what kind of card is being put into the machine,\" says Shuford.The Honest Pint restaurant and bar also made it onto the list. The records show a transaction for 2.50 on June 5th.It's a problem state officials are well aware of, and working to fix. There's one current snag. There's no way to track the cash once it's taken out. But thanks to a new law enacted in February, new regulations will be put in place.\"We can't prove because someone cashes their EBT Card at an ATM machine in a liquor store, that they are buying it for liquor. However, the new federal regulation is going to prohibit the use of EBT cards being cashed in liquor stores and adult entertainment,\" says Wanda Franklin, with Families First.As for Ronica Scott, she feels the responsibility lies in the hands of the user.\"It give the people that's using it the right way, it give us a bad name,\" says Scott.Now while the new regulation will prohibit ATM transactions in liquor stores and adult-oriented establishments, it won't put a stop to transactions at malls or hotels.Franklin says they hope to have the new regulation put in place very soon.", "title": "Waste Watch: Food Stamp Fraud", "publishedDate": "2012-10-05T16:48:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5AroJmsNN1Q", "description": "Varshavianka by Krakowski Ch\u00f3r Rewolucyjny in Polish\nProbably only existing on YouTube full version of it (including 2nd verse, usually skipped).\nAll credis to Krakowski Ch\u00f3r Rewolucyjny, I only did a translation of lyrics.\n\nVarshavianka is Polish revolutionary and patriotical (as workers movment did a great job for independece of Poland in late XIX and early XXth century) song, written by socialistic activist Wac\u0142aw \u015awi\u0119cicki due him imprisonment in Warsaw Citadel in 1879.

These changes are associated with the emergence of sex differences in the susceptibility of several mental illnesses, including eating and mood disorders and schizophrenia. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is an area that's often dysfunctional in mental illnesses. It has been shown that in adulthood, the number of neurons in the PFC is larger in males than in females and this sex difference is not present in pre-pubertal rats. This study looked at whether sex difference in cell proliferation during puberty underlies the ultimate difference in cell number. The rats received injections of cell birth\u2010date marker bromo\u2010deoxyuridine (BrdU) and were then sacrificed at different time points. Immunohistochemistry and lightmicroscopy were used to count BrdU\u2010labeled cells. We looked for differences in cell number between sexes, regions of the PFC, and stages of puberty. Preliminary data showed fewer new cells present later in puberty than there were in earlier stages. Additionally, a male\u2010biased sex difference was observed in the overall number of BrdU\u2010labeled cells in the prelimbic region. This data supports the hypothesis that new cells are added to the PFC during puberty and there appears to be a difference in the number of cells that are added and maintained in males and females. Further investigation into whether the new cells are neurons or glia will provide additional information about how the PFC develops during puberty.", "title": "Sexual Dimorphism in the Prefrontal Cortex During Puberty In Rats - UURAF 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-07-01T15:43:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "5AuTd78kGRE", "description": "Dr John AC Thanakumar\nSenior Consultant, Minimal Access, Bariatric and GI Surgery, Global Hospital.

Frankish, Lloyd Levin\nScreenwriter: W.P. Kinsella, Phil Alden Robinson\nFilm Description: \"If you build it, he will come.\" That's the ethereal message that inspires Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) to construct a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield. At first, \"he\" seems to be the ghost of disgraced ballplayer Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta), who materializes on the ballfield and plays a few games with the awestruck Ray. But as the weeks go by, Ray receives several other messages from a disembodied voice, one of which is \"Ease his pain.\" He realizes that his ballfield has been divinely ordained to give a second chance to people who have sacrificed certain valuable aspects of their lives.

So he wastes no time moving his wife Lisa (Abigail Spencer) and young daughter Heidi \n(Emily Alyn Lind) into this rambling new abode.

There are two phases of the cardiac cycle. In the diastole phase, the heart ventricles are relaxed and the heart fills with blood. In the systole phase, the ventricles contract and pump blood to the arteries. One cardiac cycle is completed when the heart fills with blood and the blood is pumped out of the heart. The events of the cardiac cycle described below trace the path of the blood as it enters the heart, is pumped to the lungs, travels back to the heart and is pumped out to the rest of the body. It is important to note that the events that occur in the first and second diastole phases actually happen at the same time. The same is also true for the events of the first and second systole phases.\n\nCardiac Cycle: 1st Diastole Phase\n\nDuring the diastole phase, the atria and ventricles are relaxed and the atrioventricular valves are open. De-oxygenated blood from the superior and inferior vena cavae flows into the right atrium. The open atrioventricular valves allow blood to pass through to the ventricles. The SA node contracts triggering the atria to contract. The right atrium empties its contents into the right ventricle. The tricuspid valve prevents the blood from flowing back into the right atrium.\n\nCardiac Cycle: 1st Systole Phase\n\nDuring the systole phase, the right ventricle receives impulses from the Purkinje fibers and contracts. The atrioventricular valves close and the semilunar valves open. The de-oxygenated blood is pumped into the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary valve prevents the blood from flowing back into the right ventricle.\n\nThe pulmonary artery carries the blood to the lungs. There the blood picks up oxygen and is returned to the left atrium of the heart by the pulmonary veins.\n\nCardiac Cycle: 2nd Diastole Phase\n\nIn the next diastole period, the semilunar valves close and the atrioventricular valves open. Blood from the pulmonary veins fills the left atrium. (Blood from the vena cava is also filling the right atrium.) The SA node contracts again triggering the atria to contract. The left atrium empties its contents into the left ventricle. The mitral valve prevents the oxygenated blood from flowing back into the left atrium.\nCardiac Cycle: 2nd Systole Phase\n\nDuring the following systole phase, the atrioventricular valves close and the semilunar valves open. The left ventricle receives impulses from the Purkinje fibers and contracts. Oxygenated blood is pumped into the aorta. The aortic valve prevents the oxygenated blood from flowing back into the left ventricle.\n\nThe aorta branches out to provide oxygenated blood to all parts of the body. The oxygen depleted blood is returned to the heart via the vena cavae.", "title": "Cardiac Cycle: Biology", "publishedDate": "2014-09-09T01:56:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "5B9QwIevvW0", "description": "Both packs get involved in some 'pushing & shoving' after a scrum in the Munster v Benetton Treviso rugby match in Round 17 of the RaboDirect PRO12 at Thomond Park, Limerick on Saturday 22nd March 2014.  \nFor more information on the RaboDirect PRO12 visit www.RaboDirectPRO12.com.\nYou can follow all of the latest images by visiting our official Instagram page http://instagram.com/rabodirectpro12.\nSubscribe to our channel @http://www.youtube.com/user/RaboDirectPRO12?sub_confirmation=1\n\nMunster\n\n15.

It is manufactured by Uralvagonzavod in Nizhnyi Tagil, Russia.\n\nThe T-90S entered service with the Russian Army in 1992. In February 2001, the Indian Army signed a contract for 310 T-90S tanks: 124 were completed in Russia and the rest are being delivered in \"knocked down\" form for final assembly in India.\n\nRepublic Day is the name of a holiday in several countries to commemorate the day when they became republics. In India, Republic Day honours the date on which the Constitution of India came into force--on 26 January 1950--replacing the Government of India Act (1935) as the governing document of India.  It is one of three national holidays in India. The new constitution, as drafted and approved by the Constituent Assembly of India, was mandated to take effect on 26 January 1950--and India became a republic. While India's Independence Day celebrates its freedom from British Rule, Republic Day celebrates the coming into force of its constitution. The main Republic Day celebration is held in the national capital, New Delhi, at the Rajpath before the President of India. Celebrations are also held with varying degrees of formality in state capitals, where the governor of the state unfurls the National Flag of India.\n\nIndia gained its independence on 15 August 1947, after which the process of preparing a constitution was started. The Constitution was passed on 26 November 1949 in the Constituent Assembly. It was adopted on 26 January 1950 with a democratic government system, when the country became a republic in true sense. 26 January was selected, because it was this day in 1930 when the Declaration of Indian Independence was passed.\n\nTo mark this occasion, a grand parade is held near Rajpath in New Delhi, the capital of India, beginning from Raisina Hill near the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace), along the Rajpath, past India Gate and on to the historic Red Fort in the old quarter of the city. Different infantry, cavalry and mechanized regiments compose the Indian Army, the Indian Marines and the Indian Air Force's march in formation, who are decked in all their finery and official decorations.\n\nThe President of India, who is also the Commander in Chief of the Indian Armed Forces, relishes the salute. The Chief Guest of the parade is the Head of State or Head of Government of another nation. The parade also includes many traditional dance troupes, to symbolize the cultural heritage of India. It traditionally ends with a colourful flypast by Indian Air Force jets in a tiranga formation. Similar parades are held in the capitals of all the states of India, where the governors of respective states take the salute. The official conclusion of Republic Day festivities is much later on 29 January, three days after the Republic Day, which is called 'Beating Retreat'.\n\nSource: http://www.army-technology.com/projects/t90/ & Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions.[2] Metropolitan areas, include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.\nA metropolitan area combines an urban agglomeration (the contiguous, built-up area) with zones not necessarily urban in character, but closely bound to the center by employment or other commerce. These outlying zones are sometimes known as a commuter belt, and may extend well beyond the urban zone, to other political entities. For example, El Monte, California is considered part of the Los Angeles' metro area in the United States.\nIn practice, the parameters of metropolitan areas, in both official and unofficial usage, are not consistent. Sometimes they are little different from an urban area, and in other cases they cover broad regions that have little relation to a single urban settlement; comparative statistics for metropolitan area should take this into account. Population figures given for one metro area can vary by millions.\nThere has been no significant change in the basic concept of metropolitan areas since its adoption in 1950,[4] although significant changes in geographic distributions have occurred since then, and more are expected.[5] Because of the fluidity of the term \"metropolitan statistical area,\" the term used colloquially is more often \"metro service area,\" \"metro area,\" or \"MSA\" taken to include not only a city, but also surrounding suburban, exurban and sometimes rural areas, all which it is presumed to influence.\nA polycentric metropolitan area is one not connected by continuous development or conurbation, which requires urban contiguity. In defining a metropolitan area, it is sufficient that a city or cities form a nucleus that other areas have a high degree of integration with.\nSource-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area", "title": "An Evening at a Metropolitan.", "publishedDate": "2013-11-20T22:42:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "5BQmd7IxcEE", "description": "Matisyahu discuses the journey to Israel where he begins the recording of \"Spark Seeker\".

It may refer to only the mansion (the 340-room main building) that has the President's official residence and offices; it may also refer to the entire 130 hectare (320 acre) President Estate that includes huge gardens (Mughal Gardens), residences of bodyguards and staff, other offices, stables and open spaces. The Rashtrapati Bhavan is a large and vast mansion with four floors and has 340 rooms. It is built on a floor area of 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2). It faces east. A straight east-west road, Rajpath (called King's Way or Kingsway by the British), starts from the huge square, Vijay Chowk, in front of Rashtrapati Bhavan and ends at India Gate on the western end of the road. North Avenue and South Avenue are two approach roads north and south of the estate in perfect symmetry. The east-west road (Rajpath) out of the Rashtrapati Bhawan is flanked by the two huge Central Secretariat buildings (North and South Blocks) that house various ministries of the Government of India. The Parliament House is located at eastern end of North Block.\n\nThe plan of the building is designed around a massive square with multiple courtyards and open inner areas within. The plan called for two wings; one for the Viceroy and residents and another for guests. The residence wing is a separate four-storey house in itself, with its own court areas within. This wing was so large that the first Indian governor-general, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, opted to live the smaller guest wing, a tradition that has since been followed by subsequent presidents. The original residence wing is now used primarily for state receptions and as a guest wing for visiting heads of state.\n\nThe centre of the main wing of the building, underneath the main dome, is the Durbar Hall, which was known as the Throne Room during British rule when it had thrones for the Viceroy and Vicereine (his wife). The interior of this room and almost all the rooms of the palace are bare, relying on stonework and shapes to show austerity rather than intricate decoration. In the hall, the columns are made in Delhi order which combines vertical lines with the motif of a bell. The vertical lines from the column were also used in the frieze around the room, which could not have been done with one of the traditional Greek orders of columns. The hall has a 2-ton chandelier which hangs from a 33-metre height. The two state drawing rooms, the state supper room and the state library are each on the four corners of the hall. \n\nThere are also other rooms such as many loggias (galleries with open air on one side) which face out into the courtyards, a large dining hall with an extremely long table, sitting rooms, billiards rooms, and a large ball room, and staircases. Water features are also through the palace, such as near the Viceroy's stairs, which has eight marble lion statues spilling water into six basins. These lions were symbolic of the heraldry of Great Britain. There is also an open area in one room to the sky, which lets in much of the natural light.\n \nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

It is a common mid- through late-summer feeder on milkweeds and dogbane. Like most species in this family, it has chemical defenses it acquires from its host plants, in this case, cardiac glycosides (Weller et al., 1999). These are retained in adults and deter bats, and presumably other predators, from feeding on them (Hristov and Conner 2005). Only very high cardiac glycoside concentrations deterred bats, however (Hristov and Conner 2005). Adults indicate their unpalatability with clicks from their tymbal organs (Simmons and Conner 1996).\n\nThis moth frequently uses Milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) and sometimes dogbane (Apocynum spp.) as larval host plants. Larvae often feed on older milkweed shoots, and seldom share shoots with Monarchs Danaus plexippus, which prefer younger ones (Wagner, 2005).\n\nDogbanes and Milkweeds produce a sticky latex that can impede larval feeding. Early instars avoid the veins by skeletonizing the leaves. Older larvae sever the veins that supply the latex, which reduces laxtex flow to the area they feed on (Dussourd and Denno, 1991).\n\\\nsharing what i seen today with you.\nif you have some time\nplease leave a comment below. \nand Please Subscribe to my channel \n \nand thank you very much for watching my videos..\n\npictures of Griffith IN  here \nhttp://christopherphoto.blogspot.com\n\nVisit Griffith Indiana's Nature on facebook \nhttp://www.facebook.com/GriffithIndianasNaturePhotos\n\njoin me on Google+ \nhttp://plus.google.com/112815794394767726853\n\nJoin me on Twitter\nhttp://twitter.com/griffithindiana", "title": "Baby Tussock Caterpillers", "publishedDate": "2013-08-29T09:52:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "5BlGIUR-pzY", "description": "Dog Training Video - Expert dog trainer Eric Letendre gives a full and detailed explanation of the American Kennel Club's Canine Good Citizen test.

For example, it can be used to make props a size suitable for characters to interact with. The throne in the last scene is about half the size it appears in the video, so I scaled it so it would be big enough for the Pyro to lounge in. Also, cosmetic items can be re-sized to fit other classes and models.

I saw it on MusicRadar, and as soon as I saw it I knew I had to get one.\nIt's steel strung, Agathis bodied. I paid about \u00a3140 for it, and honestly for the money, I don't think there's anything you can buy better new.\nIt came set up nicely, I haven't had it set up, so it's still got the factory action and intonation, and plays really nice and sounds fine to me, and I'm playing on Bronze Phosphor strings, which in the past I've found harder to play on than say, Regular Slinky steels.\nThe sound is great (though not conveyed perfectly in this video, when I get a decent mic, I'll upload a better quality demo of the tone), and the size (it\u2019s a parlour guitar) means it's really compact and comfortable, whereas I can find some acoustics too deep, and therefore uncomfortable to wrap myself around.\nThe quality really amazed me when I got it. I expected, that buying a guitar for \u00a3140 from a brand as high end and reputable as Gretsch, the quality would severely suffer, but I don\u2019t think it has. The binding is painted, but it seems to be fairly hardwearing, and it\u2019s not sloppily done, like I\u2019ve seen on some cheaper guitars. The bridge looks to be of some good quality hardwood, the frets are nicely finished, and it comes with some really cool small-keyed tuners.

The term \"domestic dog\" is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties. The dog was the first domesticated animal [4] and has been the most widely kept working, hunting, and pet animal in human history. The word \"dog\" may also mean the male of a canine species,[5] as opposed to the word \"bitch\" for the female of the species.\nMtDNA evidence shows an evolutionary split between the modern dog's lineage and the modern wolf's lineage around 100,000 years ago but, as of 2013, the oldest fossil specimens genetically linked to the modern dog's lineage date to approximately 33,000-36,000 years ago.[4][6] Dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This impact on human society has given them the nickname \"Man's Best Friend\" in the Western world. In some cultures, dogs are also a source of meat.[7][8] In 2001, there were estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.[9]\nMost breeds of dogs are at most a few hundred years old, having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for specific functional roles. Through this selective breeding, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.[10] For example, height measured to the withers ranges from 15.2 centimetres (6.0 in) in the Chihuahua to about 76 cm (30 in) in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called \"blue\") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark (\"red\" or \"chocolate\") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.[11] It is common for most breeds to shed this coat.\n\"Dog\" is the common use term that refers to members of the subspecies Canis lupus familiaris (canis, \"dog\"; lupus, \"wolf\"; familiaris, \"of a household\" or \"domestic\"). The term can also be used to refer to a wider range of related species, such as the members of the genus Canis, or \"true dogs\", including the wolf, coyote, and jackals, or it can refer to the members of the tribe Canini, which would also include the African wild dog, or it can be used to refer to any member of the family Canidae, which would also include the foxes, bush dog, raccoon dog, and others.[12] Some members of the family have \"dog\" in their common names, such as the raccoon dog and the African wild dog. A few animals have \"dog\" in their common names but are not canids, such as the prairie dog.\nThe English word \"dog\" comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a \"powerful dog breed\".[13] The term may possibly derive from Proto-Germanic *dukk\u014dn, represented in Old English finger-docce (\"finger-muscle\").[14] The word also shows the familiar petname diminutive -ga also seen in frogga \"frog\", picga \"pig\", stagga \"stag\", wicga \"beetle, worm\", among others.[15] Due to the archaic structure of the word, the term dog may ultimately derive from the earliest layer of Proto-Indo-European vocabulary, reflecting the role of the dog as the earliest domesticated animal.[16]\nIn 14th-century England, \"hound\" (from Old English: hund) was the general word for all domestic canines, and \"dog\" referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff. It is believed this \"dog\" type of \"hound\" was so common, it eventually became the prototype of the category \"hound\".[17] By the 16th century, dog had become the general word, and hound had begun to refer only to types used for hunting.[18] Hound, cognate to German Hund, Dutch hond, common Scandinavian hund, and Icelandic hundur, is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European *kwon- \"dog\", found in Sanskrit kukuur (\u0915\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0915\u0941\u0930),[19] Welsh ci (plural cwn), Latin canis, Greek k\u00fd\u014dn, and Lithuanian \u0161u\u00f5.[20]\nIn breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a dog, while a female is called a bitch (Middle English bicche, from Old English bicce, ultimately from Old Norse bikkja). A group of offspring is a litter. The father of a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the dam. Offspring are, in general, called pups or puppies, from French poup\u00e9e, until they are about a year old. The process of birth is whelping, from the Old English word hwelp (cf. German Welpe, Dutch welp, Swedish valpa, Icelandic hvelpur).[21] The term \"whelp\" can also be used to refer to the young of any canid, or as a (somewhat archaic) alternative to \"puppy\".", "title": "\" Seeing is believing ,but smelling makes it for sure \" by Vulcain the black dog", "publishedDate": "2013-05-20T21:29:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "5COAxSzT-Rk", "description": "A l'occasion de la nouvelle saison des Ch'tis sur W9, les voila poser leurs valises \u00e0 Marbella pour r\u00e9ussir dans la Jet- Set\n\nPour le d\u00e9but de la saison, Adixia nous livre une interview exclusive ------------------------------\n\nPour ne rien manquer de nos vid\u00e9os, abonnez-vous :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/PurePeopleTV?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPour voir toujours plus de vid\u00e9os de vos peoples pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/PurePeopleTV/videos\n\nL'actualit\u00e9 100% people en continu !

They come from ports like Juneau AK and Bellingham WA, and many end up in Sausalito. For their 40 feet they are a sturdy boat, usually made of aluminum, powered by two inboard-outboard diesels, and capable of carrying several tons of fish. A gill net is played out over rollers at the bow and the boat anchors for several hours or over night, and then pulls the net back in, shaking the fish out of the net and into the hold. It's then only a few minutes back to the Fish Dock where the herring are sucked out of the boat with a giant vacuum pump.\n\nThe Pacific Herring, Clupea harengus, is found from Baja off Mexico to the Bering Sea off Alaska. They come into bays and estuaries to lay their eggs. For fish caught here only the herring roe has commercial value, mostly in Japan. The harvest of herring, if it is to be sustainable year after year, needs to be a balance between allowing some fish to lay and fertilize eggs to catching adults and selling the roe.\n\nThe California Fish and Game Department sets a limit on the total number of tons that can be caught.

Four main types are currently in clinical use:\n\n    An inactivated vaccine consists of virus or bacteria that are grown in culture and then killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde. Although the virus or bacteria particles are destroyed and cannot replicate, the virus capsid proteins or bacterial wall are intact enough to be recognized and remembered by the immune system and evoke a response. When manufactured correctly, the vaccine is not infectious, but improper inactivation can result in intact and infectious particles. Since the properly produced vaccine does not reproduce, booster shots are required periodically to reinforce the immune response.\n    In an attenuated vaccine, live virus or bacteria with very low virulence are administered. They will replicate, but locally or very slowly. Since they do reproduce and continue to present antigen to the immune system beyond the initial vaccination, boosters may be required less often. These vaccines may be produced by passaging, for example, adapting a virus into different host cell cultures, such as in animals, or at suboptimal temperatures, allowing selection of less virulent strains, or by mutagenesis or targeted deletions in genes required for virulence. There is a small risk of reversion to virulence, which is smaller in vaccines with deletions. Attenuated vaccines also cannot be used by immunocompromised individuals. Reversions of virulence were described for a few attenuated viruses of chickens (infectious bursal disease virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus [3], avian metapneumovirus [4])[21]\n    Virus-like particle vaccines consist of viral protein(s) derived from the structural proteins of a virus. These proteins can self-assemble into particles that resemble the virus from which they were derived but lack viral nucleic acid, meaning that they are not infectious. Because of their highly repetitive, multivalent structure, virus-like particles are typically more immunogenic than subunit vaccines (described below). The human papillomavirus and Hepatitis B virus vaccines are two virus-like particle-based vaccines currently in clinical use.\n    A subunit vaccine presents an antigen to the immune system without introducing viral particles, whole or otherwise. One method of production involves isolation of a specific protein from a virus or bacterium (such as a bacterial toxin) and administering this by itself. A weakness of this technique is that isolated proteins may have a different three-dimensional structure than the protein in its normal context, and will induce antibodies that may not recognize the infectious organism. In addition, subunit vaccines often elicit weaker antibody responses than the other classes of vaccines.\n\nA number of other vaccine strategies are under experimental investigation. These include DNA vaccination and recombinant viral vectors. Source of the article published in description is Wikipedia. I am sharing their material.

This passages tells you how to produce iron ore concentrate and the limonite beneficiation equipments.\n\n Phosphorus is a deleterious contaminant because it makes steel brittle, even at concentrations of as little as 0.6%. Phosphorus cannot be easily removed by fluxing or smelting, and so iron ores must generally be low in phosphorus to begin with. The iron pillar of India which does not rust is protected by a phosphoricposition. Phosphoric acid is used as a rust converter because phosphoric iron is less susceptible to oxidation.\n\n The major effect of silicon is to promote the formation of grey iron. Grey iron is less brittle and easier to finish than white iron. It is preferred for casting purposes for this reason. Turner (, pp.\u00a0192--197) reported that silicon also reduces shrinkage and the formation of blowholes, lowering the number of bad castings.\n\n Metallic iron is virtually unknown on the surface of the Earth except as iron-nickel alloys from meteorites and very rare forms of deep mantle xenoliths. Although iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust,prising about 5%, the vast majority is bound in silicate or more rarely carbonate minerals. The thermodynamic barriers to separating pure iron from these minerals are formidable and energy intensive, therefore all sources of iron used by human industry exploitparatively rarer iron oxide minerals, pr", "title": "Iron-process upgrade iron ore processing", "publishedDate": "2012-09-30T17:50:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "5CiQ8bKU4bw", "description": "Troika dance from Russia", "title": "Troika - Russia - Folkl.

In other words, maximum sex-appeal in minimum time. What's not to like?\n\n\nStep 1: Choose eyeliner\nChoose an eyeliner that complements your eye shadow and mascara.\n\nStep 2: Test line\nTest the width of the line by drawing a little on the back of your hand. If the line is too wide, sharpen the pencil. If it's too thin, rub it against a tissue to make it more blunt.\n\nTip\nIf your eyeliner pencil tip is dry it may pull at delicate eye tissue\u2014run it back and forth on your hand several times to warm it, and it will glide on smoothly.\n\nStep 3: Rest elbow\nRest your elbow on a flat surface. This will keep your application steady and controlled.\n\nStep 4: Draw upper lash line\nDraw your eyeliner along your upper lash line, as close to your lashes as possible, beginning at the inner corner of your eye. Don't stretch your skin too much, it can make the eyeliner messy and uneven when you release it.\n\nTip\nJust like a normal pencil, the more pressure you apply, the thicker the line will be.\n\nStep 5: Draw lower lash line\nDraw a thin line in same direction on your lower lash line, but this time start in the middle of the lash line.\n\nTip\nFor a classic look, you don't need to line the inner part of the lower lash line, but if you are going for the rocker chick look, then, by all means, lather it on.\n\nStep 6: Repeat on other eye\nRepeat on your other eye, drawing a line on your upper and then lower lid to match your first eye.

The entire lecture can be found in the Tao of Philosophy audio collection, titled \"Myth of Myself\". I'm not sure where or when the lecture was given but more on Alan Watts (and audio) can be found at www.alanwatts.com. This animation was originally created by Matt Parker and Trey Stone's studio but I believe someone (who may or may not be associated with the studio) has altered and extended the original clip to this version. Enjoy!\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\nAlan Wilson Watts (6 January 1915 -- 16 November 1973) was a British philosopher, writer, and speaker, best known as an interpreter and popularizer of Eastern philosophy for a Western audience. Born in Chislehurst, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began Zen training in New York. Pursuing a career, he attended Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, where he received a master's degree in theology. Watts became an Episcopal priest but left the ministry in 1950 and moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies.\n\nLiving on the West Coast, Watts gained a large following in the San Francisco Bay Area while working as a volunteer programmer at KPFA, a Pacifica Radio station in Berkeley. Watts wrote more than 25 books and articles on subjects important to Eastern and Western religion, introducing the then-burgeoning youth culture to The Way of Zen (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism. In Psychotherapy East and West (1961), Watts proposed that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of psychotherapy and not just a religion. Like Aldous Huxley before him, he explored human consciousness in the essay, \"The New Alchemy\" (1958), and in the book, The Joyous Cosmology (1962).\n\nTowards the end of his life, he divided his time between a houseboat in Sausalito and a cabin on Mount Tamalpais. His legacy has been kept alive by his son, Mark Watts, and by many of his recorded talks and lectures that have found new life on the Internet. Critic Erik Davis notes the freshness, longevity, and continuing relevance of Watts's work today, observing that his \"writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanizing lucidity.\"", "title": "Alan Watts - The Myth of Myself (\"Appling\")", "publishedDate": "2011-10-07T21:02:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "5CrufNJ4A_Q", "description": "Hardball Movie Clip - watch all clips http://j.mp/KmcWso\nclick to subscribe http://j.mp/sNDUs5\n\nConor (Keanu Reeves) recounts G-Baby's game winning hit at his memorial service.\n\nTM & \u00a9 Paramount (2012)\nCast: A.

When she posted about her plans to buy a gun and move to Florida, police closed in, local media reported. \n\nPretending to be a John, a police police officer contacted Tichleman and arranged a July 4th \"date\" at an upscale country club where she was arrested. \n\nIn an interview police said Tichleman boasted she had more than 200 clients who paid upwards of $1,000 for her services. \n\nPolice are also looking into another death in which the victim died in similar circumstances.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

It is a specially formulated proprietary gel intended for individuals with excessive sweating. Hydrosal Professional contains 15% aluminum chloride hexahydrate, which is proven to be more effective than other aluminum salts typically used in regular antiperspirants.\n\nHydrosal Professional has a low risk of irritation due to its proprietary gel base. Studies have demonstrated that the gel vehicle is better tolerated than commonly used alcohol solution products for excessive sweating, resulting in less irritation 1. Hydrosal Professional not only helps to reduce perspiration, but also reduces odors 2, especially from excessive underarm sweating.\n\nHydrosal Professional is easy to use. Wash and dry the area to be treated, apply a pea-sized quantity of Hydrosal Professional and spread evenly.\n\nhttp://www.hydrosalpro.com/\n\nHyperhidrosis is a medical condition in which a person sweats excessively and unpredictably. People with hyperhidrosis may sweat even when the temperature is cool or when they are at rest according to \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004518/\nCauses, incidence, and risk factors\n\nSweating helps the body stay cool. In most cases, it is perfectly natural. People sweat more in warm temperatures, when they exercise, or in response to situations that make them nervous, angry, embarrassed, or afraid.\n\nHowever, excessive sweating occurs without such triggers. Those with hyperhidrosis appear to have overactive sweat glands. The uncontrollable sweating can lead to significant discomfort, both physical and emotional.\n\nWhen excessive sweating affects the hands, feet, and armpits, it's called primary or focal hyperhidrosis. Primary hyperhidrosis affects 2 - 3% of the population, yet less than 40% of patients with this condition seek medical advice. In the majority of primary hyperhidrosis cases, no cause can be found. It seems to run in families.\n\nIf the sweating occurs as a result of another medical condition, it is called secondary hyperhidrosis. The sweating may be all over the body, or it may be in one area. Conditions that cause second hyperhidrosis include:\n\n    Acromegaly\n\n    Anxiety conditions\n\n    Cancer\n\n    Carcinoid syndrome\n\n    Certain medications and substances of abuse\n\n    Glucose control disorders\n\n    Heart disease\n\n    Hyperthyroidism\n\n    Lung disease\n\n    Menopause\n\n    Parkinson's disease\n\n    Pheochromocytoma\n\n    Spinal cord injury\n\n    Stroke\n\n    Tuberculosis or other infections\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe primary symptom of hyperhidrosis is wetness.\nSigns and tests\n\nVisible signs of sweating may be noted during a doctor's visit. A number of tests may also be used to diagnose excessive sweating. Tests include:\n\nTests include:\n\n    Starch-iodine test. An iodine solution is applied to the sweaty area. After it dries, starch is sprinkled on the area. The starch-iodine combination turns a dark blue color wherever there is excess sweat.\n\n    Paper test. Special paper is placed on the affected area to absorb the sweat, and then weighed. The heavier it weights, the more sweat has accumulated.\n\nYou may be also be asked details about your sweating, such as:\n\n    Location\n\n        Does it occur your face, palms, or armpits, or all over the body?\n\n    Time pattern\n\n        Does it occur at night?\n\n        Did it begin suddenly?\n\n    Triggers\n\n        Does the sweating occur when you are reminded of something that upset you (such as traumatic event)?\n\n    What other symptoms do you have, for example:\n\n        Weight loss\n\n        Pounding heartbeat\n\n        Cold or clammy hands\n\n        Fever\n\n        Lack of appetite\n\nTreatment\n\nTreatments may include:\n\n    Antiperspirants. Excessive sweating may be controlled with strong anti-perspirants, which plug the sweat ducts. Products containing 10% to 20% aluminum chloride hexahydrate are the first line of treatment for underarm sweating. Some patients may be be prescribed a product containing a higher dose of aluminum chloride, which is applied nightly onto the affected areas. Antiperspirants can cause skin irritation, and large doses of aluminum chloride can damage clothing. Note: Deodorants do not prevent sweating, but are helpful in reducing body odor.", "title": "Treat Hyperhidrosis to Stop Excessive Sweating", "publishedDate": "2012-06-10T21:19:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "5CtT6DSTsRk", "description": "Moussaka cooked in Tupperware Stainless Steel Chef Series", "title": "Moussaka", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T01:19:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "5CtrGuTDiw0", "description": "Here's a fast & Easy way of removing the egg yolk from the egg :)\n\nPlease visit our website: http://bushcraftbartons.com/\nPlease Shop & Support us through our Amazon Store: http://bushcraftbartons.com/outdoor-store", "title": "FASTEST EGG YOLK REMOVAL EVER", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T22:05:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "5CuJjSk4U38", "description": "Stamping dies are the tools that shape and cut sheet metal parts. They are commonly developed using computer-aided design (CAD) software and analytical programs to create and prove-out highly accurate, unambiguous designs. These designs are then translated into stamping dies by skilled craftsmen, known as diemakers. Once these stamping dies are mounted into presses, sheet metal is fed to them to produce parts.\n\nPart of the Fundamental Manufacturing Processes Video Series, this program will help you better understand how stamping dies operate. You will explore sheet metal deformation and formability, segments on dies and die functions, die lubrication, and stamping analysis.\n\nThe dies and die functions segment looks at cutting die operations and forming die operations. The cutting die operations include shearing, blanking, punching, and trimming. The forming die operations include drawing, bending, flanging, and hemming. Single- and multiple-station dies are also examined, and include compound dies, combination dies, progressive dies, and transfer dies.\n\nThe die lubrication segment details the various types of lubricants used in stamping operations, as well as the common application methods, such as manual application, drip, roller, spraying, and flooding.\n\nThe stamping analysis segment focuses on the use of computer software programs to create stamping designs that can be manufactured with certainty, while minimizing the lengthy process of die making. The use of circle grid analysis (CGA) to fine tune these die designs is also highlighted.\n\nFor more information and to purchase, visit http://www.sme.org/fmp.\n\nservice@sme.org  |  800.733.4763  |  http://www.sme.org/store", "title": "Sheet Metal Stamping Dies & Processes", "publishedDate": "2014-06-19T20:36:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "5CuWJyK6tWA", "description": "a good driving song with some cool night pictures of cities (including a few of my hometown of Seattle, WA) The artists are Pink Bomb", "title": "Pink Bomb feat.

The Danish architect and professor Jan Gehl has studied human behavior in cities through 40 years. He has documented how modern cities repel human interaction, and argues that we can build cities in a way, which takes human needs for inclusion and intimacy into account.

Monoxides react with water to give corresponding hydroxides with the formula M OHtwice. The conductivities of alkaline earth metal halides decrease from Beryllium to Barium in molten state, but increase in aqueous solution. 1 Except Beryllium halides, all the other group IIA metal halide are ionic in nature.\nAnomalous property of Beryllium:Beryllium differs from the other alkaline earth metals because of its small size and high electro negativity.  Beryllium differs from the other elements in the following aspects:1 Beryllium compounds are predominantly covalent due to its high polarizing power and its salts are readily hydrolysed.2 Beryllium is not easily affected by dry air and does not decompose water at ordinary temperature.3 Beryllium is an amphoteric metal. It disolves in alkali solutions forming beryllates.4 BeSO4 is soluble in water where as the sulphates of Calcium, Strontium and Barium are not soluble.5 Beryllium and its salts do not respond to flame test while calcium, Strontium and Barium give Characteristic flame colours. 6 Beryllium forms many complexes while the heavier elements do not show a great tendency to form complexes.7 Beryllium has a maximum covalency of 4 while other can have a maximum covalence of 6.es Cal, SrO and Peroxides CaO2, SrO2\n\n7 Active Technology Solutions Pvt.Ltd. is an educational 3D digital content provider for\nK-12.

It is physically impossible for me to make or eat more soup. I still have soup in the refrigerator. Growing up on the standard American diet, I did not eat a lot of soup. When I did, they were not fresh healthy soups like these. They were sodium rich canned soups. To our detriment, we do not eat in the fashion anymore. People want to grab a burger, or sandwich, or a bag of something. How can I turn this wholesome meal into something that I would want to eat and that other people want to eat too.\n\nA slider! Sliders peeked in popularity a few years ago, but they are still a fun excuse to eat a burger. Veggie burgers are so easy to make and so diverse in texture, flavor, and style that I never get tired of them. Instead of blending my split peas down into a boring texture-less soup, I am going to mash it into a burger.\n\nSplit Pea Slider Recipe\n\nIngredients:\n\n1/2 cup split peas\n2 cups water\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon onion powder\n1/2 cup oatmeal\n4 whole wheat buns\nketchup, mustard, and other toppings\n\nDirections:\n\nBring the split peas and water to a simmer in a large pot. \n\nCook the peas for 30 minutes. They should be mushy but not completely falling apart.\n\nDrain the water from the peas and add them to a bowl.\n\nSeason the peas with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and oatmeal.\n\nMash and mix the peas with a fork.\n\nScoop an ice cream scoops worth of the green mixture onto a whole wheat bun.\n\nTop with ketchup, mustard, and whatever you prefer of your burger. Enjoy.\n\nAbout The Southern Queen of Vegan Cuisine Project: Inspired by the Julie and Julia Project, the Southern Queen of Vegan Cuisine will take on the Paula Deen Southern Cooking Bible.

It's a very common skin disorder that can be treated with the advanced lasers at American Medical Aesthetics. The group of people most affected by this skin disorder is young women with darker skin tones. It is also extremely common in pregnant women and women who are taking contraceptive pills or hormone replacement therapy. The risk is also higher for people who have been over-exposed to sunlight, and those who don't wear proper sun block. Melasma first appears like sun spots or sun damaged skin, and later develops into a more extensive \"mask-like\" coverage of the skin. Melasma can be described as a brown toned discoloration found most commonly on the cheeks, nose, lips and forehead.

One feature that we loved about A Frame Cardinal Birdhouse is that it has drain holes in the bottom and a clean-out door with a latch in the back for easy cleaning and maintenance.
