Ariana Grande performs at the EMA\u2019s dancing in front of the sun and lets her hair \u2018Break Free.\u2019 Welcome to Clevver\u2019s Trophy Life where we bring you all the best award show highlights. \nLast night at the Europe Music Awards in Scotland, Ariana Grande took the stage performing My Everything hits \u201cProblem\u201d and \u201cBreak Free.\u201d\nAriana wore this light grey peplum bodice top paired with silver short shorts that together, gave us full on zenon space suit, all paired with her classic thigh high boots. But one thing that wasn\u2019t classic about her appearance was that her hair was down! Who is this babed out girl? Ari NEVER wears her hair down because um hello, she already has a signature hair style that she\u2019s globally know for which is a thing we all can only aspire to, but its fun to see her switching things up, lookin\u2019 good girl. \nAfter performing \u201cProblem\u201d in front of the spinning vortex we recognize from the music video, Ari was then airlifted by a giant bubble to the main stage. A BUBBLE. It was full on space princess, Glinda fantasy. \nAri then broke out \u201cBreak Free,\u201d pun intended, during which she was elevated onto a rising platform complete with fire rockets blazing from the bottom as the sun blazed behind her. Ari\u2019s performance was straight up something out of Zenon and we loved every minute of it. Ari\u2019s boo, Big Sean clearly shared similar sentiments, tweeting during her performance saying QUOTE \u2013 \u201c@ArianaGrande shine bright my baby!!! U look amazing!\u201d \nUgh so flippin cute. Immediately following her performance, Ari quickly made her way back to the stage to adorably accept the award for Best Song for \u201cProblem.\u201d \nSo what did you guys think of Ariana\u2019s performance?

I think what we can say categorically is that the inflation scare from the relative price highs in commodities was a head fake. It was a head fake at a massive cyclical turning point for the economy. This is profoundly deflationary. All of this is untested. Japan is the only one that tested Quantitative easing. Where is the Nikkei 18 years later? \n\nFor all the talk of rising levels of government debt it is occurring at the same time as corporate and personal sector debt is contracting so they're cancelling themselves out and leaving us with this deflation.\n\nI think you're right on your emphasis with index-linked. You should be buying my American securities because the break-even rate is 6% (compared to 2% for the UK). I almost want to lose money on this thing! I'm guaranteed 6 real okay. For me to lose money prices in America have to fall by 6% this year and 6% next year. That's almost never, never happened. But let's say it does and let's say prices fall 20% over that period. Do you know where the S&P will be?? It will be like 300 points. And I will have lost 10%.

A mass of lymphoid tissue, it contains two distinct areas, the white pulp and the red pulp.  The white pulp is distributed, as tiny nodules of lymphatic tissue, among the red pulp, which fills all the remaining space.  The white pulp is responsible for the production of lymphocytes.  Some lymphocytes enter the blood, while others remain in the spleen, where they ingest and destroy foreign or damaged cells.  The red pulp contains many blood channels, expanded capillary lakes, which act as filters when blood is forced through them, removing damaged or abnormal red cells and allowing normal ones to pass through.  The lymphocytes then engulf and destroy these damaged red cells.  The spleen also acts as a store for red blood cells.", "title": "How the Body Works : The Spleen", "publishedDate": "2007-08-02T15:10:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Cqd-erFU7Q", "description": "Please be sure to leave a like: Also don't forget to subscribe!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=yourbeatsdaily\n\nAnother great music channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/BeyondMusicDaily", "title": "Sansevieria - Narnya", "publishedDate": "2013-02-02T16:26:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "0CrbhcXYG30", "description": "Gotta love it, couldn't have happened to a worse politician than Republican \"attack dog\" Barbara Comstock!", "title": "Tea Party Candidate Rips Barbara Comstock for Skipping Debates, Supporting Barack Obama: \"You Lie\"", "publishedDate": "2014-04-14T21:08:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Cs0ibDYzHo", "description": "Let's hit 15 Likes!!\n\n\n\nHey guys Grvty here bringing you guys a different kind of style to my ep.

He wants to get a really cool pet, and I want to get him a tarantula because it's a wow type of an animal to own.\" And it's a tough question to answer sometimes, because there's a lot of choices. But if I have to choose, here's the three I'd go for most of the time. Number one is the Chilean rose hair tarantula. And my criteria, being a father as well as a pet store owner, is that I really don't want anybody to get bitten. You never know what's going to happen from a tarantula bite, because people who are allergic to bee stings can have a hard time with it, and wasp stings. \n\nBut tarantula venom isn't something that is deadly, so to speak, but if you are allergic to it you could go into anaphylactic shock if you are bitten by a tarantula and it doesn't do well in your system. So let's pick a species, therefore, for a beginner, that is reluctant to bite. Number one on my list, again, the rose hair tarantula. Number two, if you're looking for a desert species that is also very, very calm, would be the palomino blonde. This is an American tarantula found in the deserts of Texas and the Southwest, kind of plodding, kind of slow-moving, not the most exciting tarantula maybe, just like the rose hair. They don't do much, but they're not going to flee from you, and they're certainly not going to bite you for any special reason. They're very, very docile creatures to deal with. \n\nSo I think that's a good criteria for a beginner. In terms of keeping, ten-gallon tank, desert, a little more humid environment when it comes to the rose hair. And they eat very, very infrequently. A couple of crickets once a week or some kind of an insect item, and they're good to go. All tarantulas need fresh water at all times. But you don't want to put a bowl in like you do for your cat or your dog.  You want to do a shallow dish, and we usually put a sponge or some type of moisture holding instrument that the tarantula more can suck on than he will drink. You don't want to give them a bowl. They can potentially drown in a bowl of water. So that's pretty straightforward and pretty simple. If you're looking to turn that up a notch, you want to go to the very, very beginner animal to the next step, phase two maybe, let's look at arboreal tarantula like the pink toe from Trinidad. \n\nThey are easily handled, easy to keep, small cage. Rather than a ten-gallon cage which is more vertical, you want one that's got some height because it's a tree-dwelling creature. The reason he's a secondary animal and a little more difficult to keep in these but still in the beginner class is because pink toes can be extremely quick. You can hold them, interface with them, but when he gets nervous, he darts, and he darts fast. So that makes him a little less of a beginner, but still in the beginner category for sure. The rose hair, the palomino blonde, or the pink toe would be my three readily available, inexpensive beginner tarantulas.

As such, we want you to know who we are so that you know who you are helping when you contribute to our campaign.\n\nI am from Youngstown, Ohio originally and currently live in Chicago. I have lived with a diagnosis of epilepsy for about twenty years. From this year alone, I have 70K in unpaid medical debt.\n\nThe conceptual basis for my work is heavily informed by the critical work of Judith Butler and Simi Linton.\n\nTypically I work in oil on canvas or spray paint and paint marker on canvas.\n\nAs you can probably make out behind me, my primary motifs are human figures in heavily abstracted representation.\n\nMy interest in this work centers on the Identity Work that I do to present as an independent, not needy person, that poses no risk to himself and requires no pity or paternalism.\n\nThis work is not generally recognized by society at large, even though it requires a lot of energy and resources. Many people do this work, not just people with epilepsy or other disabilities.\n\nI want to create art that reaches out to those people to say:\n - Yes, there are others doing this work.\n - Yes, it is exhausting.\n - Yes, success just means you neutralize your identity to make other people comfortable or otherwise get them to skip projecting stereotypes on to you.\n - This is what Identity Work looks like when I do it.\n\nThank audience for consideration.

Like other fairy creatures, leprechauns have been linked to the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann of Irish mythology. The Leprechauns spend all their time busily making shoes, and store away all their coins in a hidden pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. If ever captured by a human, the Leprechaun has the magical power to grant three wishes in exchange for their release. Popular depiction shows the Leprechaun as being no taller than a small child, with a beard and hat, although they may originally have been perceived as the tallest of the mound-dwellers (the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann).\"\nfrom wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprechaun", "title": "Real Leprechaun Caught on Tape by Southerner", "publishedDate": "2014-07-07T23:51:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "0D-JZ18ahNE", "description": "gibts nicht viel zusagen xD", "title": "Schnecke abgeschossen", "publishedDate": "2008-03-18T16:48:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "0D-NwmvvmAw", "description": "ESPN 4 Star Recruit Garfield High School State Champion 5 ft 9 Sophomore PG Jashaun Agosto had enough energy after a 4 hour workout to work on his dunking.

At the Super Soph Camp in Atlanta he had the fastest 3/4 court sprint time and the fastest Agility Lane time and had the highest vertical. All from a \"little\" point guard.

NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory detected these flares during the telescope's periodic observations of the black hole. A new study suggests that these flares may occur when the black hole - known as Sagittarrius A* or Sgr A* for short -- consumes an asteroid at least six miles wide. If an asteroid gets too close to another object like a star or planet, it can be thrown into an orbit headed toward Sgr A*. Once the asteroid passes within about 100 million miles of the black hole, it is torn into pieces by the black hole's tidal forces. Eventually, these fragments are vaporized by friction as they pass through the hot, thin gas flowing onto Sgr A*. This is what produces an X-ray flare. If confirmed, this result could mean that there is a cloud around Sgr A* containing trillions of asteroids and comets. This would be an exciting development for the many scientists who are fascinated by the Milky Way's giant black hole and the environment around it.", "title": "Sagittarius A*", "publishedDate": "2012-02-10T05:44:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DJYMQw7zJo", "description": "", "title": "~ Baking Soda Mask For Acne 02 10 2013 HD", "publishedDate": "2013-10-10T20:01:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DJjo63l0q4", "description": "http://www.marcellobarenghi.com\nSupport my FACEBOOK page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MarcelloBarenghi :)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON G+:\nhttps://plus.google.com/+marcellobarenghi\n\nFOLLOW ME ON TWITTER:\nhttps://twitter.com/BarenghiM\n\nMUSIC: by Jewelbeat.com  http://www.jewelbeat.com/\n(Standard Licence)\n\nFINAL PICTURE: \nhttp://www.marcellobarenghi.com/2014/08/500-euro-note-drawing.html\n\nDRAWING TOOLS AND ART SUPPLIES:\nhttp://www.marcellobarenghi.com/p/materials-used-for-my-drawing-video-on.html\nI also used my old airbrush for doing some shadows\n\nTHIS DRAWING TOOK ME:\n5 hours and 19 minutes\n\nCheck out the full drawing process in this youtube video!

Only 24 millimeters in length, the pacemaker is fed through an artery in a patient's leg and, using tiny prongs, is attached into place on the heart.\n\n\"These devices are 90 percent smaller than current pacemakers and don't require wires or leads to be fed through the patient's chest in order to work,\" said Dr. John Hummel, an Ohio State cardiologist who is among those leading the investigation into the effectiveness of the new generation of pacemakers.\n\n\"Getting rid of the leads cuts down on complications considerably,\" said Ohio State's Dr. Ralph Augostini. \"I think this is the biggest advancement in pacing technology in nearly 15 years.\"\n\nOnce in place, the pacemaker constantly monitors the condition of the patient and only activates when necessary.  \"That allows these devices to be extremely efficient,\" Hummel said.  \"With that kind of intermittent pacing, they could last as long as 14 years.\"\n\nFor more information, visit http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/Pages/index.aspx", "title": "New, Tiny Pacemaker Implanted Directly Into Heart", "publishedDate": "2014-05-01T14:03:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DQAxG1w5vQ", "description": "2011\u5e741\u5e74\u306e\u30ec\u30b2\u30a8\u30fb\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b\u3001REGGAE ZION\u3092\u8cd1\u308f\u3057\u305f\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u3001\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u8d08\u3089\u308c\u308b\u300eZION AWARD 2011\u300f\u306e\u300c\u7740\u3046\u305f\u90e8\u9580\u300d\u3067CHINO\u300cJourney\u300d\u304c\u898b\u4e8b\u5927\u8cde\u306b\u9078\u3070\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f!!!!!!!!\n\n2010\u5e74\u306e\u300cNever Change\u300d\u3067\u300c\u7740\u3046\u305f\u90e8\u9580\u300d\uff06\u300c\u7740\u3046\u305f\u30d5\u30eb\u90e8\u9580\u300d\u306e2\u51a0\u30b2\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u7d9a\u304d\u30012\u5e74\u9023\u7d9a\u306e\u300c\u7740\u3046\u305f\u90e8\u9580\u300dNO.1\u306f\u5feb\u6319\uff01\nhttp://ameblo.jp/reggaezion-music/day-20111214.html\n\n2012\u5e74\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u3001\u300cJourney\u300d\u6539\u3081\u3066\u3088\u308d\u3057\u304f\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3057\u307e\u3059\uff01", "title": "CHINO to JAPAN - ZION AWARD 2011", "publishedDate": "2012-01-06T01:06:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DQbHW0pVP0", "description": "All the rights belong to their respective owners", "title": "Lungfish -  Shapes in space", "publishedDate": "2011-06-30T21:45:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DQhMN1gIIo", "description": "Launching  my non biodegradable airplane from a mountain top", "title": "Launching  my non biodegradable airplane from a mountain top", "publishedDate": "2009-03-29T00:17:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DR1wHp9F-A", "description": "Universe- Co naprawd\u0119 we mnie \u015bpi Cover by ToMasso\nWybaczcie kiepsk\u0105 jako\u015b\u0107 nagarnia ( problemy techniczne)", "title": "Universe- Co naprawd\u0119 we mnie \u015bpi Cover by ToMasso", "publishedDate": "2014-07-24T19:39:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DREhOpczd8", "description": "feeding our little cubi", "title": "cubi cubi cubi (pomeranian)", "publishedDate": "2011-10-27T11:54:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DRi3F0IrlI", "description": "A really good newish Astrantia with the tall spires of Aconitum \"Bressingham Spire\" in the background.

Some of these products they will endorse, or in some shows no particular product is endorsed but the overall ingredient itself is. When it comes to healthier living and weight loss there are tons of supplements such as garcinia cambogia on the market.\n\nThese natural supplements are healthier for your body making it a better choice in diet supplements versus those that are chemically altered. They are not just healthier in name but in where they come from and what they can do for your body. With garcinia cambogia it comes from the fruit of the tamarind. This is a small pumpkin-like fruit that is found in many countries around the world. The fruit itself can be eaten but it has been found that the extract itself is where are the potent nutrients happen to be found.\n\nWhen you are shopping for garcinia cambogia you will often see it referred to as HCA which stands for the hydroxycitric acid that it contains. This natural nutrient helps raise a person's metabolism, suppresses the appetite, and blocks new fat from forming, all at the same time. While other natural supplements can do similar things, without having garcinia cambogia to back it up they cannot do all three.

When larvae consume nicotine-replete plants, their midgut-expressed cytochrome P450 6B46 (CYP6B46) is upregulated. The larvae in which CYP6B46 is silenced by plant-mediated RNAi excrete more of their ingested nicotine. Silencing CYP6B46 impairs the mechanisms of passing ingested nicotine from the midgut to the hemolymph to be exhaled from the spiracles during spider attack. Spiders are deterred by this nicotine-rich halitosis. Thus, the CYP6B46-silenced larvae exhale less nicotine and become ready spider prey, demonstrating that CYP6B46 functions to repurpose the normally excreted nicotine for defense.\n\nAbstract\nManduca sexta (Ms) larvae are known to efficiently excrete ingested nicotine when feeding on their nicotine-producing native hostplant, Nicotiana attenuata. Here we describe how ingested nicotine is co-opted for larval defense by a unique mechanism. Plant-mediated RNAi was used to silence a midgut-expressed, nicotine-induced cytochrome P450 6B46 (CYP6B46) in larvae consuming transgenic N. attenuata plants producing MsCYP6B46 dsRNA. These and transgenic nicotine-deficient plants were planted into native habitats to study the phenotypes of larvae feeding on these plants and the behavior of their predators. The attack-behavior of a native wolf spider (Camptocosa parallela), a major nocturnal predator, provided the key to understanding MsCYP6B46's function: spiders clearly preferred CYP6B46-silenced larvae, just as they had preferred larvae fed nicotine-deficient plants. MsCYP6B46 redirects a small amount (0.65%) of ingested nicotine from the midgut into hemolymph, from which nicotine is exhaled through the spiracles as an antispider signal. CYP6B46-silenced larvae were more susceptible to spider-attack because they exhaled less nicotine because of lower hemolymph nicotine concentrations. CYP6B46-silenced larvae were impaired in distributing ingested nicotine from midgut to hemolymph, but not in the clearing of hemolymph nicotine or in the exhalation of nicotine from hemolymph. MsCYP6B46 could be a component of a previously hypothesized pump that converts nicotine to a short-lived, transportable, metabolite. Other predators, big-eyed bugs, and antlion larvae were insensitive to this defense. Thus, chemical defenses, too toxic to sequester, can be repurposed for defensive functions through respiration as a form of defensive halitosis, and predators can assist the functional elucidation of herbivore genes.", "title": "Tobacco hornworm found to use nicotine to create 'defensive halitosis' (s3)", "publishedDate": "2014-01-01T17:37:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Dh2pzkvkYM", "description": "", "title": "Ali vs. Frazier III - Press conference", "publishedDate": "2014-02-12T18:44:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Dh8a_-UFb4", "description": "Actividad celebrada el 23 de noviembre de 2011 en el Edificio de Agronom\u00eda EEA R\u00edo Piedras.", "title": "Inauguraci\u00f3n Sal\u00f3n Video-Conferencia", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T17:26:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DhGOVHxfQ8", "description": "Watch a whole demo and download VST on: http://www.myvst.com/vst-instruments/protoplasm-pro-freeware\n\nHundreds of VST demos sorted by categories at http://myvst.com/", "title": "ProtoPlasm TSM Pro - Free VST - myVST Demo", "publishedDate": "2012-10-10T16:32:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DhHUMrtmPc", "description": "In this video, NVIDIA speaks to scientists at Temple University who are using GPUs to model \"surfactants\".

That was before we had a record contract. The version on this record is pretty different. A lot of people asked us why we didn't put it on the first album. But we felt because it was on Metal For Muthas we didn't want to put it on the first album. By the time we did Killers we weren't happy with that version so so we wanted to record it properly. The guitar frills around the vocals were from Adrian. Originally they weren't there but when Adrian joined the band he decided to put them in. '' (Steve Harris)\n\nThis is the classic track from Killers...It's catchy and accessible, and was originally recorded on the  Metal For Muthas compilation, which might be why it wasn't included on the previous album. It is about an angry young man searching for his unknown father, presumably with violent intentions. Nice bass intro too. ''\n\n'Killers' is the second album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released on February 2, 1981 in the UK, and June, 1981 in the US. The album was the first of their albums to feature guitarist  Adrian Smith, and the last to feature vocalist Paul Di'Anno, who was fired from the band mid-tour due to problems with alcohol  and cocaine. This was also the first Iron Maiden album produced by veteran producer Martin Birch who went on to produce their next eight albums before retiring after Fear of the Dark in 1992.", "title": "Iron Maiden - 03.Wrathchild (Mexic 1992)", "publishedDate": "2008-05-03T14:45:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Dpu1_mkVQE", "description": "We Are Family Part 2\nRedid and reuploaded\nI own nothing.\nedit: OVER 10,000 VIEWS?!

With 5,100 people in 15 plants across the continent, the EGGER Group manufactures more than five million cubic metres of chipboard, medium-density fibreboard and oriented strand board each year.\n\nChallenge\nFRITZ EGGER was running 16 separate SAP ERP environments, supporting a total of 2,000 users, on proprietary HP Alpha servers running HP True64 UNIX. The company had for some time wanted to move away from this proprietary hardware and software combination, both to reduce long-term costs and to free itself from reliance on a single vendor. When HP announced that the Alpha range was to be discontinued, FRITZ EGGER decided to actively seek out a new infrastructure for its SAP software.\n\nThe company wanted to retain its existing Oracle databases while moving to a new 64-bit operating system that would not lock it into buying proprietary hardware. As the SAP software is integral to FRITZ EGGER's business, the new infrastructure needed to offer high levels of performance and availability for the company's 2,000 business users.\n\nNovell Solution\nWorking with SAP AG, FRITZ EGGER selected SUSE\u00ae Linux Enterprise Server as the new platform for its ERP software, and opted to run it on AMD Opteron-based servers from HP. Some 58 servers, with a total of more than 250 processors and 1TB of memory, host the solution in FRITZ EGGER's St. Johann data centre.\n\n\"We had more than 10 years of experience with UNIX, so moving to Linux was a logical step,\" said Matthias Haidekker, Head of Data Center at FRITZ EGGER. \"The transition was relatively easy, since our employees could use their existing skills with very little re-training required. We opted for SUSE Linux Enterprise partly on SAP's recommendation, and partly on the strong reputation that the software has in the region.\"\n\nThis project was the world's biggest SAP implementation on x86 Linux, and is currently the second largest of its kind. The complexity and importance of the project called for close attention to detail and teamwork from the project partners: Novell for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, SteelEye Technology Inc. for high availability and SAP as the project lead.", "title": "Fritz Egger - Novell Customer Success Story", "publishedDate": "2010-09-07T20:45:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DwlOoDwOqw", "description": "http://my.datasphere.com/biz/kansas_city_regional_homes_inc-real_estate_real_estate_agents-lenexa_ks-12565396-226117\n\n\n\nGeorganne Senecaut is your Kansas real estate professional. \n \nKansas City Regional Homes is a full service real estate brokerage.

There have been victories in counties around the United States, and even the removal of sodium fluoride as far away as Germany, the Netherlands, and other nations.\n\nBut while we may not be able to remove toxic forms of fluoride from the global water supply just yet, we can actively make the decision to help remove it from our bodies. You may even have a water filter at home to help remove toxic substances from the water, but you may not yet actively be working to help remove these toxic substances from your body.\n\nThe Invention of Exclusive Fluoride Shield\u2122\n\nFollowing years of research and the request of listeners worldwide, Alex teamed up with Dr. Edward Group to find a solution to addressing the accumulation of toxic fluoride substances within the body. Ultimately, this led to countless hours of research on behalf of Dr. Edward Group, who began in late 2012 to find the highest quality ingredients when it came to supporting the body in the removal of toxic halogens.\n\nHere's what Dr. Edward Group had to say in regards to his 20-year-long specialized detoxification methods research:\n\n\"After years of research I am excited to announce one of the greatest product breakthroughs of all time, Fluoride Shield\u2122. The creation of this product came from the request of Anthony Gucciardi in late 2012, when he asked me if there was a product that could help people cleanse toxic fluoride from their system and help rejuvenate the pineal gland from calcification. I thought this was a great idea and started working on a product that has never been created before with such a unique blend of ingredients for the purpose of shielding fluoride from the body.\n\nThis led to countless days and hours spent creating the most powerful vegetable glycerin based herbal fluoride cleanser on the planet. My research started by looking into the past and studying the damaging effects of fluoride in the body, dating back to the early 1900's. First, I had to select the right ingredients. Then, I put to use a revolutionary, multi-step processing technique to extract the most powerful essence of the herbs and overall ingredients into a final blend which is harmonious and beneficial to the body. The ingredients chosen had to be either certified organic or grown under organic conditions, in balance with nature to obtain superior quality and potency.\n\nThe ingredients then had to be carefully dried with low heat and humidity, so that the ingredients could be processed in the liquid phase. Then, the ingredients proceed through a cold processing technique that preserves the plant's components, including enzyme activity, vitamins and co-factors and fragile essential oil complexes. We also capture heavy 'mole weight' essential aromatic components and sterols, oleoresins, (lipids and waxes), resinoids, high density polysaccharides and other constituents, all in their ratio-intact state.", "title": "Pineal Gland Protections", "publishedDate": "2013-12-20T00:44:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DxV9rllLx4", "description": "Ratchet & Clank Collection review. http://www.ClassicGameRoom.com\nShop CGR shirts & mugs! http://www.CGRstore.com\nClassic Game Room presents a CGR Undertow review of Ratchet & Clank Collection for Playstation 3 developed by Insomniac Games and Idol Minds and published by Sony Computer Entertainment.\n\nRatchet & Clank Collection is an HD port of the first three Ratchet & Clank games.

National Lampoon's Animal House is set in 1962 on the campus of Faber College in Faber, PA. The first glimpse we get of the campus is the statue of its founder Emil Faber, on the base of which is inscribed the motto, \"Knowledge Is Good.\" Incoming freshmen Larry \"Pinto\" Kroger (Tom Hulce) and Kent \"Flounder\" Dorfman (Stephen Furst) find themselves rejected by the pretentious Omega fraternity, and instead pledge to Delta House. The Deltas are a motley fraternity of rejects and maladjusted undergraduates (some approaching their late twenties) whose main goal -- seemingly accomplished in part by their mere presence on campus -- is disrupting the staid, peaceful, rigidly orthodox, and totally hypocritical social order of the school, as represented by the Omegas and the college's dean, Vernon Wormer (John Vernon). Dean Wormer decides that this is the year he's going to get the Deltas expelled and their chapter decertified; he places the fraternity on \"double secret probation\" and, with help from Omega president Greg Marmalard (James Daughton) and hard-nosed member Doug Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalf), starts looking for any pretext on which to bring the members of the Delta fraternity up on charges. The Deltas, oblivious to the danger they're in, are having a great time, steeped in irreverence, mild debauchery, and occasional drunkenness, led by seniors Otter (Tim Matheson), Hoover (James Widdoes), D-Day (Bruce McGill), Boon (Peter Riegert), and pledge master John \"Bluto\" Blutarsky (John Belushi). They're given enough rope to hang themselves, but even then manage to get into comical misadventures on a road trip (where they arrange an assignation with a group of young ladies from Emily Dickinson University). Finally, they are thrown out of school, and, as a result, stripped of their student deferments (and, thus, eligible for the draft). They decide to commit one last, utterly senseless (and screamingly funny) slapstick act of rebellion, making a shambles of the university's annual homecoming parade, and, in the process, getting revenge on the dean, the Omegas, and everyone else who has ever gone against them.\n\n\"animal house\",\"animal house clip\",\"animal house shout\",\"animal house trailer\",\"tim matheson\",\"peter riegert\",\"stephen furst\",\"john vernon\",\"mark metcalf\",\"john landis\",\"golf ball videos\",\"golf club videos\",\"helmet videos\",\"horse videos\",comedy,\"cult comedies\",\"late night comedies\",\"ivan reitman\",\"matty simmons\",\"authority videos\",\"conflict videos\",\"karma videos\",\"power videos\",\"field videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++60324,/m/026n2y,/m/05v259,/m/036c_0,/m/04sx9_,/m/053hyn", "title": "Animal House (3/10) Movie CLIP - Only We Can Do That to Our Pledges (1978) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T14:53:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DyI5FMISLI", "description": "Siku za Kwanza 100 - Health", "title": "Siku za Kwanza 100 - Health", "publishedDate": "2013-02-21T06:18:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "0DyV8gAFxpE", "description": "This guitar is a real eye-catcher, the black lacquer shines light night and the Monkey Pod has it's golden glow.

Pain relief and healing is generally quick and easy with improvements in blood supply and strengthening back, shoulder and neck muscles. \n1. Practice yoga for neck pain relief regularly.\n\n2.

Both suspects were shot and remain in hospital.\nA Scotland Yard spokesman told CNN the arrest at the BBC was not connected to the murder investigation in Woolwich.\nThe brutal killing has sparked concerns that anti-Muslim sentiment may flare up in communities angered by the killing of the soldier, Drummer Lee Rigby.\nMembers of a far-right group, the English Defence League, called for Muslims to leave Britain as they rallied in Newcastle, northern England, on Saturday. The protest march came only hours after a group which monitors anti-Muslim abuse told CNN of a big spike in reported incidents in the past two days.\n'Changed and withdrawn'\nIn the interview with BBC's Newsnight, Nusaybah said MI5 had approached Adebolajo in the past year, asking if he wanted to work for them.\nAdebolajo rejected the approach, according to his friend.\nAbu Nusaybah said the contact from MI5 occurred last year after Adebolajo returned from a visit to Kenya during which he was detained by security forces.\nAdebolajo told his friend that he was physically assaulted and sexually threatened during his detention.\nCNN is working to independently verify the allegations made by Abu Nusaybah about his friend's treatment in detention.\nAbu Nusaybah went on to say that Adebolajo appeared changed and withdrawn after his return from Kenya.\nThe pair first met in 2002, he said. Abu Nusaybah had converted to Islam in late 2004 and Adebolajo followed suit about four months later, he said.\nA security source told CNN that \"we would never comment\" on the kind of allegations made in the interview.\nLondon's Metropolitan Police Service said a 31-year-old man had been arrested in London Friday night on terrorism-related offenses, but following standard practice would not give the arrested man's name.\nOfficers from Counter Terrorism Command arrested the man under the Terrorism Act, on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. He was taken to a south London police station, where he remains in custody, a police statement said.\nSearch warrants were being executed at two residential addresses in east London, police said.\n'Al Muhajiroun connections'\nA self-proclaimed former radical associate of Abu Nusaybah told CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank he had been a follower of the group Al-Muhajiroun, a British group of Islamic extremists virulently opposed to UK intervention in Iraq and openly supportive of al Qaeda.\nThe former associate -- who spoke to CNN on condition of not being named -- spent time with Nusaybah in Al-Muhajiroun study groups in Luton, a town north of London, in the years leading up to the July 7, 2005 attacks on London's transit system, he said.\nAt the time, Adebolajo himself was a follower of the group and attended meetings in London, according to several Al-Muhajiroun insiders, before moving away from the group two or three years ago.\n\"Abu Nusaybah was very quiet, always smiling, and very religious,\" said his former friend, who has now shed his radical views.\nHe said their circle of friends in Luton included Taimour Abdulwahab al Abdaly, who carried out a suicide bombing in Stockholm in December 2010 in which he was the only fatality.\nHe said Abu Nusaybah had connections to a grouping of Somali extremists in Luton.\nGory video\nThe brutal slaying of Rigby near the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, a working-class neighborhood in southeast London, shocked people across the United Kingdom.", "title": "Michael Adebolajo's Friend Arrested at BBC after MI5 Recruit Interview as Rigby Mourned", "publishedDate": "2013-05-25T15:43:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "0EKxl1x2ad8", "description": "Subscribe to Explosm! - http://bit.ly/13xgq7a\nRead Our Comics! - http://www.explosm.net/comics/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/explosm\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/explosm\n\nDon't!\n\nCyanide and Happiness delivers daily comics to your face-hole on www.explosm.net since 2005!", "title": "Don't Go To Space - Cyanide & Happiness Shorts", "publishedDate": "2014-09-25T05:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "0EKz5Y9FKn4", "description": "", "title": "Sacmi - Outdoor Olfactory System", "publishedDate": "2013-11-19T16:35:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "0EL02CSbFUw", "description": "neve", "title": "Neve em Lloret de Mar", "publishedDate": "2010-04-22T19:21:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "0EL4HMQ2KPg", "description": "http://www.spiritdetox.com Feed, your Pets, Body and Spirit\nAnimal nutrition is vital to the health of both domesticated and wild creatures, as it is literally their fuel for life. It aids their immune system, allows them to grow strong, and gives them the ability to stave off the pathogens, bacteria, and toxins that plague our environmentally challenged planet. Because the body manufactures very few vitamins and absolutely no minerals, the only real animal nutrition domesticated animals receive comes from the foods that we feed them.\n \nTraditional Feeds, Processed Foods, Earthly Grains: Not Sufficient for Animal Nutrition\n\nDomesticated animals primarily reside in man-made structures and eat man-made processed foods and grains that typically hail from overworked and depleted soils whose minerals and nutrients have been drained by extensive and harmful farming techniques. Essentially, this means that the ideal combination of minerals for animal nutrition is not available with the food chain. To boot, both farm animals and pets' foods are often tainted with chemical insecticides, preservatives, and synthetic hormones.\n\nStudies show that caged and domesticated animals tend to be more prone to disease and often have shorter life spans due to weakened immune systems. It is believed that diet deficiencies within the scope of animal nutrition contributes greatly to this concerning trend. Because our society is not likely to stop harboring domesticated animals, the next option is to allow our animals to take clues from free-roaming wildlife.\n \n Where the Wild Things Seek out Animal Nutrition\n\nIn the wild, when an animal is sick or nutrient deficient, they seem to possess and instinctual tendency to seek out treatments from clay licks, which are filled with nutrients and minerals. In fact, many animals (and even humans) seek out edible clay as food for sustenance. These remarkable creatures have the ability to find all the animal nutrition they need along riverbanks, exposed surface deposits, glaciers, caves, and runoff areas. Their instinctual clay eating provides them with a vast resource of minerals that foster animal nutrition, which also has the amazing ability to help them heal from various infections, illnesses, and other ailments.\n\nVisit: http://www.spiritdetox.com for more information", "title": "Nutramin Nutrition 101  - Clean and Feed your Pets, Body and Spirt", "publishedDate": "2013-04-28T01:16:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "0EL4L1-jfQc", "description": "Czo\u0142\u00f3wka serialu ameryka\u0144skiego \"Dempsey i Makepeace na tropie\"", "title": "Dempsey i Makepeace - czo\u0142\u00f3wka", "publishedDate": "2011-01-28T17:41:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ELlianFnL0", "description": "The horror author says writing is a form of self-hypnosis and having a daily routine helps him fall into a trance.", "title": "Stephen King: 'Writing is hypnosis'", "publishedDate": "2010-10-06T12:07:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ELwvErIMOU", "description": "Circle High and Wide, Snout, ANDA233 Au-go-go 1998, second single from long player Circle High & Wide, ANDA236 Au-go-go", "title": "Snout - Circle High And Wide", "publishedDate": "2009-07-10T21:44:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "0EM9ztXmyKM", "description": "\u05e7\u05d1\u05dc\u05d4,\u05e7\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1,\u05e7\u05d1\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e7\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1,\u05e7\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 \u05e7\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9, ,kabbalah,kabbalah comics,comics,god,religion,jewish,israel,hebrew,spiritual,jew,meditation,tarot,jerusalem,jews,Judaism,israeli,aviv,rabbi,tel aviv,isreal,torah,synagogue,tree of life,hotels israel,yeshiva,israel palestine,jewish community,jewish holidays,travel israel,moshe,new israel,israel aviv,jerusalem israel,jewish singles,judaica,tel aviv israel,jewish history,mysticism,tel israel,israel's,zionist,Zohar,hotel israel,israel center,red string,volumenes,anti semitic,israel flights,israel history,israel music,israel war,jewish home,haifa israel,israel tours,eilat israel,gematria,israel conflict,israel tour,israel trip,jew jokes,jew of,jewish jokes,judaic,jewish culture,jewish studies,kabala,kaballah,red thread,cabala,jewish mother,the jew of,the kabbalah,wandering jew,jewish tradition,jewish pictures,jewish review,jewish week,orthodox jew,jewish living,jewish press,jewish rabbi,jewish state,kabalah,the jewish home,american\u05e7\u05d1\u05dc\u05d4  http://www.jej.cc", "title": "Kabbalah Kabala Cabala Cabbalah Qabala \u05e7\u05d1\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e7\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9 \u05de\u05d9\u05e1\u05d8\u05d9\u05e7\u05d4_comics", "publishedDate": "2010-11-08T15:22:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "0EMCjZlnnNA", "description": "coffs harbour dolphins jumping", "title": "pet porpoise pool coffs harbour dolphins jumping", "publishedDate": "2012-04-16T12:15:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "0EMF2XxO6Ug", "description": "", "title": "Benzion Witler - Undzer Nigendl", "publishedDate": "2013-02-05T21:54:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "0EMIkrfTqPw", "description": "JB asks, \"How can I create a Comparative Histogram?\" Today, in Episode #1522, Bill shows us how to set up our Data, create Data Lables, and Formatting for creating a Comparative Histogram Chart.\n\nToday's Episode is brought to you by \"Easy-XL\".

Here's how.\n\nRich shortbread is easy to prepare and keeps for several days in an airtight container. Softened butter should be pliable but not easily spreadable. You can also use grated orange rind in place of lemon. A little bit of cornstarch ensures a short texture in the cookies.\n\n\nPreparation\n\n1. Weigh or lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup; level with a knife. Combine flour, cornstarch, lemon rind, and salt in a small bowl; stir with a whisk.\n\n2. Place sugar, butter, and oil in a medium bowl; mix with hands until combined. Add flour mixture, and mix with hands until combined; knead dough lightly 4 times or just until smooth. Wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate 30 minutes.\n\n3. Preheat oven to 325\u00b0.\n\n4. Place dough on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray; press dough into an 8 x 5--inch rectangle about 3/8-inch thick. Pierce entire surface liberally with a fork. Bake at 325\u00b0 for 30 minutes or just until set and edges are golden. Cut shortbread into 24 pieces.

The Android 4.1.2 handset features a 5-inch HD (1,280 x 720) IPS display, 1GB RAM and offers enhanced functionality with an optional capacitive stylus and specialized apps such as a notebook and movie editor -- this in addition to packing that previously announced 1.2GHz quad-core MT6589 SoC from MediaTek.\n\nWith the One Touch Scribe HD, Alcatel is aiming to bring stylus functionality to those unable to afford Samsung's Galaxy Note II. The phone will sell in the ballpark of $400 and is set for US availability in Q3, complete with an optional flip cover. The Scribe HD sports an 8-megapixel rear shooter, a front-facing camera that captures 720p video, 4GB built-in storage, a microSD card slot and a 2,500mAh battery. In terms of connectivity, the handset supports quad-band GSM and offers HSPA+ in three different configurations: 900 / 2100MHz, 850 / 1900 / 2100MHz and 850 / 1700 (AWS) / 2100MHz.\n\nWe spent a few minutes with the Scribe HD in Las Vegas and it felt well made. In terms of design the smartphone is somewhat reminiscent of both HTC's One X (the overall shape and unibody shell) and Samsung's Galaxy Note II (the camera pod and shiny finish). The screen looks decent enough, sort of middle of the pack for an HD IPS display. Performance was a bit more sluggish than during our Mediatek hands-on -- then again, the Scribe HD we handled was not running final software. We particularly enjoyed the flip cover, which latches on magnetically like Apple's Smart Cover and povides the same premium experience.

Then her doctor told her she was at risk for gestational diabetes and he suggested medication.  At 29 years old Angie didn't want that to be her solution.\n\nHer mother Therese Musyznski took action and dragged her out for a power walk, threw in some push ups and squats and got her) excited about fitness again. Plus she sent her the TurboFire workout DVDs, which Angie loved.

Try typing \"dsd160 -xr\" into the command prompt at step 5 instead. More DSD options for other digital signals can be found by looking at the DSD help screen by typing in \"dsd160 -h\".\n\nTo get good decodes (for most soundcards), the volume settings in SDRSharp and Windows should be played with until \"inlvl\" reads at approximately 30% for best performance. Note that all soundcards are different, and DSD may get better performance at a different percentage on your computer.\n\nTo stop DSD, simply press \"ctrl + c\" at the command prompt while it is running.\n\nSome Tips\n\nIf you don't know what P25, MOTOTRBO, ProVoice or any digital voice signals sound like, this page has some more example audio files.\nYou can simply manually scan through various signals, and see if DSD starts scrolling text to see if a signal is supported. DSD will start attempting to decode immediately. Note however that DSD will also scroll text on trunking channels, but will not be able to decode them. See the next section for information on decoding trunking channels.\nA strong signal is required for DSD to decode audio well. Ensure you are using a good antenna and have set the RTL-SDR gain correctly.\nDSD will listen to the default windows sound recording device. Make sure virtual audio cable or VB-cable is set as the default device. No text will be scrolling within DSD if the wrong audio device is used.\nStereo mix can be used, but you will be hearing both the digital signal as well as the decoded voice at the same time. Also, the decoded voice audio will be pumped back into DSD causing a detrimental feedback loop.\nDSD is software in development and may not perform as well as a commercial digital rad", "title": "DECODING DIGITAL VOICE (P25) WITH DSD", "publishedDate": "2013-12-10T19:17:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "0EYEgfl9HPY", "description": "http://kcm.org/next - In this video Kenneth Copeland Ministries Minister of Evangelism Riley Stephenson shares about undrestanding waater baptism.  \n\nFor more information go to http://kcm.org  For prayer call: 817.852.6000", "title": "Understanding Water Baptism", "publishedDate": "2012-06-27T21:07:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "0EYSE2WHXNY", "description": "tr\u00e8s marrant on dirait qu'il a abus\u00e9 de cannabis", "title": "casting chant algerien Mort de rire / very funny Algerian singing cast", "publishedDate": "2014-02-14T23:30:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "0EYl-btrafM", "description": "How to pick exterior house paint colors.

Pizzo, droga e armi sul litorale Domitio, nel Casertano: i carabinieri hanno eseguito dieci ordinanze d'arresto nei confronti di affiliati alla fazione ''Schiavone'' del clan dei Casalesi. Sono tutti ritenuti responsabili di vari episodi estorsivi aggravati dall'uso delle armi e dal metodo mafioso. Tra le vittime anche proprietari di noti stabilimenti balneari, bar ed esercizi commercianti del litorale di Castel Volturno. Il racket era imposto anche a chi gestiva le piazze di spaccio, ai parcheggiatori abusivi e ai noleggiatori di videopoker. Fermate, inoltre, quattro persone per spaccio di sostanze stupefacenti, tra cui due donne ritenute referenti del traffico di droga sul litorale. \n\nI presunti estorsori, arrestati carabinieri della compagnia di Mondragone a Castel Volturno (Caserta), nell'ambito di un'inchiesta coordinata dai pm della Dda di Napoli, Cesare Siringano e Giovanni Conzo,  hanno poco meno di trent'anni. Si tratta di Marco Giangrande e Daniele Paone, sottoposti a fermo insieme a Mirko Ponticelli, altro presunto referente del clan al Villaggio Coppola.

As early germination vessels appear dull pain unspecified in the corresponding half of the chest. Then the pain becomes more intense, excruciating. Analgesics bring short-term relief. Periodically, there is a low-grade fever. Accumulation of fluid accompanied by a feeling of heaviness in the chest, shortness of breath. Patients take a forced situation in bed with a raised upper half of his body, prefer to sleep on the affected side.\nSeen from the side of the patient revealed the smoothness of intercostals spaces (much better than in lean patients), the lag in breathing that half of the chest, with percussion - percussion shortening up to the hip, which is projected onto the skin in the form of a characteristic curved lines (line Elissa - Damuazo - Sokolov).

Then it fills with liquids containing enzymes which break down organic matter into simpler chemical compounds. These compouds are then used by the plant for growth. The trap constricts tightly around the insect and secretes digestive juices, much like those in your stomach. It dissolves the soft, inner parts of the insect, but not the tough, outer part called the exoskeleton. At the end of the digestive process, which takes from five to twelve days, the trap reabsorbs the digestive fluid and then reopens. The leftover parts of the insect, the exoskeleton, blow away in the wind or are washed away by rain. http://www.botany.org/bsa/misc/carn.html\n\nD\u00fdr\u00e6tur \u00ed jurtar\u00edkinu Eftir: Ingimar \u00d3skarsson \u00ed N\u00e1tt\u00farufr\u00e6\u00f0ingnum 1970 :  \u00c1ri\u00f0 1769 f\u00e9kk hinn heimsfr\u00e6gi, s\u00e6nski n\u00e1tt\u00farufr\u00e6\u00f0ingur Carl von Linn\u00e9 sendibr\u00e9f fr\u00e1 enskum kaupmanni; s\u00e1 h\u00e9t John Ellis. \u00cd br\u00e9fi \u00feessu segir svo, me\u00f0al annars: ,,\u00c9g sendi y\u00f0ur h\u00e9r me\u00f0 n\u00e1kv\u00e6ma teikningu \u00e1samt bl\u00f6\u00f0um og bl\u00f3mi af einhverri jurt, sem vir\u00f0ist hafa annars konar matar\u00e6\u00f0i en almennt gerist me\u00f0al jurta.

They are typically depicted as mindless, reanimated corpses with a hunger for human flesh, and particularly for human brains in some depictions. Although they share their name and some superficial similarities with the zombie from Haitian Vodun, their links to such folklore are unclear and many consider George A. Romero's seminal film The Night of the Living Dead to be the progenitor of these creatures. Zombies have a complex literary heritage, with antecedants ranging from Richard Matheson and H. P. Lovecraft to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, all drawing on folkloric legends of the flesh-hungry undead. The zombie apocalypse, the civilised world brought low by a global zombie infestation, has become a staple of modern popular art. By 2011 the influence of zombies in popular consciousness had reached far enough that government agencies were using them to garner greater attention in public service messages.\nA zombie (Haitian Creole: zonbi; North Mbundu: nzumbe) is an animated corpse brought back to life by mystical means, such as witchcraft.[1] The term is often figuratively applied to describe a hypnotized person bereft of consciousness and self-awareness, yet ambulant and able to respond to surrounding stimuli. Since the late 19th century, zombies have acquired notable popularity, especially in North American and European folklore.\nThe Philidelpia Band, \"The Hooters\" wrote a song called \"All You Zombies\" in the 1980's and we all thought it was pretty cool at the time.", "title": "One Direction!

Revenge can be so sweet.\n\nThe squash vine borer is a key pest of winter squash, gourds and pumpkins. Unfortunately, it is usually noticed only after it has done its damage. Symptoms appear in mid summer when a long runner or an entire plant wilts suddenly. Infested vines usually die beyond the point of attack.\n\nSawdust like frass near the base of the plant is the best evidence of squash vine borer activity. Careful examination will uncover yellow brown excrement pushed out through holes in the side of the stem at the point of wilting. If the stem is split open, one to several borers are usually present. The caterpillars reach a length of 1 inch and have a brown head and a cream colored body. Winter squash, particularly 'Hubbard', are most susceptible to damage while 'Butternut' is somewhat resistant.\n\nThe adult squash vine borer is a stout dark gray moth with 'hairy' red hind legs, opaque front wings, and clear hind wings with dark veins. Unlike most moths, they fly about the plants during the daytime, appearing more like a paper wasp than a moth. \n\nThis insect overwinters as a full grown larva or a pupa one to two inches below the soil surface. If it has not already done so, the larva pupates in the spring. Adult moths begin to emerge about the time the plants begin to run, and moth flight continues through mid August.\n\n \nThe small brown eggs, laid individually on leaf stalks and vines, hatch in seven to 10 days. The newly hatched larva immediately bores into the stem. A larva feeds for 14 to 30 days before exiting the stem to pupate in the soil.

William Ewart Gladstone, often regarded as one of the greatest British Prime Minister, recorded his greetings (Salutation) to Edison, on a Yellow Parafine Wax Cylinder (later moulded to a Blue Amberol copy), December 18th, 1888. The original Cylinder is now preserved in Edison National Historic Site in New Jersey, USA. (NHS Object Catalogue number : EDIS -SRP-39852)\n\nHere is the transcription of the recording.\n\nCHARLES GOURAUD :\n\nLondon, 18th December 1888. To Edison from Colonel Gouraud, introducing Mr Gladstone. The Phonograph Salutation.\n\nThe latest-born of science and American genius bends its knee of steel and bows its neck of iron in reverential homage before the veteran statesman of England. Mr Gladstone, the phonograph salutes you, and through the medium of the phonograph, Mr Edison greets you. Now, Edison, listen to a voice that has electrified its generation - the voice of William Ewart Gladstone;\n\nGLADSTONE:\n\nDear Mr Edison, I am profoundly indebted to you for, not the entertainment only, but the instruction and the marvels of one of the most remarkable evenings which it has been my privilege to enjoy. The request, that you have done me the honour to make - to receive the record of my voice - is one that I cheerfully comply with so far as it lies in my power; though I lament to say that the voice which I transmit to you is only the relic of an organ, the employment of which has been overstrained. Yet I offer to you as much as I possess and so much as old age has left me, with the utmost satisfaction, as being, at least, a testimony to the instruction and delight that I have received from your marvellous invention. As to future consequences it is impossible to anticipate them. All I see is that wonders upon wonders are opening before us. Your great country is leading the way in the important work of invention. Heartily do we wish it well. And to you, as one of its greatest celebrities, allow me to offer my hearty good wishes and earnest prayers that you may long live to witness its triumphs in all that appertains to the well-being of mankind. William Ewart Gladstone.\n\n\nThe recording is really hard to understand (barely audible!) since Gladstone was too far from the recording horn, and it was very difficult to understand even back in 1888. So what Edison did (*He collected Celebrities' recordings to use them as commercial endorsements of his Phonograph) was to make a false copies of Gladstone speech, so there are more than three different recordings of \"Gladstone\" today. \n\nBBC have broadcasted one of the forgeries on their documentary program, and somebody uploaded another fake on YT  (another forgery, which belong to the British Library), but this recording I present here, with the introduction of Colonel Charles Gouraud, is the genuine, authentic recording. \n\nI enhanced the Gladstone speech as best as I can (I left the Gouraud recording un-enhanced.), but it is still very hard to understand. But, anyway, it's nice to hear someone great actually TALKING from more than 120 years ago!", "title": "(Rare!)

It is a great little cleaner and one of my favorites. Watch my review to see if this is the right cleaner for your pool.\n\nI've been installing cleaners for years. My default cleaner was the Kreepy Krauly. I would shy away from the Navigator - too many parts.\n\nSo the Kreepy Krauly is the one I use the most, very durable and the one moving part has a lifetime warranty. It does have trouble in some pools with Oak nuts form Oak trees & larger debris.\n\nThe Pool Cleaner is a great cleaner that works in pools with Oak nuts. It has a large rectangular opening (larger than the Navigator) and pick's up everything.\n\nThis cleaner will actually clean the entire pool in 5 or 6 hours by going 8-10 ft, turning slightly and then go another 8-10 ft. It won't get stuck on steps because it has a great swivel that will turn it when it hits the step. It also can go all the way up the walls if you wish- by increasing the suction. I have them in 2 huge pools - 30,000 & 40,000 gallons and this 2 wheel version works great.\n\nPool Cleaner won't disappoint. Great cleaner. They also have great tech support if you ever run into trouble.\n\nCompany name is pronounced \"pool-fairg-nyoo-gen\" (German for pool enjoyment) and they're based in Santa Rosa (Northern CA).\n\nPoolvergnuegen Playlist:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsvsTjbpoT-f4qYUPi5C0So5_n75a9GDw\n\nAUTOMATIC POOL CLEANER PLAYLIST:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7E44FEAE1310746D&feature=view_all \n\nOTHER CLEANER REVIEWS:\nAutomatic Pool Cleaner Review- Top 10 Cleaners: http://youtu.be/A1VaqsS2ZxU\nPool professional's review of the Zodiac G2 Automatic Pool Cleaner. See it in action and learn about the various parts and accessories available.\n\nBarracuda makes several of these cleaners, Wahoo, G2, G3, G4. The G2 is there middle of the road cleaner and the best of the bunch. The G3 is a bit heavy and moves slow requiring more suction. The G4 is also bulky and has some expensive parts. Plus the G4 lacks a bumper, so it gets hung up in corners and by the steps much more than this cleaner\n\nThe G2 is light and requires very little suction. It is very durable, and the parts are not too expensive. The bumper works great getting out of the step area. There is also a great after market part called the Twister (made by Solar Sun Rings). It attaches to the hose and turns them completely 3 times every hour, so the cleaner never gets stuck in a corner or by the steps.\n\nDepending on the pool suction will determine what size debris this thing will pick up. It has no problem with Avocado tree debris, but struggles a bit with oak tree nuts. There are few cleaners that can handle oak trees but they do make them.\n\nThe only part that you need to replace annually is the diaphragm. It is the only moving part, and it will wear out, and form a tear. If the cleaner stops moving and there is no debris obstructing it, chances are the diaphragm has a slight tear. The smallest tear will stop it dead. They run about $20.00. The other parts should last 3 years before you start to see wear (Footpad & fin disk - big round bottom part).\n\nThis cleaner is light so it tends to come out of the pool as it climbs the wall. Simply lower the suction if you have a side port or add a weight to the top. It still may pop out and suck some air so play with the suction power until this happens on rare occasions.\n\nIf you are looking for an affordable and durable cleaner this is the one for you.

The blocky styling, wild colors and wilder interior appointments of Dartz creations prove that, although money can't buy taste, it can buy vehicles that are truly distinctive.\n   The wackiest automaker for the rich, Dartz, has released its Drive Hard rendition of the Mercedes Benz G63 AMG 6x6, that features +1,000hp and a whopping price of 2.4 million Euros. It seems this insane SUV may be a little too tame for some wealthy Russians' tastes, and with some additional treatment to fill the gap in their expensive habits required, so now, Dartz has revealed the Red Russian edition of this car, that even enlists interesting characters to promote it.", "title": "Go Hard like Vladimir Putin - DrIvE Hard like Vladimir Putin", "publishedDate": "2014-06-24T21:59:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "0FH64gYuEdc", "description": "This version can be seen from \"Run\" to \"Truly Madly Deeply\".

This would partially offset oil supplies from foreign countries, which currently represent over one-half of U.S. consumption. As policy makers search for ways to capture and sequester CO2 from industrial sources, it is clear that utilizing depleted American oil fields is the best proven opportunity to safely make carbon capture and sequestration (\"CCS\") a reality in the near term.\n\nIn 2006, the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\") estimated that in the Gulf Coast region (Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and southeast Texas), originally contained approximately 78.9 billion barrels of oil in place. In the Rocky Mountain region (Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming), it is estimated that the original oil in place was approximately 35.6 billion barrels. Assuming that sufficient supplies of CO2 are captured and delivered to the oil fields in these regions, the DOE estimates that there are up to 7.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the Gulf Coast region and up to 3.2 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the Rocky Mountain region that could be recovered through CO2 EOR.\n\nFor more information on Denbury Resources Inc., please visit www.denbury.com.", "title": "Denbury Resources CO2 Sequestration & Enhanced Oil Recovery", "publishedDate": "2009-09-21T21:22:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "0FmP8gUNcQs", "description": "Antony Jinman, British Explorer, teamed with us for an amazing expedition.This is the first time ever a toy is flying over the South Pole!\nSuch an expedition requires not only months of preparation but also a comprehensive equipment including our AR.Drone 2.0 + GPS Flight Recorder, as detailed here: http://blog.parrot.com/2013/12/12/ar-drone-antarctica-a-mission-to-reach-south-pole/", "title": "Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 flying over South Pole in Antarctica", "publishedDate": "2014-03-14T17:14:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "0FmPg4lrBKc", "description": "Music video by Santana performing Winning.

This makes him indispensable in collaring dangerous criminals, but a liability to any potential partners. Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), a conservative family man who wants to stay alive for his upcoming 50th birthday, is partnered with Riggs. As Riggs gets to know Murtaugh and his family, he begins to mellow, though his insistence on using guerilla tactics to catch criminals is still (put mildly) above and beyond the call of duty. The main villain is The General (Mitchell Ryan), a drug dealer responsible for the death of the daughter of one of Murtaugh's oldest friends. The General is also in charge of a deadly, militia-like gang of smugglers. Adding fuel to the fire is The General's chief henchman, played with all stops out by Gary Busey. Moviegoers familiar only with the relatively tongue-in-cheek Lethal Weapon sequels may be amazed to find out how dangerous and unpredictable Riggs is in the first Lethal Weapon -- and how likely it seems that Murtaugh might not survive until fade-out time.\n\n\"lethal weapon\",\"lethal weapon clip\",\"lethal weapon 5\",\"lethal weapon full movie\",\"lethal weapon 4\",\"lethal weapon 2\",\"lethal weapon 3\",\"crime action\",\"sergeant martin riggs\",\"richard donner\",\"action adventure\",\"competition videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"gun videos\",blockbusters,\"joel silver\",\"respect videos\",\"mel gibson\",\"target videos\",\"danny glover\",\"action comedies\",\"jennie lew tugend\",\"sergeant roger murtaugh\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++29103,/m/0c1pj,/m/0205dx", "title": "Lethal Weapon (7/10) Movie CLIP - Have a Nice Day (1987) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T18:37:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "0FnoBrFdv2o", "description": "Dr  Francisco Poyales del Instituto de Oftalmol\u00f3g\u00eda Avanzada de Madrid (Grupo Innova Ocular) nos explica las ventajas de la lente TRIFOCAL FineVision y las principales diferencias con las anteriores lentes multifocales bifocales.\n\nLa lente multifocal TRIFOCAL FineVision permite solucionar la Catarata, la Presbicia o vista cansada (en las 3 distancias: cerca, intermedia y lejos), la Miop\u00eda, la Hipermetrop\u00eda y el Astigmatismo con una sola cirug\u00eda segura y fiable.\n\nLente intraocular multifocal TRIFOCAL fabricada por Physiol y distribuida por Medical Mix en Espa\u00f1a.\nwww.medicalmix.com\n\nS\u00edguenos en Facebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/medicalmix\n\nS\u00edguenos en Twitter\nhttp://twitter.com/medicalmix\n\nS\u00edguenos en LinkedIn\nhttp://linkedin.com/company/medical-mix", "title": "Testimonio lente multifocal TRIFOCAL FineVision - Dr. Poyales", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T09:57:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "0FoU_4m1VP0", "description": "Withered\n\nTime to Laugh, Kingston Ontario - Canada\n26/11/10\n\nSetlist:\n1.The Forsaken Truth\n2.Purification of Ignorance\n3.Extinguished With the Weary\n4.The Progenitor's Grasp", "title": "Withered - The Progenitor's Grasp", "publishedDate": "2011-01-30T22:01:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "0FoXrp8Jqco", "description": "Ford Explorer\n2002-05 models mfg. after Oct. 2001\n\nresults also apply to: 2003-05 Lincoln Aviator | 2002-05 Mercury Mountaineer (mfg. after Oct. 2001)\nFRONTAL OFFSET TEST\n\nOVERALL EVALUATION: Good\nStructure/safety cage  Injury measures  Restraints/dummy kinematics\nHead/neck  Chest  Leg/foot, left  Leg/foot, right\nGood  Good  Good  Good  Acceptable  Good\n\nImportant: Frontal crash test ratings can be compared only among vehicles of similar weight.\nTest details:\n\nThe Ford Explorer 4-door (except the Sport Trac model) and the Mercury Mountaineer were redesigned for the 2002 model year.

Things for her business start off badly when a shipment perishes due to the operation of the Eastern & Portland Railroad, newly acquired by penny-pinching Harry Foster Malone. When the E&P fails to compensate Jane adequately for their error, Jane gets into a David versus Goliath battle with the powerful Malone, who she deems the meanest man in the world. The story affects all the townsfolk and reaches a national audience, Jane having both supporters and detractors. But both Jane and Malone will do whatever they can to beat the other, both who see the fight as a matter of principle. Meanwhile, New York based reporter Larry Hall, in Cape Anne to cover the story, falls for Jane. This move does not sit well with George Denham, who is Jane's childhood friend, lawyer and wannabe suitor.\"\n\nOriginally released July 14, 1959 under the title \"It Happened to Jane\", this Kovacs vehicle again paired Ernie with his best friend Jack Lemmon.  It was the third and final consecutive movie that was directed by Richard Quine which also co-starred Ernie Kovacs. The film starred \"America's sweatheart\" Doris Day. Also featured was actor Steve Forest, who in reality is the brother of the late actor Dana Andrews. Kovacs' character of Harry Foster Malone was a thinly veiled immitation of Orson Wells' fictional Charles Foster Kane...who in turn was a thinly veiled immitation of the real publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst. Columbia Pictures apparently felt in 1961 that the film carried enough weight to warrant a reissue with the title \"Twinkle and Shine\". I have yet to exactly determine what Columbia's Publicity Department was referring to with the dialogue card \"A healthy (not sick, sick, sick) happy comedy\". After researching the top films for 1961, I can only reasonably assume that it was the controversial Stanley Kubrick black comedy, \"Lolita\".", "title": "Ernie Kovacs - Doris Day, Jack Lemmon - Trailer for \"Twinkle and Shine\" (\"It Happened to Jane\")", "publishedDate": "2011-01-03T19:31:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "0FtzjoMnAA8", "description": "The Aston Martin Zagato Centennial is a custom one-off realized by famous italian coachbuilder Zagato in order to celebrate 100 years of the british company and it's based off the Aston Martin DBS.\n\nSubscribe! http://bit.ly/SubscribeToMarchettino\n\nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/Marchettino \n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/MarchettinoYT\n\nGoogle+: http://google.com/+Marchettino", "title": "Aston Martin DBS Zagato Centennial", "publishedDate": "2014-05-27T10:00:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "0FuJJIacPOw", "description": "Downplaying his party's dismal performance in the polls, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal today (May 16) said it was a \"good start\", but admitted that it could have done better in the national capital, where it had emerged as the second largest party in Assembly election six months back. \"...This was our first (general) election.

Its absolutely true.  Sometimes you need to lie to patients about things they want to do or not much less now than in the past, because theyre more educated between CNN and the Internet.  The patients are more educated about what we do.\n\nNBC25 asked Dr. Hodari about the comments.   He said he was referring to life-threatening situations.\n\nNever tell a patient, especially a woman, youre going to die, he told NBC25.  And in that respect, yes, we lie.\n\nCaitlin Bruce, the patient who has filed suit against the doctor says his comments during the lecture dont surprise her.  She just hopes to send the message his actions are inappropriate, so it doesnt happen to others.\n\nYoure not God. You dont make other peoples decisions, she says she wants to tell him.  What you do to women, its not right.\n\nBruce went to Dr. Hodaris Flint clinic, the Feminine Health Care Clinic on Saginaw Road for an abortion.  He also owns several other southeastern Michigan clinics. She says she changed her mind as he started the procedure, but he wouldnt stop.\n\nDr. Hodari says she asked too late. \n\nBruces attorney, Tom R. Pabst, says all patients have the right to back out of a medical procedure at any time, and this video is evidence the doctor doesn't respect their basic rights.  \n\n\"Whether it's a sexual advance or a medical procedure, if she says, No, stop, that's the end of it,\" says Pabst.\n\nhttp://www.connectmidmichigan.com/news/story.aspx?id=461445\n\nSee Part I video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B9MbkAnqZ0", "title": "NBC investigation of late-term abortionist who says he has \"license to lie\"", "publishedDate": "2010-05-26T09:31:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "0G1NQrAOWFw", "description": "Dry mouth (xerostomia) is a condition in which saliva secretion is reduced, resulting not only in a dry mouth sensation, thirst and difficulty with eating, but also disturbed taste, periodontal disease, cavities and oral pain.
