Es una regi\u00f3n con un clima que var\u00eda desde templado, g\u00e9lido, subh\u00famedo hasta semi\u00e1rido. Y constituye el 28,1 % del territorio peruano.\n \nAccidentado relieve\n \nSe extiende entre picos, nevados y abruptas cimas. Posee una gran variedad de valles, lagos y pampas. Por lo que cuenta con un accidentado relieve y un variado clima. Sus destacadas formas de relieve son:\n \n\u2013Los valles interandinos: Llanuras que se ubican entre las monta\u00f1as. Ejemplo: Valle del Mantaro. \n \n\u2013Las mesetas: Llanuras que se ubican a gran altitud. Ejemplo: Meseta de Bomb\u00f3m (Cerro de Pasco). \n \n\u2013Ca\u00f1ones fluviales: Son cortes estrechos y profundos que los r\u00edos han efectuado al atravesar las monta\u00f1as cordilleranas. Ejemplo: Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del Colca, en Arequipa. \n \n\u2013Las monta\u00f1as: Son grandes elevaciones de terreno que pasan de los 5 mil metros de altitud. Cuando presentan hielo en la cumbre, se les llama nevados. Ejemplo: Nevado de Yerupaja (ubicado en los l\u00edmites de Ancash, Hu\u00e1nuco y Lima). \n \n\u2013Los lagos y lagunas: Son grandes masas de agua que se depositan en depresiones del terreno. Ejemplo: Lago Titicaca. El clima de la sierra es m\u00e1s fr\u00edo en las zonas altas y templado en las zonas bajas.\n \nActividades \n \nEn la sierra peruana hay una variada actividad econ\u00f3mica, representada por: \n \n\u2013La agricultura: Se cultivan productos para el consumo directo como la papa, la quinua, el trigo, etc. \n \n\u2013La ganader\u00eda: Se cr\u00edan vacunos en Cajamarca, Arequipa, Jun\u00edn; ovinos en el centro sur y cam\u00e9lidos en las zonas m\u00e1s altas. \n \n\u2013La miner\u00eda: Actividad de la cual se extrae oro, plata, cobre, plomo y zinc. \n \nCiudades principales\n \nEntre ellas, est\u00e1n Ayacucho, Arequipa, Cajamarca, Cerro de Pasco, Cusco, Jun\u00edn, Huaraz, Huancayo, Hu\u00e1nuco y Puno, entre otros.", "title": "Proyecto: Esta es mi sierra", "publishedDate": "2014-08-16T22:08:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "0_2j9D9rpgw", "description": "", "title": "Mr. Pig 5-09-2010 JT tuffo sul pubblico e rischio craniata!", "publishedDate": "2010-12-28T11:01:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "0_2uxLA9CJI", "description": "VARIATION IN ARTIODACTYLS 2", "title": "PLJOURNAL11: VARIATION IN ARTIODACTYLS 2", "publishedDate": "2012-06-06T02:54:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "0_30u_7KOAo", "description": "An authentic ancient Greek hairstyle reconstructed from ancient sculpture.\n\nMusical Background (\"Aphrodite\", ISRC QM-UDL-11-00010) was created by Janet Stephens, jntvstp, using Apple Garageband.", "title": "\"Aphrodite knot\"", "publishedDate": "2011-02-01T00:15:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "0_35146K1rg", "description": "Slowed-rotor technology, an aviation concept developed and demonstrated by Carter Aviation Technologies, eliminates drag in a rotorcraft, allowing the aircraft to fly as fast as a fixed-wing airplane.\n\nFrom: INCREDIBLE FLYING CARS: Vertical Takeoff\nhttp://bit.ly/UHcKfU", "title": "A Remarkable Innovation in Aviation Design", "publishedDate": "2013-10-07T15:19:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "0_3emsneYQA", "description": "Off Broadway\nBad Indication\nLive @ the 4th of July Fest 2002 in Palatine IL.

They play a vital role in urinary system and it maintains homeostatic functions in our body. Kidneys regulate the electrolytes, maintenance of acid-base balance and regulation of blood pressure( i.e salt \u2013water balance) . They serve the body as a natural filter of the food and remove wastes which are diverted in to the urinary bladder. In producing urine, the kidneys excrete wastes such as urea and ammonium. The kidneys also responsible for the reabsorption of water, glucose & aminoacids. The kidneys also produce hormones including calcitrol, rennin & erythropoietin.\nWHAT IS A KIDNEY STONE :  It is a small stone , usually made up of calcium crystals, that forms inside the part of the kidney, where urine collects. The stone usually causes little problem until it falls into the ureter, the tube that drains the kidney in to the bladder, and causes an obstruction, preventing urine from draining out of the kidney  and often causing severe pain.\n\nA  variety of minerals and chemicals are excreated in the urine and sometimes these combine to form the beginning of a stone.over time, this can grow from an invisible speck of sand in to a stone that can be an inch in diameter or larger.\nThere are different terms for kidneys stones depending up on where they located with in the urinary tract:\n\nUrolith: A stone any where within the urinary tract\n\nNephrolith: A stone with in the kidney\n\nUreterolith: A stone with in the ureter\n\nCalculus: A stone with in the body\n\nWHAT CAUSES KIDNEY STONES :\n\nThere are certain  reasons to form kidney stones in some people and not others. Acid-base inbalance is one of the reason to kidney stone formation and Thyroid and Parathyroid irregular function create poor absorption of calicium in the body. So that extra deposition of calcium settled as a stone in the kidneys. Dehydration, especially patients who do not drink enough fluids also cause for kidney stone formation. Calicium oxalate is the most common type of kidney stone. Less frequently, uric acid can cause stones.  Xanthine, Struvite and other types of stones are rare. Some stones are combinations of these minerals and chemicals. Intake of high vitamin D also a factor to increase calcium stones in kidneys.   High Calcium through supplements (not for dietary) in diet may increase the number of stones formed. \n\nSYMPTOMS OF KIDNEY STONES: \n\n When the stones move through urinary tract, they may cause:\n\n\uf0fc Pain in back and belly\n\uf0fc Frequent or painful urination\n\uf0fc Nausea and vomiting\n\uf0fc Blood in the urine\n\nNADIPATHY TREATMENT FOR KIDNEY STONES:\n\n Many of the treatments are available to cure kidney stones. But they are giving unnecessary medicines to internal body to passage the stones. It will need much time as weeks (or) months.  Sometimes they are doing harmful surgeries to remove the kidney stones. This will cause side effects to kidney. \n\nNadipathy introduced a special treatment first time in the world to remove kidney stones without using any medicines and surgeries. By using acupuncture, acupressure, marma therapy, Vedic therapy, magnet therapy, seed therapy, beach sand therapy, and some other natural therapies we remove the kidney stones safely with 0% side effects. The stones come out from bladder within 30 minutes. Sometimes based up on size of the stones, it needs to remove with 2 \u2013 5 treatments. Once the problem is cured with our treatment, the stone does not appear in their lifetime.  It is the safe treatment who needs to cure the kidney stone problem.\n\nFor more information please log on to:\n\nwww.nadipathy.in\n\nhttp://kidneystonestreatmentinnadipathy.blogspot.in/\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYxb4HnTMmEA_oxd0TYnIyzMKajS7q-O\n\nNADIPATHY  KIDNEY STONES  TRATMENT CENTERS\n\n1: KAKINADA\nContact No: 0884-6459111\n\n2: HYDERABAD\nContact No: 040-65459111", "title": "Kidney stones removed in just 30 minutes treatment of Nadipathy", "publishedDate": "2014-06-26T13:12:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "0_987GVtwVo", "description": "Como siempre, feliz de compartir con todos las cosas que he aprendido y que con un poco de imaginaci\u00f3n ustedes pueden adaptar a su decoraci\u00f3n y uso.

Surely no fish could catch you there... unless that fish is the indefatigable slingjaw wrasse!\n\nThe slingjaw wrasse gets its name from its amazingly extendable jaws, which can reach out more than half the wrasse's total body length to snap up prey like small fish and crustaceans. They are able to pull this incredible stunt because their jaws are not firmly attached to the rest of their skull.

To open, face the tip of the telescoping rods outwards, and quickly swing the collapsed baton into play. To collapse and store the baton, force the tip into any solid surface. \n\nFor easy adjustment of the force needed to open the baton, a retaining pin is found in the cap at the butt of the handle. \n\nTo lessen friction, separate the two pins.... and to add friction, press them together.\n\nA solid, weighted tip at the end of the baton maximizes the potential of every strike, allowing powerful, yet surprisingly quick motions...and the rubberized TPE handle makes for a rugged, comfortable grip...in all situations.\n\nDesigned for law enforcement, security and self defense - Crafted from premium materials... and built for a lifetime...\n\nThis is the SCBAT21 Professional Series, Telescoping Baton.\n\n\n\nLike Us on Facebook:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/Schrade-Facebook\n\nFollow Us Twitter: \nhttps://twitter.com/SchradeKnives\n\nVisit http://schrade.com/ for Gear News, Tips and New Releases...\n\n___________\n\nHere's a Few More Links of Our NEW Product Videos:\n\nSchrade SCHA6LBR Assisted Opening Knife:\nhttp://youtu.be/DVJf2NWssNQ\n\nLegendary Uncle Henry 897UH Premium Stock Pocket Knife:\nhttp://youtu.be/txOGfiPyvPk\n\nSchrade SCH102 Folding Knife:\nhttp://youtu.be/Fb8KwoQP6OQ\n\nLegendary Old Timer 152OT Sharpfinger Knife:\nhttp://youtu.be/eaiHIUnX2n0\n\nSchrade Compact Fixed Blade, Multi-Carry Knife: SCHF16\nhttp://youtu.be/uLp3V8o6c1I\n\nUncle Henry 153UH Golden Spike Knife:\nhttp://youtu.be/IkM3-89s47Q\n\n____________\n\nReviews by Others:\n\nSchrade Extreme Survival Knife Review - by Ultimate Survival Tips:\nhttp://youtu.be/CPFyyJTNWUE\n\nSchrade Survival Bolo Knife Review - by Ultimate Survival Tips:\nhttp://youtu.be/C0MjdQ4_Hg8\n\nSchrade Extreme Survival Knife SCHF9 Review  by\nUltimate Survival Tips: http://youtu.be/g_B0SRsP_ag\nOther Review: http://youtu.be/Z76cUMruE_U\n\n____________\n\nThanks for Stopping By...\n\nThe Schrade Team:\nhttp://youtu.be/0_RJkBkN2iY", "title": "NEW!

Nevertheless, because of the Moorish occupation of the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages, and the participation of Portugal in the Age of Discovery, it has adopted loanwords from all over the world.\nVery few Portuguese words can be traced to the pre-Roman inhabitants of Portugal, which included the Gallaeci, Lusitanians, Celtici and Cynetes. The Phoenicians and Carthaginians, briefly present, also left some scarce traces. Some notable examples are ab\u00f3bora \"pumpkin\" and bezerro \"year-old calf\", from the nearby Celtiberian language (probably through the Celtici); cerveja \"beer\", from Celtic; through Latin \"cervisia.\"\nIn the 5th century, the Iberian Peninsula (the Roman Hispania) was conquered by the Germanic Suebi and Visigoths. As they adopted the Roman civilization and language, however, these people contributed only a few words to the lexicon, mostly related to warfare\u2014such as espora \"spur\", estaca \"stake\", and guerra \"war\", from Gothic *spa\u00fara, *stakka, and *wirro, respectively. The influence also exists in toponymic surnames and patronymic surnames borne by Visigoth sovereigns and their descendants, and it dwells on placenames such has Ermesinde, Esposende and Resende where sinde and sende are derived from the Germanic \"sinths\" (military expedition) and in the case of Resende, the prefix re comes from Germanic \"reths\" (council).\nBetween the 9th and 13th centuries, Portuguese acquired about 900 words from Arabic by influence of Moorish Iberia. They are often recognizable by the initial Arabic article a(l)-, and include many common words such as aldeia \"village\" from \u0627\u0644\u0636\u064a\u0639\u0629 al\u1e0dai`a (or from Edictum Rothari: aldii, aldias),[80] alface \"lettuce\" from \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0633 alkhass, armaz\u00e9m \"warehouse\" from \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u0632\u0646 almakhzan, and azeite \"olive oil\" from \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a azzait. From Arabic came also the grammatically peculiar word oxal\u00e1 \u0625\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \"hopefully\". The Mozambican currency name metical was derived from the word \u0645\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644 mitq\u0101l, a unit of weight. The word Mozambique itself is from the Arabic name of sultan Mu\u00e7a Alebique (Musa Alibiki).\nStarting in the 15th century, the Portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from Asian languages. For instance, catana \"cutlass\" from Japanese katana and ch\u00e1 \"tea\" from Chinese ch\u00e1.\nFrom South America came batata \"potato\", from Taino; anan\u00e1s and abacaxi, from Tupi--Guarani nan\u00e1 and Tupi ib\u00e1 cati, respectively (two species of pineapple), and tucano \"toucan\" from Guarani tucan.\n\nPortuguese language schools\nPortuguese language software\nPortuguese language training\nPortuguese lesson\nPortuguese lessons\nPortuguese names\nPortuguese online\nPortuguese phrases\nPortuguese school\nPortuguese software\nPortuguese translate\nPortuguese translation\nPortuguese translations\nPortuguese translator\nPortuguese tutor\nPortuguese vocabulary\nPortuguese words\nPortuguese writing\nlearn basic Portuguese\nlearn how to speak Portuguese\nlearn Portuguese\nstudy Portuguese\nstudy Portuguese language\nteach me Portuguese", "title": "how to learn speaking Portuguese language", "publishedDate": "2013-12-14T11:12:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "0_SOjs0dMl0", "description": "God bless guys jojo from oz xxxx\nhttp://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/earthquake-riddle-spectacular-drone-footage-4084858", "title": "GIANT FISSURE MEXICO IS LEGIT", "publishedDate": "2014-08-22T03:28:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "0_SXp9BZIRE", "description": "Alg\u00e9rie - C\u00f4te d'Ivoire | CAN Orange 2013 | 30.01.2013\n\nAlg\u00e9rie  2-2 C\u00f4te d'Ivoire | R\u00e9sum\u00e9 du match - Group D\nAlgeria 2-2 C\u00f4te d'Ivoire| Match highlights - Groupe D\nCoupe d'Afrique des Nations Orange, AFRIQUE DU SUD 2013\nMatchday 3 - 30/01/2013 - Royal Bafokeng Stadium, Rustenburg \nStrikers : Feghouli (ALG) 64', Soudani (ALG) 70', Drogba (CIV) 77', Bony (CIV) 81'\n\nFor more videos of the Orange AFCON 2013, visit : http://youtube.com/myafricanfootball\nDownload Orange AFCON 2013 application for iOS: http://bit.ly/TXvx3o\nDownload Orange AFCON2013 application for Android : http://bit.ly/V6Eydo\nOrange AFCON 2013 on Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/AfricaCupOfNationsOfficial\nFollow us on Twitter : https://twitter.com/caf_online", "title": "Alg\u00e9rie - C\u00f4te d'Ivoire | CAN Orange 2013 | 30.01.2013", "publishedDate": "2013-01-30T23:02:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "0_SmOG_4yWo", "description": "Universe Sandbox Heliocentric vs Geocentric", "title": "Universe Sandbox Heliocentric vs Geocentric", "publishedDate": "2014-01-06T07:29:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "0_Sy9yQDiNQ", "description": "Nottingham Contemporary Dance Company devising in July.", "title": "NCDC Damian's dance - section 2: K&A original duo choreography", "publishedDate": "2013-07-11T14:52:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "0_TDvEJWie0", "description": "GTA 5 NEW Rare PS4 & Xbox One Car Prices - Cheval Monster Truck, Dukes, Stallion & MORE!

In 2008, the IUCN classified the species as Least Concern as it is tolerant of a broad range of habitats. It is widely distributed with large populations that in 2008 were thought unlikely to be declining. In 2012, it was suggested that recent increases in capturing the animals for Kopi Luwak production may constitute a significant threat to wild civet populations.\n\nThe Asian palm civet is a small, mottled gray and black viverrid weighing 2 to 5 kg (4.4 to 11.0 lb). It has a body length of about 53 cm (21 in) with a 48 cm (19 in) long tail. Its long, stocky body is covered with coarse, shaggy hair that is usually greyish in color. There is a white mask across the forehead, a small white patch under each eye, a white spot on each side of the nostrils, and a narrow dark line between the eyes. The muzzle, ears, lower legs, and distal half of the tail are black, with three rows of black markings on the body. The tail is without rings, unlike in similar civet species. Anal scent glands emit a nauseating secretion as a chemical defense when threatened or upset. Despite its species name hermaphroditus, the civets (like all other mammals) have two distinct sexes and are not hermaphrodites.\n\nAsian palm civets are native to India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Singapore, Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei Darussalam, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Philippines and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Bawean and Siberut. They were introduced to Irian Jaya, the Lesser Sunda Islands, Maluku, Sulawesi and Japan. In Papua New Guinea, their presence is uncertain.\n\nThey normally inhabit primary forests, but also occur at lower densities in secondary and selectively logged forest.\n\nAsian palm civets are omnivores utilizing fruits such as berries and pulpy fruits as a major food source, and thus help to maintain tropical forest ecosystems via seed dispersal. They eat chiku, mango, rambutan and coffee, but also small mammals and insects.\n\nsource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Exhaustive legal research from both state and national archives documented conclusively that the amendment did not even come close to being legally approved by the required number of states.\n\nThe Courts have refused to hear this issue.\n\n\"[Defendant] Stahl's claim that ratification of the 16th Amendment was fraudulently certified constitutes a political question because we could not undertake independent resolution of this issue without expressing lack of respect due coordinate branches of government....\"\n\nU.S. v Stahl (1986), 792 F2d 1438\n\n2) Filing a federal income tax return is, in fact, voluntary, because there is no statute or regulation that requires the vast majority of U.S. citizens to file and pay income taxes -- or to have taxes withheld from the money they earn.\n\nNeither the IRS nor the Congress can cite an authorizing law or regulation.\n\n3) Citizens cannot \"voluntarily\" file a federal income tax return without surrendering their 5th amendment right not to bear witness against themselves.\n\nYou can be criminally prosecuted for your \"voluntary\" return.\n\nRobert Schulz, chairman of the Foundation, and Joseph Banister, a former special agent of the Criminal Investigation Division of the IRS (accompanied by a videographer) delivered copies of the Remonstrance to designated officials of the three branches.\n\nAt the White House and the Capitol, the delegates had the opportunity to explain and discuss the contents of the Remonstrance, and to ask that the government send experts representing the three branches to a conference to be held in June, where those experts could debate the tax issues with a group of researchers invited by the Foundation.\n\nThe officials agreed to the idea of having such a conference, and the Foundation scheduled the meeting for June 29th.\n\n4 more Info \nhttp://www.givemeliberty.org/features/taxes/usatoday.htm", "title": "IRS Agents Says : $50,000 reward to show a law requiring to pay federal Income tax", "publishedDate": "2012-07-18T05:01:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "0a-P32X1eqU", "description": "The Islamic State has released a video claiming to show the beheading of British captive David Haines.\nIn the video, titled A Message to the Allies of America, the extremists also threaten to execute another Briton.\n\nThe man kneeling in the video says: 'My name is David Cawthorne Haines. I would like to declare that I hold you David Cameron entirely responsible for my execution.\n\n'You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor Tony Blair did, following a trend amongst our British Prime Minsters who can't find the courage to say no to the Americans.\n'Unfortunately it is we the British public that in the end will pay the price for our Parliament's selfish decisions.'\n\nThe Islamic State militant, who has a British accent, adds: 'This British man has to the pay the price for your promise Cameron to arm the Peshmerga against the Islamic State. \n\n'Ironically he has spent a decade of his life serving under the same Royal Air Force that is responsible for delivering those arms.\n\nYour evil alliance with America which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha Dam will only accelerate your destruction, and playing the role of the obedient lapdog, Cameron, will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war.'\n\nThe footage then shows what is believed to be the body of Mr Haines.\n\nAnother hostage, believed to be British, is then paraded.\n\nThe militant adds: 'If you, Cameron, persist in fighting the Islamic State then you like your master Obama, will have the blood of your people on your hands.' \n\nThe Foreign Office said tonight it was 'working urgently to verify' the video, which was removed from Youtube within minutes.", "title": "Islamic State extremist show beheading of British captive David Haines", "publishedDate": "2014-09-13T23:06:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "0a-RXyuE4aM", "description": "From the album Poems For New Orleans, available on Paris Records\nhttp://www.parisrecords.net/\n\nEd Sanders\nWith music composed and arranged by Mark Bingham\n\nProduced by\nMichael Minzer & Mark Bingham\n\nPlayers:\nJames Alsanders -- bicycle spokes, paella pan, cast iron skillet, cowbell, \ntambourine, GoBo\nSusan Cowsill -- vocal", "title": "Ed Sanders - Unearned Suffering", "publishedDate": "2013-04-03T16:26:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "0a031AVQHz0", "description": "We don't have 'em in the US, but mud crabs are standard in Queensland, Australian - and they're good - but a ton of work to eat!

Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions \u2013 Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley\u2019s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.\n\nThe Movieclips Trailers channel is your destination for the hottest new trailers the second they drop.

It is the first report of British ground troops in action in the region and comes after Prime Minister David Cameron said there would be no UK \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in a combat role. Two SAS troopers spotted the Islamic State convoy from a hillside \u00adobservation point in northern Iraq.\n\nThe elite troops feared the fighters were planning to target vulnerable civilians in a nearby village. They tried to call in an airstrike but no jets were in the area. Instead, the SAS pair blasted the lead vehicle with a single round from their AW50 rifle fitted with a silencer. The weapon fires the same huge bullet as a heavy machine gun and can cut a man in half from more than a mile away.\n\nThe first shot hit the truck\u2019s engine and split it in two. The confused IS thugs jumped down from the open top vehicle and radioed for another so that they could continue their advance. When the insurgents climbed into the second lorry, the SAS team fired a second shot, destroying that too. The fanatics then realised they were under attack and fled in their remaining \u00advehicles. A senior source last night told: \u201cIt was a classic special forces operation. The SAS sniping team didn\u2019t want to engage the IS militants in a full-blown battle because they were part of a small patrol spread out over an area. But they knew they could not just let the convoy pass and start killing people in the villages. So rather than hitting the militants they destroyed their vehicles.\n\nThe jihadis had no idea who was firing at them or from where. \"They couldn\u2019t even hear the shot. They panicked and basically ran away. \"It\u2019s not always about killing the enemy but neutralising the threat that\u2019s what these guys did.\u201d", "title": "SAS Team Halt Islamic State Attack In Iraq With Just TWO Shots!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T19:08:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "0aIDP1J_Skg", "description": "White Bark Pine", "title": "White Bark Pine as Indicator", "publishedDate": "2008-12-04T20:57:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "0aJelIKDxbc", "description": "Co za PREMIERA!!

We took this theme and interpreted it to fit our tale of forsaken toys as the broken trust resulting from the hand that chooses to abandon you. After all, nothing is forever. \n\n\u272f Story \u272f (Based on the Velveteen Rabbit)\nShe was excited, the little girl. Her mother had finally gotten around to taking her to the toy store, the same one she\u2019d always glance at on the bus ride to school. See, there was something very special she had her eye on. \n\n There was a lightly colored, earthy brown rabbit with fabric tied around his neck that made him look elegant. She could see him every time she looked at the store; he was never taken. Even now, she could feel his gaze, begging to be taken home. It was almost like a puppy at the pound. \n\nBut none of that mattered now. She would soon have this rabbit as her friend. \n\nAs the years went on, she grew up loving the rabbit, but then things started to change. Everything started to shift. Her parents grew distant and argued increasingly more with each passing day. The feelings of her childhood were no more and in a flash, she tossed the rabbit aside. She had to grow up, and there was no place for the rabbit in her new world. \n\n\u201cI want to be by your side again...\u201d\n\n\u272f Credits \u272f\nMusic/Lyrics\u2729Daiki Ogawa @GurenHimawari (mylist/30412640)\nDrum\u2729Takuto Yamachika @TakutoYamatika (mylist/29200656)\nOriginal Illustration\u2729 Miyurica (\u307f\u3086\u308a\u304b) @Yurica_xx (user/27873657)\nOriginal Video\u2729Bibi (\u3073\u3073) @bibian0115 (mylist/34845701)\nEnglish Translation\u2729Coleena\u2729https://www.youtube.com/user/917802  \n\n\u272fArt\u272f\nShio\u2729http://equois.deviantart.com/\nLui\u2729http://lui-ysia.deviantart.com/\nEma\u2729https://www.youtube.com/user/Emaleign\nJurie\nAida\nIu\n\n\u272fMix\u272f\nTune\u2729Nao\u2729https://www.youtube.com/user/SsNao2\nTime\u2729Aida\nMix\u2729Ake\n\n\u272fAnimation\u272f\nSammi\u2729https://www.youtube.com/user/HKttyCatz\nEma\nIu\n\n\u272fStory and Storyboard\u272f\nMiyu\nAke\n\n\u272fScript\u272f\nhttp://tinyurl.com/ox385pp \n\n\u272fMP3\u272f\nhttps://app.box.com/s/b3dahdgj5266oqfky1gy\n\n\u272fA Capella\u272f\nhttps://app.box.com/s/gt8g7wlaqsfzjhk5q9bj \n\n\u272fVocalists\u272f\nSky\u2729http://www.nicovideo.jp/mylist/34866562\nPhi\u2729https://www.youtube.com/user/AikoAiko10\nJurie\u2729https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHtJDRHNIP7aMnolJdRd9w\nAke\u2729https://www.youtube.com/user/VocaloidAkeya\nMiyu~chi(stand-in)\u2729https://www.youtube.com/user/AgehaShirayuki\nIu\u2729https://www.youtube.com/user/iupiukyun\nAida\u2729https://www.youtube.com/user/AidaChan246", "title": "\u3010FCCB-R1\u3011 \u4eca\u65e5\u3001\u660e\u5f8c\u65e5\u3001\u3044\u3064\u3060\u3063\u3066/Today, The Day After Tomorrow, Anytime\u3010Velveteen\u3011", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T03:48:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "0aQ7ewnElvw", "description": "Idol Sverige i TV4 fr\u00e5n 2014-08-18: Idol-audition: Se Gustav Blomberg framf\u00f6ra l\u00e5ten I don't want to be till Idol-juryn i Stockholm.\n\nSwedish idol.\n\nMer fr\u00e5n Idol Sverige p\u00e5 YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/TV4IdolSweden?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSucc\u00e9programmet Idol, med en musikbranschkunnig jury i spetsen, ger sig ut p\u00e5 jakt efter Sveriges n\u00e4sta popstj\u00e4rna.\nhttp://www.tv4.se/idol", "title": "Gustav Blomberg - I don't want to be (hela audition) - Idol Sverige (TV4)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-18T18:45:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "0aQcjvclg4c", "description": "Chansons de la guerre 1914-1918 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e par la chorale de Griselles", "title": "Guerre de 1914-1918 - La Perm   Lettre d'un poilu 1915", "publishedDate": "2014-09-18T05:51:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "0aQxCWm-cq0", "description": "The Upsides live At 40/8 club 1/13/12", "title": "Twenty Years", "publishedDate": "2013-01-14T23:57:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "0aRezCCX0H4", "description": "Grupa Playbox,Zoran Kesic(klavijatura i vokal) i Sanja Vasiljevic (vokal).\nkontakt: 064 370 65 95\nwww.grupaplaybox.com\n\nKes bend,jutarnji program Happy Tv:Zoran Kesic,Scepan Sinanovic,Sanja Vasiljevic :)) 13.11.2010.", "title": "Playbox-Cija si nisi - Amadeus bend -Kes Bend", "publishedDate": "2010-11-16T20:57:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "0aRx6btsWcI", "description": "You can stop the cold draft around your door with this quick door insulation trick.

It is also known under the designations MP 43 and MP 44 (Maschinenpistole 43, Maschinenpistole 44 respectively). The StG 44 was the first successful weapon of its class, and the concept had a major impact on modern infantry small arms development. By all accounts, the StG 44 fulfilled its role admirably, particularly on the Eastern Front, offering a greatly increased volume of fire compared to standard infantry rifles and greater range than submachine guns. In the end, it came too late to have a significant effect on the outcome of the war. - info - Wikipedia  - No copyright infringement intended, I do not own this music or I don't take credit for this music.

Calling all strawberry lovers! Give classic shortbread cookies a twist with a double dose of delightful strawberries baked right into the cookies themselves and atop the cookies in a homemade glaze. Start out with 2 tablespoons of strawberry preserves in a large bowl. If there are any large chunks of strawberries, cut them into smaller pieces using kitchen shears. Add 1 cup of softened butter and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. Beat these ingredients with an electric mixer on medium. Place this key aspect to creating strawberry cookies onto plastic wrap and form it into a 6-inch log. Freeze the log until it's firm, which should take between one and two hours. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees when the log is almost frozen. In a large bowl with 2-2/3 cups of all-purpose flour, add 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/8 teaspoon of salt and mix together. Cut the butter log for these easy shortbread cookies into smaller pieces and cut them into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter until fine crumbs form and start to stick together. Knead the homemade cookies dough until it's smooth. Shape this into a ball. Cut it in half, rolling one half of the dough out to 1/4-inch thickness on a floured work surface. Cut out square or round shortbread cookies with a 1 1/2- to 2-inch scalloped cookie cutter, continuously rolling leftover dough. Place the cookies from scratch 1 inch apart from one another on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake until the edges just begin to brown, about 12 to 14 minutes per batch. Move these easy cookies to a wire rack to cool completely, during which time you can make the strawberry glaze. Put 1 tablespoon of strawberry preserves into a microwave set at 50 percent power for 30 seconds to melt it slightly and add it to a medium bowl. Whisk in 2 cups of powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon of milk for an irresistible addition to this shortbread cookies recipe. Continue whisking in milk as needed until a drizzling consistency forms. Spread or drizzle over the cookies once they've cooled, and for an even sweeter twist, dust the tops with coarse sugar. Make sure the glaze has completely hardened before you begin packing away these cookies recipes. Enjoy these sweet treats even when strawberries aren't in season by freezing these shortbread cookies for up to three months!\n\nSubscribe to the BHG Channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=bhg\n\nWatch more Cooking Basics videos: http://www.bhg.com/topics/cooking-basics.htm?showVideo=true\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.bhg.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mybhg\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/bhg\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/bhg/\nGooglePlus: https://plus.google.com/114700401799581477045/posts\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/betterhomesandgardens#", "title": "Strawberry Shortbread Cookies with a Colorful Strawberry Glaze", "publishedDate": "2014-05-02T13:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "0b7Fp2jQsng", "description": "- http://michaelmcfmusic.com/\n- http://facebook.com/michaelmcfmusic/\n\nTouring Motorcycle Luggage - Triumph Bonneville Tank Bag, Saddlebags - From the Mind of McFarland video blog.\n\nI've returned safely from my second of two motorcycle tours on my 2008 Triumph Bonneville (in Claret, which I'm pretty sure is a fancy word for \"red wine-colored\"), the first covering the North East United States (4500 miles, 24 days, 20 shows), the second the midwest (3500 miles, 20 days, 13 shows), for a total of 8000 miles in total. I'm on the edge of needing new tires, my butt is sore, and my back hurts, but all of the planning and preparation that went into making this journey on a touring motorcycle - or rather, turning a standard, stock bike into a good touring motorcycle - paid off. A lot of that came in the process of selecting the right motorcycle luggage - tank bag saddlebags, tailbag - and making other modifications to my Bonneville to make it more road worthy.\n\nLet me give you a rundown of everything I've got on the bike.\n\nFirst, up front I installed a National Cycle Plexifairing GT, which, while a substantial windscreen that take most of the wind pressure off of me when going at freeway speeds, as it is fully transparent, doesn't massively change the look. Even better, it attaches with two big-ol' nuts on the handlebar that can be loosened by hand, and two small wing nuts on the forks. In other words, it takes about 30 seconds to remove if I want the wind in my face for rides near home (which is Asheville, NC - there are a lot of great roads there!)\n\nI've also added Newbonneville.com's BillyBars to the front, which are highway cruising pegs. Having the ability to stretch out my legs is priceless.\n\nOn the gas tank is a Rapid Transit magnetic tank bag, which is where I carry my pedals, cables, wallet, that sort of stuff.\n\nMy saddlebags are soft-side - I use one for my tools, the other for my food.\n\nThe real star of the show, though, is my MotoFizz Camping Seat Bag (size large), which is huge and awesome. Since I keep my merchandise case - which is rigid - in this bag, it holds its shape well enough that I can cantilever it off the back, otherwise it's probably best to keep it on the seat and not on a rack.\n\nSo that's what I've done as far as my touring motorcycle luggage, and it all worked swimmingly!\n\n-MMcF\n----------------------\nUnleaded rhythmic alt-pop fuels singer/songwriter and two-wheel troubadour Michael McFarland's engine.

So don\u2019t just assume it\u2019s only the potassium.\n\nPotassium Bicarbonate: I\u2019ve taken it for 10 years\n\nPotassium Bicarbonate work perfectly to lower my blood pressure by roughy 20 points to 121/72 mm Hg\n\nI have taken potassium bicarbonate since 2000 for blood pressure, and my blood pressure dropped roughly 20 points to 121/72 mm Hg.\n\nPotassium Intake Through Human History\n\nFor millions of years, we consumed a lot more potassium, a lot more bicarbonate, a lot less sodium, and a lot less chloride\n\nFor millions of years, we consumed a lot more potassium, a lot more bicarbonate, a lot less sodium, and a lot less chloride.\n\nPotassium Bicarbonate: Other Benefits\n\nPotassium Bicarbonate reduces risk of osteoporosis, reduces loss of muscle, attenuates reduction in growth hormone with aging\n\nPotassium bicarbonate has been shown to have many benefits including: - a decrease in bone loss - a decrease in muscle loss - an increase in growth hormone One paper also suggested the idea that increasing potassium intake might decrease the risk of cancer.\n\nConclusion\n\nConclusion: Potassium citrate reduces kidney stones\n\nThe authors of the study concluded, \u201cIn summary, our randomized trial showed the efficacy of potassium citrate in preventing new stone formation in idiopathic hypocitraturic calcium nephrolithiasis.\u201d\n\nREFERENCE\n\nBarcelo P, Wuhl O, Servitge E, Rousaud A, Pak C.

They were met in Glasgow by a man on a rickshaw playing the Imperial Death March from Star Wars, who then chased them down the street.\n\n\"People of Glasgow, this is your imperial masters,\" he shouted, persued by TV cameras and journalists. \"Say hello to your imperial masters. These lovely people, they have travelled all the way from England to tell us they are better to rule us than anybody else, our imperial masters. People of Glasgow your imperial masters have arrived.\"\n\nHe added in a Darth Vader singing voice: \"Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh duh, duuuuh.\"\n\nThe Labour figures targeted included shadow Northern Ireland secretary Ivan Lewis, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint and shadow cabinet office minister John Ashworth. Shadow equalities minister Kate Green was not impressed. \"Don't be silly,\" she told him as he and his driver cycled past.\n\nThe video was recorded and uploaded by Glasgow Scottish rebel Matt Lygate. \"It's official THE EMPIRE IS OVER!\" he said on Facebook.\n\nMore from the Press Association:\n\nSNP leaders will visit Scotland's seven cities while their Labour counterparts will rally support in Glasgow as both sides of the independence campaign continue to push for votes. With just six days to go until the referendum Alex Salmond and his deputy Nicola Sturgeon will campaign for a Yes vote in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling, Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness and Perth.\n\nLabour leader Ed Miliband will be joined by former prime minister Gordon Brown and Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont at a rally in Glasgow, as the party seeks to take the lead in building support for the No campaign. Ukip will also join the campaign trail, with the party expected to host its own rally in Glasgow attended by leader Nigel Farage and his MEPs.\n\nThe latest stage of campaigning comes as a new poll found the No campaign has moved back into a narrow lead. The latest YouGov survey of almost 1,300 people for The Times and The Sun puts support for No at 52%, slightly ahead of Yes at 48%, once undecided voters are factored out.\n\nToday, Mr Salmond will take to the skies visiting Aberdeen, Inverness and Dundee, while Ms Sturgeon will be starting in Glasgow where she will be campaigning in Drumchapel with actors Martin Compston and Peter Mullan. She will then move on to Edinburgh and Stirling.\n\nThe pair will later meet up alongside Yes activists in Perth for more campaigning. They plan to highlight what they argue are the seven key gains of independence, including job-creating powers, protection for the NHS, savings as a result of scrapping Trident, the SNP's \"transformational\" childcare, control of social security and the minimum wage, and \"always getting the governments we vote for\".\n\nMr Salmond said: \"A Yes vote is a golden opportunity for people in Scotland - to use that wealth and control policy so that many more people benefit. As the opportunities of independence have become clearer throughout this campaign, we have seen more and more people switch from No to Yes - and with this tour I'll be taking the positive case of seven key gains of independence directly to ordinary people in cities across the country.\n\n\"A Yes vote is the opportunity of a lifetime - the chance to take Scotland's future into Scotland's hands and to have confidence in our own ability to make a better future for the people of Scotland. The energy and confidence of the Yes campaign is energising people and communities across Scotland - and stands in stark contrast to the same old scaremongering from a distrusted and discredited Westminster establishment.\"\n\nLabour's latest rally comes after dozens of the senior figures from the party arrived north of the border on Thursday to help Mr Miliband shore up support. Ms Lamont will also attend a Better Together campaign event in Falkirk earlier in the day to \"make the case that being part of the UK keeps costs down for families in Scotland\".\n\nIt comes after retailers John Lewis warned that shoppers would be likely to face higher prices post-independence, and supermarket Asda said it would have to ''reflect its cost'' to operate north of the border after a Yes vote.", "title": "Scottish Independence: Darth Vader Music Chases Labour MPs Around Glasgow", "publishedDate": "2014-09-12T07:13:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "0bH3EdIdoGY", "description": "http://www.ReplicaAirguns.com - Umarex Walther P38 4.5mm CO2 Blowback BB Pistol Field Test Shooting Review.\n\n-Made by Umarex\n-4.5mm Steel BB\n-12 Gram CO2\n-20 Round Magazine\n-400 FPS\n-Blowback\n-Walther P38 Licensed Replica.\n-Available at: www.ReplicaAirguns.com\n\nHere is my official Field Test Shooting Video Review for my KWC M1911 Model A1 TAC CO2 Blowback BB Pistol. Interestingly enough, this time around I got a bit lower average feet per second rating from this air gun at right around 290 fps as compared to the pre-test I did during my Table Top Review (shot closer to 310 average fps)? Both days the temperature was about the same and the CO2 used on both occasions was the same brand and where unused. Just goes to show you that these guns sometimes have a mind of their own...\n\nAt least the accuracy portion came in just about the same with an approximate 2 inch grouping shooting at the target from 20 feet out in a semi rested position. I did shoot a bit to the left and a bit low which I could adjust form left to right but since there is only a windage adjustment I would have to sight a bit up to hit the bullseye with the KWC M1911 Model A1 TAC. This time around I also got 4 magazine worth of shots as I slowed things down a bit and took my time and juts like last time I had no problems or malfunctions with my KWC M1911 Model A1 TAC.\n\nThe best part about shooting the KWC M1911 Model A1 TAC CO2 Air Pistol is it's beautiful single action 1911 styled trigger and nice heavy full blowback action, making this gun a great economical trainer if you own the real steel version or perhaps just want to feel like you do! \n\nCheck out my Table Top Written Review with Photos on my website at:\nhttp://www.replicaairguns.com/posts/2013/2/1/umarex-walther-p38-co2-blowback-bb-pistol-table-top-review.html\n\nCheck out my full Field Test Written Post on my website at:\nhttp://www.replicaairguns.com/posts/2013/2/1/umarex-walther-p38-co2-blowback-bb-pistol-table-top-review.html\n\nBuy the Umarex Walther P38 Blowback 4.5mm BB Pistol in Canada:\nhttp://www.replicaairguns.com/buy-air-blank-guns/#!/~/product/category=722885&id=9129056\n\nBuy the Umarex Walther P38 Blowback 4.5mm BB Pistol in the US:\nhttp://www.replicaairguns.com/buy-air-blank-guns-us/#!/~/product/category=2215352&id=9316558", "title": "Umarex Walther P38 CO2 Blowback BB Pistol Field Test Shooting Review", "publishedDate": "2013-02-09T20:41:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "0bHPvrH4NLM", "description": "Adelanto del episodio \u201cLa Tercera es la Perdida\u201d.

Somali Muslims in Norway are abusing the system.\nSomali-Norweigans are having 4 kids each (statistical average), and single Moms collect welfare on each child each month.\n\nHowever, these kids did not lose their father,  rather the fathers are in many case still providing material support while the mothers scam the system out of taxpayers hard-earned money by pretending the father is not around, and the mothers are conceiving out of wedlock (post-divorce) year after year from the same man.  \n\nThis reeks of welfare fraud in which the couple gets divorced so the family can scam the government and taxpayers out of their hard-earned money -- but they continue their familial and sexual relationship,  in cohabitation or while living seperately to avoid getting caught.   The key here is that the women keep getting pregnant with the same father, this means she is not single and is defrauding the government as a money making scheme.\n\nAbout the title:  While this certaily does not reflect the values of all Muslims, Several Muslim lecturers throughout Europe have conveyed that it is not theft if you trick Kaffirs out of their money to lead an Islamic life because all Kaffir money belongs to Allah.

My name is Doug Patt.  And this is So You want to be an Architect?  A seven part series exploring the architect.  This is lesson two.  What does an architect make? On the surface this sounds like a dumb question.  An architect makes buildings.  But if you look below the surface youll see that the answer is much more meaningful. Ralph Waldo Emerson (who lived from 1803  1882), was a well-known writer, philosopher and poet.  He said of Greek architecture, it is the flowering of geometry.  Translated, Emerson was referring to the Greek architects elaboration and mastery of shape and form. Anne Louise Germaine de Stael (who lived from 1766  1817) is a little known Swiss author who lived in Paris and abroad.  She is quoted as saying architecture is frozen music.  In simple terms her comment means that architects make a kind of static harmony of sound.   Philip Schaff (who lived from 1819  1893) was a Swiss born, Protestant theologian.  He said, architecture is a handmaid of devotion, a beautiful church is a sermon in stone.   Elaborating a bit on Shaffs comment we can imply that architecture, like a sermon, is also a kind of message or story. And finally John Ruskin an author, poet and artist (who lived from 1819  1900) said of architecture that the mere sight of it,  may contribute to (his) mental health, power and pleasure.  In other words architecture is an Inspiration.  So, lets move beyond the specifics of what each person what referring to and draw some general conclusions.  In simple terms, these four individuals tell us then that an architect makes form, stories, music and inspiration.  So lets take a look at a couple examples of each.  When I think of architecture as shape or form I think of Frank Gehry, famous for pushing the limits of modern technology while creating monuments to modern engineering and form making.  Some examples of this are his museum in Bilboa, the Stata Center or his Disney concert hall.  When I think of architecture telling me a story I think of  Frank Lloyd wrights Guggenheim museum that tells a story from the outside about how one moves through the spiraling galleries on the inside.  Or the Pompidou center in Paris that tells a color-coded story from the outside about the mechanical inner workings that make this machine like building function on the inside. When I think of architecture as beautiful music I think of the buildings of Eero Saarinen whos work resembles naturally soaring forms as they strain to hit the high note or the way Frank Lloyd Wrights falling water harmoniously blends into nature and almost sings with the waterfall it sits above.  When I think of architecture as an inspiration I think of the great cathedrals of Europe & the US or the great skyscrapers of our cities.   So while some may think that architecture is just about making buildings you know that making architecture is about making much more than just a box with windows.  Its about making form, story, music and Inspiration. And that concludes the second part of our video series so you want to be an architect.  Im Doug Patt.

It produces hormones that work to keep our metabolic rate stable and keep energy-producing processes in balance. The thyroid is essential in protein synthesis, growth, temperature regulation, and oxygen consumption of cells.\n\nHypothyroidism is a health problem that occurs due to underactive thyroid gland. Due to hypothyroidism the metabolism rate of the body gets affected as metabolism is controlled mainly by the help of thyroid gland. \n\nSymptoms associated with hypothyroidism are fatigue, increased sensitivity to cold, constipation, dry skin, puffy face, hoarse voice, cramping of muscles, sudden weight gain, depression and brittle fingernails and hair.\n\nCauses for Hypothyroidism :\n\nSome causes of low thyroid besides inheritance are : iodine depletion, x-rays or low dose radiation, pituitary and thyroid malfunction, air and environmental pollutants, overuse of diet pills and other drugs, and vitamin A, E, and zinc deficiency. \n\nEat foods rich in vitamin A, such as yellow vegetables, eggs, carrots, and dark green vegetables. \n\nZinc and copper are important in helping the body make thyroid hormone. \nFoods rich in zinc are : beef, oatmeal, chicken, seafood, dried beans, bran,  spinach, seeds, and nuts. \n\nFoods rich in copper are : organ meats, eggs, yeast, legumes, nuts, and raisins.\n\nThe amino acid tyrosine is helpful. Tyrosine is found in beef, chicken, and fish. Soy should be only used in small amounts.\n\nMeditation and visualization using colour therapy may be helpful. Visualize a beautiful blue light and feel the colour into the thyroid area.\n\nAerobic exercise such as jumping or fast walking may enhance our nutritional program and help to strengthen the thyroid. \n\nEffect of Coconut Oils on Hypothyroidism :\n \nCoconut oil is saturated and very stable. Coconut oil does not require the enzyme stress that vegetable oils do, preventing T4 to T3 hormone conversion, not only because it is stable oil, but also because it is processed differently in the body and does not need to be broken down by enzyme dependent processes as do long chain fatty acids.   Eliminating long chain fatty acids from the diet and replacing them with medium chain fatty acids found in coconut oil can help in rebuilding cell membranes and increasing enzyme production that will assist in promoting the conversion of T4 to T3 hormones.\n\nThere are many natural remedies that can help in preventing, controlling and treating Hypothyroidism.\n\n1) Iodine : Iodine is essential to ensure proper functioning of thyroid gland. Some of natural sources of Iodine are yoghurt, fish, meat, eggs, seafood, potato, radish, bananas, oatmeal and salt.\n\n2) Ginger is a good source of zinc, magnesium and potassium and its powerful anti-inflammatory properties can help in improving the functionality of thyroid. Fresh ginger root slices can be added to soups and other dishes or used as ginger herbal tea. \n \n3) Coconut oil contains medium chain fatty acids which help in improving the functionality of thyroid. It also boosts the body metabolism rate. Coconut oil is a saturated fat that we can consume by adding it to milk. \n\n4)  Primrose oil is rich in amino acids which nourish the thyroid gland. This oil can help in improving the functionalities of thyroid gland and it also remove the problems associated with hypothyroidism such as hair loss and heavy menstrual flow.\n\n5) Black walnut is a good source of organic iodine. Black walnut which is also rich in magnesium helps in improving the functionality of thyroid gland.\n\n6) Flax seeds contain a good amount of omega 3 fatty acids which are essential for smooth functioning of the thyroid gland. Take a tablespoon of ground flaxseeds and have with water every day on empty stomach. \n\nFor proper functioning of thyroid gland, it is important to expose your body for twenty minutes daily to early morning sunrays. \n\nPrecautions for Hypothyroidism :\n\nAvoid refined foods, saturated fats, sugars, and white flour products. If the thyroid problem is severe it is then good to avoid brussels sprouts, cabbage, broccoli, kale, mustard greens, peaches and pears as they have anti-thyroid substances and may suppress the thyroid function.\n\nBeverages including coffee, tea, carbonated drinks and alcohols should be avoided by patients afflicted with thyroid disorders. \n\nWe are especially thankful to Achariya Mohan Gupta (Naturecurist, H-32/22, Sector-3, Rohini, Near Vishram Chowk, New Delhi) for unique assist for creating this video.\n\nFor more details, you can join free classes or camps at Natural Life Style (H-32/22, Sector-3, Rohini, New Delhi-110085)\n\nFor More Exclusive Videos, Please Subscribe Us.\n\nPlease shear this Video on Your Blog, Facebook, Twitter or Google+ Wall.", "title": "Natural Treatment of Hypothyroidism by Dr Mohan Gupta (Hindi) (1080p HD)", "publishedDate": "2014-06-24T09:43:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "0bXFnUl7XhM", "description": "Subscribe to TRAILERS:\u00a0http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\nSubscribe to COMING SOON:\u00a0http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\nLike us on FACEBOOK:\u00a0http://goo.gl/dHs73\nJinn Official TRAILER (2014) Supernatural Thriller Movie HD\n\nIn the Beginning, Three were Created...\nMan made of Clay.\nAngels made of Light.\nAnd a Third...made of Fire.\n\nFrom the beginning, stories of angels and men have captured our imaginations and have been etched into our history crossing all boundaries of culture, religion, and time.

The usual procedure is to shoot the cow and kill it, providing an instant and humane death. I dispatched this cow with a shot to the brain from a distance of 10 feet. I followed that shot up with a second shot, also to the brain.\n\nAt this point we diverged from the normal butchering operation. This cow is headed for the dinning room table, but it also presented an opportunity to do some ballistic tests with lead bullets, loaded with Unique powder. Careful consideration was given so as not to damage meat destined for the table. We decided to do the penetration tests just behind the normal heart/lung shot placement. We would establish a point of impact with an orange target spot, and shift that point from shot to shot.\n\n\nWe hoped to catch a bullet after penetrating the cow -- and used a column of water filled milk jugs as containment media. Took a little doing to line everything up, but it worked out well.\n\nThe results:\n\nThe 32-20 penetrated 30 inches of cow and 6 water filled milk jugs.\n\nThe 38-55 penetrated 30 inches of cow and 5 water filled milk jugs.\n\nThe 45-70 penetrated 30 inches of cow and 7 water filled milk jugs.\n\nThe load specifics are listed in the photos with their respective bullets.

She spent her early life in her home village of Kalugwis, located in the very center of Kwakwaka'wakw territory. There she learned her first language, Kwakwala, and was formally trained and educated in many aspects of traditional culture. Maxine has dedicated her talents to her people in order that their traditional culture remains vibrant and strong.\n\nAs a child, Maxine was encouraged to assist her mother, Jesse Matilpi (Wadidi), and other elders with making blankets and other regalia projects. Her first job was to sort buttons by size, she later graduated to more complex tasks such as cutting the appliqu\u00e9 designs and border trim from red cloth. In 1985, she completed her first button blanket without assistance and since then she has created nearly 100 ceremonial items in fabric which include button blankets, dance aprons, vest and tunics.\n\nHer mother's generation preferred to use the woolen Hudson's Bay Company blanket as a base for the ceremonial robe and used felt or cotton broadcloth for the borders and the central design. In most instances, the blankets used were navy blue or deep green in color. Maxine's first choice of material is melton cloth, which is both denser and lighter than the woolen blanket. Almost unique among contemporary aboriginal fabric artists is her use of stroud, an old woven trade cloth, as her appliqu\u00e9 material. The main crest figures on her blankets are designed by her partner, John Livingston, an artist who has mastered both the two dimensional and sculptural forms of Northwest Coast art. The boarder designs are defined with buttons are of her own creation and include solid triangles which symbolize mountains, and sinuous compositions incorporating vines, leaves and flowers.\n\nOne of Maxine's favorite and recurring images is that of a butterfly; it appears both on border designs and as the primary figure on blankets and aprons. It represents an important family crest. It is said that long ago when the world was young, an old man emerged from under the sea. A butterfly landed on his head and since then it has come to symbolize the ancient lineage from which Maxine's family descended.\n\nOther significant crests depicted on her costumes are the mythic bird Kolus (said to be the younger brother of Thunderbird), Raven, Wolf, and Whale, all of which figure prominently in her family history. These images are jealously guarded family privileges and are properly displayed only in ceremonial context.\n\nIn 1995, Maxine completed a suite of blankets, aprons and tunics to be worn by family members at a memorial potlatch. Most of the objects displayed in this exhibit were used in ceremony. The regalia is a tribute to an accomplished artist who has dedicated her talent to her people in order that their traditional culture remains vibrant and strong.\n\nwww.quintanagalleries.com\n\nVideo produced by MeewaCinema\nwww.meewacinema.com", "title": "Native American Artist Series: Maxine Matilpi", "publishedDate": "2013-03-15T18:21:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "0beK1aIugFo", "description": "this bad-ass little dude was hanging out under the stairs.

We were experimenting with rubber compounds and grip patterns when Shane got involved and told us he'd be really into a flangeless grip with a symmetrical shape that had a bigger, chunky grip pattern. The circular grip design was underway, but everything dropped into place when we added a sand-blasted texture to the grip. Suddenly they weren't circles any more, but craters on the surface of the moon! Shane was really into it and so the Moon grip was born.\n\nAs this grip had such a unique look there was no way we could use our normal bar end with it. So, with Shane we worked up a design which blended perfectly into the style and shape of the grip and the rest is history.\n\nThe final compound is a really soft 23\u00b0 durameter, high quality Kraton rubber. It's both soft and comfy but at the same time feels sticky with loads of grip. At 150mm long it looks awesome on a wider bar, and the tighter 19mm internal diameter means there's plenty of life in them too!\n\nFilmed and edited by Nathan Williams\n\nFor more info check eclatbmx.com/products/grips-barends/moon-grips/", "title": "Shane Weston Moon Grip Promo *ALT INTRO*", "publishedDate": "2013-07-17T09:44:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "0bnID8QhzUU", "description": "For Lyrics - http://www.indicine.com/movies/lyrics/bhang-ke-nashe-lyrics-kailash-kher/\n\nMovie: Four Two Ka One\nMusic Composer: Avishek Majumder\nLyrics: Ashok Upadhyay\nSinger: Kailash Kher, Ritu Pathak", "title": "Bhang Ke Nashe Full Song from Four Two Ka One", "publishedDate": "2013-01-01T08:29:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "0bnUnuOUrKM", "description": "\"Humppa Of The North\":ssa 13-15.4.2007 Oulussa j\u00e4rjestetyss\u00e4 tanssipelitapahtumassa ollut napakymppi show: xenophics, Rangifer, Atso ja -\nhttp://humppa.kapsi.fi", "title": "Napakymppi a'la Hotn osa 2", "publishedDate": "2007-04-15T21:05:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "0bnkcsIKUDg", "description": "Due to a comment posted, I have modified the title of this video and will leave out which denomination we belonged to and will leave it to the viewers to determine what church we represented.....

Android. iPhone. But one company in China may have just thrown a third option into the mix. It's called the GooApple.\n\nThe iPhone. Considered a marvel of the modern age. Elegant and refined. A streamlined finish and a cute little android on the back? GooApple?\n\nThat's right, it seems there's a new rip-off of the iPhone hitting markets in China. It looks like an iPhone, it feels like an iPhone, but it's not an iPhone. Products like these are known as shanzhai bootlegs. Shanzhai literally means in Chinese \"mountain stronghold.\" It's a reference to historical warlord-hideouts that existed outside government control. Though you can be sure Genghis Khan never had one of these. \n\nIt runs on Android 2.2, but has been heavily modified to look like a typical iPhone OS.

What it does is it gets you out of your comfort zone. We all play licks, we all play lines. Even as we improvise we pretty much gravitate towards muscle memory, where our fingers are used to going. And by getting out of that box, we start to work on ways to not know where we're going next, which is really improvisation.\n\nBut what it also does is it helps us hone in on our picking technique, because if the left hand doesn't know what the right hand's doing and vice versa, and you're improvising in real time and you can't stop with the metronome, it really takes you out of your comfort zone. I'm just going to play random 8th notes. Now you'll hear that I kind of flubbed a few notes and why that was is because, keep in mind as soon as you find your fingers, and you find yourself going to natural places where you know, and you start playing a lick or you start playing a line that you've played before, stop yourself and remind yourself that you just have to play random 8th notes.\n\nAnd as soon as you do that, you'll see that you might flub a couple notes, because you're forcing your way out of the box to do some new things. And it's a really cool thing to do. You can also instead of 8th notes, you can do 8th note triplets and 16th notes, raising and lowering the BPM of the metronome. The faster you go and the rhythmic values that you do that a little harder it really becomes challenging. So here's some 8th note triplets. So you can hear that it's starting to really become a little bit more challenging. Let's try it slow first and then try it faster and you'll see that it's pretty cool. Keep in mind your picking hand and you'll really start to be able to get some better facility and get around the guitar. And your improvisational skills will definitely improve.", "title": "How to Play 8th, 16th & Triplet Notes | Guitar Pedals", "publishedDate": "2013-07-17T03:38:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "0btZ-8DVKlQ", "description": "Designing and generating many to many relationship tables with MySQL Workbench", "title": "Entity Relationship Modeling with MySQL Workbench", "publishedDate": "2012-04-14T22:59:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "0btkEvZPr2k", "description": "Just a custom fixed blade I commissioned a couple months ago.

Jared Goering served 1 tour in Iraq, 2 in Afghanistan, and spent 19 years as an active member of the Army. Jared said, \"I served from 1993 to 2012.\" He then told NBC40 he couldn't sleep Thursday night because he felt so disrespected by a North Wildwood police officer.\n\nGoering said, \"Just like any veteran with disabilities with a service dog, to come back and be harassed and shown no respect, it upset me - it really bothered me. I was up most of the night thinking about it.\"\n\nA North Wildwood police officer issued Jared and his wife a summons because of the dog. Goering said, \"I expected to get more respect from him because of the jobs that we both have to do.\"\n\n\"He mockingly asked if all veterans get service dogs,\" said Jared's wife, Sally Goering, \"his dog is medically necessary and he is a service dog.\"\n\nIn 2009, Jared was serving in Afghanistan when his vehicle was blown up by IEDs, twice, within 36 hours. Now, Jared uses his 3-year-old service dog, Gator, short for Navigator, to help him walk, and to get up and down stairs.\n\nJared explained, \"I also suffer from PTSD, severe anxiety, depression - and my dog plays a big part in my life. His main purpose is mobility but he also helps me with all my emotional problems from combat.\"\n\nJared and his wife Sally say the incident occurred on the 26th street North Wildwood boardwalk. The Goering family said, even after showing the officer the dog's service identification card, he still issued them a summons and kicked them off the boardwalk.\n\nSally said, \"We want the public to be aware that there are different types of disabilities and different types of service dogs - and police officers need to be educated about this.\"\n\nNorth Wildwood police officials say there are no pending charges, but that there are other circumstances surrounding the case.\n\nThe mayor of North Wildwood says they will issue a formal apology, if appropriate, pending the outcome of the investigation.", "title": "Disabled Veteran Kicked off Boardwalk Because of Service Dog - Jared Goering - North Wildwood", "publishedDate": "2013-08-11T00:22:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "0c1cKc_bvg8", "description": "\u0412 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0443-\u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0443, \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0448 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u043f\u0438\u0448\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043c \u0432\u044b \u0431\u044b \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0443\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e", "title": "\u0438\u043d\u0444\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0442 \u043c\u0438\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0430/ \u0456\u043d\u0444\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0442 \u043c\u0456\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0430/cardiac infarction", "publishedDate": "2013-06-13T09:29:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "0c1kR36KUFs", "description": "Click Show More!\n\n\n\n\nCF-Auto-Root Download: http://download.chainfire.eu/628/CF-Root/CF-Auto-Root/CF-Auto-Root-shamu-shamu-nexus6.zip\n\nhttp://DroidModderX.com\n\n\nTwitter @DroidModderX\n\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to this channel for Root, Rom, and Hack Guides for phones like the HTC One M8, Galaxy S5, Note 3, Galaxy S4, Moto X, and whatever device is coming out soon.

The goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is still one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a dark-gray/olive/brown carp native to east Asia (first domesticated in China) that was introduced to Europe in the late 17th century. The mutation that gave rise to the goldfish is also known from other cyprinid species, such as common carp and tench. Selective breeding over centuries has produced several color variations, some of them far removed from the \"golden\" color of the originally domesticated fish. There are also different body shapes, fin and eye configurations. Some extreme versions of the goldfish do need to be kept in an aquarium\u2014they are much less hardy than varieties closer to the \"wild\" original. However, some variations are hardier, such as the Shubunkin. The main varieties are Common Goldfish, Black Moor, Bubble Eye, Celestial Eye Goldfish, Comet-Tailed Goldfish, Fantail, Lionhead, Oranda, Pearlscale, Pompoms, Ryukin, Shubunkins, Demekin, Ranchu, Panda Moor & Veiltail. Ours are somewhere between Common and Fantail -- with large \"forked\" tails, flowing fins and an array of various colors. Goldfish do a great job cleaning up a tank but they produce a high level of PH so you need either a really good filter and / or constant water changes -- especially if you're going to have these in a tank.\n\nConvict Chichlids (Pond Sized)\nThe Convict cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) is a species of fish from the family Cichlidae, native to Central America, also known as the zebra cichlid. Convict cichlids are popular aquarium fish and have also been the subject of numerous studies on fish behaviour. In natural habitats, the species feeds on crustaceans, small fish, insects, various worms, plants and algae. In 2007, the species was moved from the genus Archocentrus to a new genus, Amatitlania based on a study of Archocentus species by Juan Schmitter-Soto. However, a 2008 study led by Oldrich Rican has suggested that all the species in Cryptoheros and Amatitlania, including Amatitlania nigrofasciata, should be moved into the genus Hypsophrys. A number of synonyms exist for this species including: Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, Cryptoheros nigrofasciatus and Heros nigrofasciatus. Convict cichlids are endemic to the lakes and streams of Central America. In particular, the species occurs along the eastern coast of Central America from Guatemala to Costa Rica, and on the western coast from Honduras to Panama. Convict cichlids prefer moving water, and are most frequently found in habitats with cover in the form of rocks or sunken branches. Convict cichlids are relatively tolerant of cool water, an ability which has allowed the species to colonise volcanic lakes at elevations of 1500 m (4920 feet). At four natural habitats of the convict cichlid in Costa Rica, the pH was found to range from 6.6 - 7.8, while alkalinity ranged from 63 to 77 ppm CaCO3. The daily water temperature ranged from 26-29 \u00b0C (79-84 \u00b0F). The species also occurs outside its natural range in Australia: in the warm effluent of power stations in Victoria, and in tropical Queensland. In addition to Australia, the species has been introduced to R\u00e9union, Japan, Mexico, and the USA. Convict cichlids are easily maintained and bred in aquariums. The aquarium should be decorated to mimic the natural environment and should include rocks and artificial caves for breeding. The species is an unfussy omnivore and most types of prepared fish foods are readily accepted. The species will also consume aquarium plants. Convict Cichlids are aggressively territorial during breeding and pairs are best kept alone in suitably sized aquariums. It has been suggested that brood care is reduced in aquarium strains. Due to the tendency of the species to dig, external filtration is recommended over undergravel filter systems. The relatively small size of this species, along with ease of keeping and breeding, make the convict an ideal cichlid for beginners and advanced aquarists alike interested in observing pair bonds and brood care in the aquarium. In very large environments, these fish tend to grow rather large, their body and fin structures become more elaborate and their gray-ish color turns into more of a neon purplish-blue. When understanding the psychology of these fish, they can be made to co-exist with things such as guppies, sword tails and other fish that they would normally hunt down and kill. Doing this is not recommended unless you already know what the hell you're doing :)", "title": "Pondscape.us - Don't Try This At Home - 2007", "publishedDate": "2008-12-24T01:49:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "0c5j6KRuYjw", "description": "3D Puff Embroidery Tutorial by Pro digitizing.\nVisit http://www.prodigitizing.com/\nThis is a step by step instructional video to learn how to sew-out a 3D embroidery design also known as 3D puff embroidery on an automatic or regular embroidery machine.", "title": "3D Puff Embroidery Tutorial", "publishedDate": "2011-03-05T20:34:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "0c5loaEUnig", "description": "The Department of Economics at UMass Amherst offers a broad range of online courses, including Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Marxian Economics, and Economic History.

Maybe trust has been damaged.  \n\nTrust can be damaged or destroyed in many ways.  Trust is damaged when laughing at, not with, the other person, talking behind each other\u2019s backs, gossiping or openly moralizing about another person\u2019s behavior.  Trust is damaged through expressions of disinterest or disrespect, and the refusal to reciprocate openness. \n\nSome people rely on equivocation, vagueness in word choice, or hinting when they feel vulnerable or uncomfortable with being completely honest.  This type of behavior can create suspicion.\n\nTrust is often\u2026destroyed\u2026 by betrayal, the abuse of another\u2019s vulnerability, usually through ridicule or through lying.  Once distrust is established, it is extremely hard to change.  It is sad when it happens.  The relationship will never be the same.\n\nPeople cite all sorts of reasons for lying.  People lie to acquire resources, protect resources, initiate and continue interaction, avoid conflict, avoid interaction, present a competent image, or increase social desirability.  Some people feel it is a risk to be honest; I think it is a risk to be a liar.\n\nTrust is damaged and destroyed in many ways and it is devastating.  When the trust level is low; team members will be evasive, dishonest, and manipulative.  \n\nWhen the trust level is high; team members openly express, thoughts, feelings, opinions, and information.  Your job is to be clear and concise, kind and thoughtful, and as honest as possible.\n\nCheck back to Welchlin.com every Monday for a new video blog.\n\u2003", "title": "How is trust destroyed?", "publishedDate": "2014-08-18T15:26:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "0cYStUP8g1w", "description": "", "title": "Similarities of Islam, Christianity, Judaism", "publishedDate": "2012-11-30T22:37:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "0cYcdalMXro", "description": "On board highlights of Anthony Lazzaro in Round 6 GT at The Pirelli World Challenge Cadillac V-Series Grand Prix of Belle Isle in Detroit.", "title": "Detroit 2014 - Anthony Lazzaro On Board Highlights of Round 6 GT", "publishedDate": "2014-06-02T00:09:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "0cYcnbyXA7k", "description": "Primer encendido de HISENSE HS-U970, movil de fabricaci\u00f3n china con una relaci\u00f3n calidad/precio m\u00e1s que excelente.

Da Buddha is one of the iconic whip style vaporizers in the industry. It features a Ground Glass connection between the wand and the heater cover which ensures a completely hands-free experience, meaning you, the user, doesn't need to hold the wand close to the heating element in order to vaporize the plant material.\n\nThe Da Buddha Vaporizer is intended for aromatherapy use only with loose leaf material.\n\nVisit VaporNation on Google+ https://plus.google.com/+VaporNationVaporizerStore\nHangout with the Vapor MC https://plus.google.com/+VaporMC\n\nCREDITS: \n\nProducer: Bobby Fernandez\nDirector: Jason Hernandez\nHost: Mark Richardson\n\nVIDEO TRANSCRIPT:\n\nWhat's up Vape fans? Vapor MC here. In this video I'm going to show you how to use one of the legendary whip-style vaporizers in our inventory. Meet Da Buddha, made by 7th Floor.\n\nDa Buddha is available in either black or silver, and comes with the following accessories: three feet of vinyl tubing, a glass mouthpiece, a ground glass wand, a stir stick, ten replacement screens, and a handy padded storage bag for easy and convenient travel.\n\nTo turn on the Da Buddha, simply turn the knob on the front of the unit clockwise until you reach the 2 o'clock position. Now, if you want more robust vapor, for more experience connoisseurs, you can go up to the 3 o'clock position. however we recommend that you never turn the dial all the way up because this will combust your herbs we guarantee it.\n\nI've pre-assembled the wand and whip so now we're going to load the wand. simply take a couple pinches of your favorite blend, and drop it onto the screen inside the wand. It's important to pack your herbs loosely because if you pack too tightly you won't get even vaporization. \n\nThe Da Buddha employs a ground glass connection on both the wand and the heater cover. To employ the ground glass connection simply slide the top of the wand into the heater cover and let it sit freely. This is a true hands-free connection which creates an airtight seal, ensuring the most efficient vaporization possible. And when we say hands-free we mean you don't have to manually hold the wand next to the heating element while you're vaporizing. \n\nThe Da Buddha features a ceramic heating element and high quality glass in the wand. This ensures that you are receiving the cleanest, purest, most delicious vapor imaginable. Seriously. You can really taste the essence of your blends and get full, satisfying clouds every single time.\n\nWhat's great about 7th Floor Vaporizers is they also make hand blown custom glass accessories for the Da Buddha Vaporizer, such as heating covers, wands, mouthpieces, and the Vapor Tamer, a cooling device which will cool down the vapor so it doesn't irritate your throat. Every Da Buddha Vaporizer is also backed by a 3-year Manufacturer's Warranty, which covers any defect relating to the unit.\n\nThank you for watching.
