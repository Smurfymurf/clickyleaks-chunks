At that time the island was uninhabited and covered in a dense forest. The Arab sailors were not interested in settling on the island which they named Dina Arobi or Dinarobin. Fernandez Pereira, a Portuguese sailor found the island in 1505 and decided to give it the name of Cerne. However, the Portuguese did not settle permanently on the island either.\nThe first to colonise the island were the Dutch. They took possession of the island in 1598. The Dutch settlers landed on a bay in the south-eastern part of the island which was named Warwyck Haven after the commander VanWarwyck, the bay is now known as Grand Port. Mauritius also got its name during this period; the island was named after the Prince of Holland Mauritz de Nassau.\nIn 1710, the Dutch abandoned the island, leaving behind macaques, the java deer, sugar cane, fugitive slaves and, also, an irreversible damage to the endemic and indigenous flora and fauna of the island - the Dodo was, by then, extinct due to extensive hunting, the bird being very easy to capture, while the once abundant black ebony tree population was almost completely depleted due to over-exploitation for its timber.\nThe French settled on the island in 1712, also landing at the bay in the south-east. They renamed the bay Port Bourbon and renamed the island Ile de France. They settled on the north-western side of the island and established their main harbour there, Port Louis, the present-day capital of Mauritius. During the French settlement there was a lot of development in the country. Mah\u00e9 de Labourdonnais, whose statue can be seen across from the harbour in Port louis,is known as the founder of the capital city and the island prospered under his governance (1735-1746).\nEnjoy Your Mauritius Tours!", "title": "Mauritius Tours", "publishedDate": "2014-08-16T08:37:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "2bRDae-87sM", "description": "\"Scots Wha Hae\" by Robert Burns (available on the album, \"A Memory\" http://www.robertburns.plus.com/CD.htm) is Robert the Bruce's address to his troops before the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 in which Scotland maintained its sovereignty from the Kingdom of England.  This spoken version is presented by David Sibbald of http://www.robertburns.plus.com and created by Peigi McCann (Peggy Edwards) of http://www.sierranatureprints.com and features Frank Boyd as William Wallace and Paul Hunter as Robert the Bruce in addition to the illustrations of Sarah Crome of http://www.auchbooks.co.uk/ and N.C.

The sword used in the video is an accurate replica of the sword of William Wallace. \n\nKnowing he risked being sent to Botany Bay for such sentiments, Burns agreed to let it be published saying, 'let them insert it as a thing they have met with by accident, and unknown to me.'\nWhen Burns' submitted his ode to Thomson he said, \"There is a tradition which I have met with in many places in Scotland, that it (the tune Hey, Tuttie Tatie) was Robert Bruce's march at the battle of Bannockburn. This thought, in my solitary wanderings, warmed me to a\npitch of enthusiasm on the theme of liberty and independence, which I threw into a kind of Scottish ode, fitted to the air, that one might suppose to be the royal Scot's address to his heroic followers on that eventful morning.\"\n\nThe spider represents the Arachnid Bruce observed spinning her web in a cave in which he was hiding out at the lowest point of his life.

In the New World she would eventually rise up to become the leader of a new nation. Sadly, not many people outside of Jamaica know of the Legendary \"Nanny,\" warrior chieftainess of the Jamaican Maroons, who led a band of former enslaved Africans in the rugged mountains of Jamaica to a decisive victory over the mighty British army during the early to mid-18th century.\n\nWhat will you see in the film?\n\nAs we seek to uncover the history and legacy of this larger than life mystical figure, her intriguing story will be told through songs, reenactments, performances, expert interviews from top scholars and researchers, and most importantly the Maroons themselves. To be filmed in Jamaica, Ghana, United States, and the United Kingdom; it is our aim to make Queen Nanny: Legendary Maroon Chieftainess not only a stunning visual piece, but also an important study in man's innate desire to remain free and to use all the tools at his/her disposal in pursuit of that necessary human need for freedom.\n\nA call to action!\n\nIn 1993 UNESCO (The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) declared the Jamaican Maroon community of Moore Town (New Nanny Town) one of the world's 28 'Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage'. Starting with the indomitable ancestress Queen Nanny, Maroons have maintained a continuous presence in Jamaica for more than three hundred years; living on the same treaty lands gained as a result of their epic 80-year plus battle with the vaunted British military. Their proud African-based language, culture and governance are still very much alive today. In our own small way, we're hoping that this film can be used as a catalyst to help safeguard and highlight one of the world's most fascinating cultures that is being threatened with extinction. Your help will go a long way in making sure that the amazing against-all-odds story of these Maroons will never die.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nThere's no question the film-making process is expensive, but on a global scale it can have a major impact, which is what we are hoping for in our film. In order to make Queen Nanny the very best that it can be, we need your help. This project will shoot in 2014 with an estimated budget of more than $350,000. While we continue to look for additional funding, I wanted to use this Indiegogo campaign as a way to spread the word, and get everyone involved. With your contribution - you will make it possible for us to start capturing some key footage and interviews in Jamaica and Africa. As they say in Jamaica, \"every mikkle, make a mukkle (every bit counts)\"  For your contributions and generous support, we will be offering some great perks, such as tickets to the premiere of the film, exclusive private screenings, autographed DVDs, and much more. Below are areas that we will be directing campaign funds. \n\n\n- pre-production office expenses and travel\n- hiring local production crews in Jamaica and Ghana\n- capturing b-roll footage, interviews, and reenactments\n- 30-person expedition to the site of Old Nanny Town in the Blue Mountains (a potential    UNESCO World Heritage Site)\n- perks fulfillment\n\nLast word!\n\nIt's not all about the money (it helps, yes). But if you're unable to contribute financially, we're asking you to please spread the word via facebook, twitter, and other social media networks. This film speaks to the underdog spirit in all of us; something that we celebrate every time the weak reigns triumphant over the mighty.

Some authors still contend that the yacare caiman is a subspecies of the common caiman (e.g., Caiman crocodilus yacare). \n\nCaiman crocodilus subspecies:\nThere are a few other putative subspecies of Caiman crocodilus worth mentioning. The apaporiensis caiman was described by Medem in 1955. He referred to its type locality as being in the upper Rio Apaporis, between the falls of Jirijimo and Puerto Yaviya. There is no synonymy beyond Medem's consistent use of Caiman sclerops to refer to spectacled caimans. \n\nThe brown caiman (C. crocodilus fuscus) was first described by Cope (1868) as Perosuchus fuscus. Subsequent authors did not deem it sufficiently different from other spectacled caimans to warrant its own generic epithet. It is worth noting that, although Cope described his Perosuchus as lacking a supraorbital ridge, his description was based on a single juvenile obtained by the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and therefore he could easily have been mistaken on this point. Boulenger (1889) and Vaillant (1898) both considered this taxon to be part of sclerops. It is typically distinguished from other forms of Caiman crocodilus by a tan to olive brown coloration, hence its common name. This caiman has a range that extends through parts of Mexico, Central America, Colombia and Venezuela. Some authors refer to the caiman of Mexico and Central America as a separate subspecies (Caiman crocodilus chiapasius); the chiapasius name originated with Bocourt in 1876 and is in the synonymy of fuscus. \n\nA final note about subspecies: My master's thesis work involves examining the phylogenetic relationships among caimans, including the putative subspecies of C. crocodilus. As a proponent of a species concept based on the idea that evolution is important and that species are real, evolving entities (see Cracraft 1989, Frost and Kluge 1994, Hull 1976, et cetera), I reject the reality of subspecies. As a result, if I find distinct genetic differences among the caimans referred to as subspecies, I will consider this sufficient evidence to elevate these taxa to species rank; I will make the appropriate recommendations in my thesis and publications resulting from it. I hope, therefore, that my work will help to clarify some of the present murkiness surrounding caiman taxonomy. \n\n\n\nEl caim\u00e1n de anteojos, cachirre, babilla o baba (Caiman crocodylus o Caiman sclerops) es una especie de reptil carn\u00edvoro que habita los diferentes tipos de cursos de agua dulce, ci\u00e9nagas y pantanos en el sur de M\u00e9xico, Centroam\u00e9rica y el noroeste de Suram\u00e9rica.El Caim\u00e1n Enano (Paleosuchus palpebrosus) es un caim\u00e1n en la familia Alligatoridae.

The 11 species of badger are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (9 Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel) and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus european), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae. Badgers include the species in the genera Meles, Arctonyx, Taxidea and Mellivora. Their lower jaws are articulated to the upper by means of transverse condyles firmly locked into long cavities of the skull, so dislocation of the jaw is all but impossible. This enables the badgers to maintain their hold with the utmost tenacity, but limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut, or sliding from side to side without the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most mammals. Badgers have rather short, fat bodies, with short legs for digging. They have elongated weasel-like heads with small ears. Their tails vary in length depending on species; the stink badger has a very short tail, while the ferret badger's tail can be 46--51 cm long, depending on age. They have black faces with distinctive white markings, gray bodies with a light-coloured stripe from head to tail, and dark legs with light coloured stomachs. They grow to around 90 centimetres in length including tail. The European badger is one of the largest; the American badger, the hog badger and the honey badger are generally a little smaller and lighter. The stink badgers are smaller still, and the ferret badgers are the smallest of all. They weigh around on average, with some Eurasian badgers weighing in at around The diet of the Eurasian badger consists largely of earthworms, insects, grubs, and the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds. funny animal animals crazy craziest insane blooper bloopers fail fails dam dams beaver beavers rodent rodents danger dangers rabid rabies disease diseases diseased swim swims swimming swimmer swimmers water waters waterfall waterfalls falls niagra ontario canada cottage cottages country cute cutest cub cubs mice mouse rat rats bite bites attack attacks hunt hunts hunter hunters hunting cook cooking eat eats eating cooks fire trap traps trapping pest pests snare snares fish fishing fisher fishers fisherman fishermen weasels, stoats, ferrets and otters They also eat small mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds, as well as roots and fruit. In Britain, they are the only predator honey rock of hedgehogs, which have demonstrably lower populations in areas where badgers are numerous, so that hedgehog rescue societies will not release hedgehogs into known badger territories. In some areas they are known to predate lambs, and may bite a ewe defending her lamb, almost always leading to infection of the bite. They are occasional predators of domestic chickens, and are able to break into enclosures that a fox cannot. In southern Spain, badgers feed to a significant degree on rabbits. The honey badger of Africa consumes honey, porcupines and even venomous snakes (such as the puff adder); they will climb trees to gain access to honey from bees' nests. American badgers are fossorial carnivores -- i.e. they catch a significant proportion of their food underground, by digging. They can tunnel after ground-dwelling rodents at speed. Badgers have been known to become intoxicated with alcohol after eating rotting fruit. Hunting badgers has been common in many countries. The Dachshund dog breed was bred as a badger hound; Dachs is the German word for badger The blood sport of badger-baiting was outlawed in the United Kingdom by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, and the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 made it a serious offence to kill, injure or take a badger, or to damage or interfere with a sett unless a licence is obtained from a statutory authority. An exemption that allowed fox hunters to loosely block setts to prevent chased foxes escaping into them was brought to an end with the Hunting Act 2004. Badgers can be fierce animals and will protect themselves and their young at all costs, are capable of fighting off dog-packs and fighting off much larger animals, such as wolves and bears. However, badgers can be tamed and then kept as pets Today, badgers are commercially trapped for their pelts, which are used to make shaving brushes and clothing. Badger hair is particularly suited for shaving brushes due to its water retention. Virtually all commercial badger hair comes from mainland China, which supplies knots of hair in three grades to brush makers in both China and Europe. In rural Northern China, badgers multiplied to the point of becoming a crop nuisance, and village cooperatives are licensed by the national government to hunt badgers and process their hair", "title": "Strange man holds a Honey Badger", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T20:47:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "2blZn3Me_6U", "description": "", "title": "Skrewdriver   Oh no here comes a commie!", "publishedDate": "2011-05-21T15:21:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "2bllMz4-yFw", "description": "How to throw boiling water into the air and have it freeze instantly.

But some causative difference is there in between vitiligo & Leucoderma. Basically Leucoderma is a Latin word which literally means 'white skin'. It is popularly known as white patch also. It generally happens due to absence of melanin pigmentation over the skin.\n\nWisely we call it a 'disorder' as no pain and symptoms can be found in Vitiligo & Leucoderma. It may start with a small spot which later enlarge into a large white patch. It may be pale in colour initially but gradually it turns white with time due to complete loss of melanin pigmentation over affected areas. The shape and size of a white patch cannot be judged. The social value of Vitiligo & Leucoderma is dominant over its medical value preferably in India and almost all over the world due to its prominence over skin which differentiates a person from others.

As with most fruits persimmons are high in vitamin C and carotenoid anti-oxidants.  They are also a good source of iodine if eaten fresh - not something many foods can boast.\n\nBeing an orange food they are said to help activation in the second energy centre of the body associated with pleasure.  Therefore, if you are feeling down, not enough happiness or fun in your life you may want to eat some of these.  Orange colours are also said to support the spleen and kidneys.\n\nThere are two general types of persimmon, although many varieties exist within these types:  astringent and non-astringent.  The astringent type you can only eat when it is mushy soft or the tannins will turn your mouth inside out :-)  The non-astringent type you eat when it is firm and crunchy, a common variety being the Fuyu fruit.\n\nI hope this was helpful; thank you as always for watching.\n\nCONNECT WITH ME ON FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/darren.hey.92\n\nFollow photographic updates and information on food growing, natural living and regeneration on INSTAGRAM: @ NATURESCLASSROOM\n\nTo contact Dr John Fielder of the Academy of Natural Living for enquiries go to: www.johnfielder.com.au\n\nDisclaimer:  The information contained within this vlog is for informational purposes only and not intended to diagnose, prescribe or proscribe for any particular individual or condition suffered.

The protest did not eventuate.\n\nParliament resumes today and several members of the Government told AM they had expected the Prime Minister to get his way.\n\nLNP backbencher George Christensen, an outspoken opponent of Islamic facial coverings, told AM, that \"segregating people in an area probably isn't the best thing\".\n\n\"I suppose [the Speaker and the Senate President] were looking for a happy medium,\" Mr Christensen said.\n\n\"I think what was found ... had a lot of adverse reaction more so than simply banning facial coverings in Parliament House would have.\n\n\"I think the best thing is simply to say we need to see your face in Parliament. Everyone's welcome as long as we can see your face.\n\n\"It's a debate that needs to be had.\"\n\nLabor says questions still need to be answered\n\nLabor frontbencher Matt Thistlethwaite said the reversal was a welcome move.\n\n\"But the question needs to be asked why this even occurred in the first place,\" he said.\n\n\"Security at Parliament House is paramount and people go through security checks every day before they come into the Parliament.\n\n\"Once they have cleared that check, they should be able to, subject to protocols, move around Parliament and not be segregated as was proposed by the Speaker and the President.\"\n\nSenator Parry is likely to be grilled about the interim decision in Senate estimates this morning.\n\nThe Speaker and the Senate President did not respond to AM's requests for comment.\n\n\n\nA controversial plan to segregate people wearing face coverings in Parliament House has been abandoned.\n\nAt-a-glance: Burqa, niqab and hijab\n\nParliament's presiding officers have dumped their controversial interim ruling that people wearing burqas or niqabs in the public galleries be segregated behind glass.\n\nIn a new security circular issued by the Department of Parliamentary Services this morning, visitors will now be required to show their faces and to show identification upon entering Parliament House but after that, will be free to move around.\n\nOn the last day of the sitting fortnight two weeks ago, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Bronwyn Bishop, and the Senate President, Senator Stephen Parry, issued a temporary ruling that anyone wearing facial coverings would be required to sit in soundproof glassed-galleries high above the chambers, normally reserved for school children.\n\nThe move followed a request from South Australian Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi for the presiding officers to ban the burqa in Parliament altogether.\n\nIt is understood the segregation move was made after concerns were raised that protesters may be planning to enter the galleries wearing burqas or niqabs.\n\nIn the Senate, Senator Parry said the ruling was designed to be able to identify hecklers.\n\nBut the ruling prompted a community backlash and the Prime Minister stepped in to request it be revised.\n\nIn the new ruling issued today, the department says that all visitors entering Parliament House will be \"required to temporarily remove any coverings that prevent the recognition of facial features\".\n\n\"This will enable DPS security staff to identify any person who may have been banned from entering Parliament House or who may be known, or discovered, to be a security risk,\" it says. \n\n\"Once this process has taken place, visitors are free to move about the public spaces of the building, including all chamber galleries, with facial coverings in place.\"\n\nThe House of Representatives resumes sittings today and the Senate begins a week of Budget Estimates committee hearings, in which Senator Parry faces questions on the running of Parliament.", "title": "Burka segregation in Parliament is reversed by Speaker Bronwyn Bishop", "publishedDate": "2014-10-20T21:36:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "2cRjBlspqi8", "description": "Dickies -

The game is about a group of \"terrorists\" who have traitors among them, out to kill everyone who's not a traitor.\n\nA small number of players is selected as Traitors, who have to kill all the Innocent players (ie. the rest of the players). Those innocents know they are in the majority, but they do not know who is Traitor and who is not.\n\nThe Traitors must use the element of surprise and their special equipment, if they are to succeed. The Innocent just have to survive, which means finding out who the Traitors are and killing them before they kill you. Of course everyone is holding a big gun, and everyone looks suspicious...\n\nFor the Innocent, knowledge is power: who is acting strangely? Who can be linked to evidence found on corpses? Who is still alive, even?\"\n\nChilled: https://www.youtube.com/user/CriousGamers\nZe: https://www.youtube.com/user/ZeMachinima\nMark: https://www.youtube.com/user/AllShamNoWow\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/SeaNanners\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/SeaNannersPage\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seananno", "title": "TALKING TELEVISION (Garry's Mod Trouble in Terrorist Town)", "publishedDate": "2014-03-26T16:00:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "2cWNbK4yneI", "description": "Eggs & fire", "title": "Terrible Trouble in the Kitchen", "publishedDate": "2014-01-02T12:29:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "2cWSSPvO58o", "description": "http://de.twitch.tv/kphome91letsplays\nSorry f\u00fcr die Verwirrung :D\n__________________________________________________________\n\nIch w\u00fcrde mich sehr \u00fcber Eurer Feedback oder \u00fcber eine Positive Bewertung freuen ;-) \n__________________________________________________________\n\nMeinen Kanal Abbonieren: http://www.youtube.com/user/kphomeLP\nFolgt mir auf Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/kphome.lp.3\nFolgt mir auf Twitter: https://twitter.com/kphomeLP\n__________________________________________________________", "title": "UPDATE!

As soon as he was old enough to work, Isidore entered the service of John de Vergas, a wealthy resident of Madrid, as a farm labourer on his estate outside the city, and with that one employer he remained all his life. He married a girl as poor and as good as himself, but after the birth of one son, who died young, they agreed to serve God in perfect continence. Isidore's whole life was a model of Christian perfection lived in the world. He would rise early to go to church, and all day long, whilst his hand guided the plough, he would be communing with God, with his guardian angel or with the holy saints. Public holidays he would spend in visiting the churches of Madrid and the neighbouring districts. The saint's liberality to the poor was so great that he was wont to share his meals with them, often reserving for himself only the scraps they left over.\nAmongst the numerous  stories told of the holy man is one which illustrates his love for animals. On a snowy winter's day, as he was carrying a sack of corn to be ground, he saw a number of birds perched disconsolately on the bare branches, obviously unable to find anything to eat. Isidore opened the sack and, in spite of the jeers of a companion, poured out half  its contents upon the ground. When however, they reached their destination the sack proved to be still full and the corn, when ground, produced double the usual amount of flour.\nSt Isidore died on May 15, 1130. His wife survived him for several years and, like him, is honoured as a saint. Forty years after the death of St Isidore his body was transferred to a more honourable shrine, and a great impetus was given to his cult by the report of many miracles worked through his intercession. In 1211, he is said to have appeared in a vision to King Alphonsus of Castile, then fighting the Moors in the pass of Navas de Tolosa, and to have shown him an unknown path by means of which he was able to surprise and defeat the enemy.\nThe Spanish royal family had long desired to have St Isidore formally enrolled amongst the saints, and in March 1622 he was duly canonized.", "title": "Fiesta Island  2013", "publishedDate": "2013-05-21T10:15:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "2cZEj6MW1mQ", "description": "Full Title: \n\nBodily interaction in the dark\n\nAuthors:\n\nLinden Vongsathorn, Kenton O'Hara, Helena M. Mentis\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn light of the growing interest in designing for new body-movement based interfaces through somaesthetics and somatic awareness, we created a sound-based interaction using the Microsoft Kinect device, which is performed in the dark. The absence of visual feedback led participants to deeply focus on the movement of their bodies, and to have a different awareness of their bodies and the space around them.

She continues the genre with You've Got Mail, marking her second collaboration with actors Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. The story brings romance and courtship into the electronic age of the World Wide Web via e-mail and chat rooms. Joe Fox (Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) live and work blocks from each other on New York City's Upper West Side. Their lives are practically intertwined. They both shop at the same place, frequent the same coffee shop, and even own competing bookstores on the same street. They also both have significant others of their own. Joe has the overly hyper book editor Patricia Eden (Parker Posey), while Kathleen lives with the scholarly newspaper columnist Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear). Then they meet in a chat room. Though they keep their identities secret (they're known only by screen names \"NY152\" and \"Shopgirl\"), they tell each other everything about their lives, including their private feelings, which slowly turn into affection for each other. When Joe decides to open a new branch of his \"Foxbooks\" chain that risks putting Kathleen's \"Shop Around the Corner\" out of business, the tension between them escalates. Surely her boutique business will be lost to the conglomerate with a built-in newsstand and coffee bar. When Joe sees Kathleen waiting for him in the restaurant where they agreed to meet up, he puts two and two together, but cannot face her, given their agreement not to reveal each others' names and professions. How can he reveal himself to her now, knowing that he is the cause of her misery? Hopefully, love will conquer all.\n\n\"you've got mail\",\"you've got mail clip\",\"you've got mail part 1\",\"you've got mail soundtrack\",\"you've got mail full movie\",\"you've got mail ending\",\"you've got mail sound\",\"you've got mail scene\",\"tom hanks\",\"meg ryan\",\"romantic comedies\",comedy,\"lauren shuler donner\",\"g mac brown\",\"donald j lee jr\",\"dianne dreyer\",\"nora ephron\",\"julie durk\",\"delia ephron\",\"love videos\",\"romance videos\",\"park videos\",\"joe fox\",\"kathleen kelly\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++174227,/m/0bxtg,/m/0dn3n", "title": "You've Got Mail (5/5) Movie CLIP - I Wanted It To Be You (1998) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-29T19:03:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ck0nxPBklc", "description": "The extremist preacher described Michael Adebolajo, one of the men alleged to have been involved in the killing of a young soldier in Woolwich on Wednesday, as a \"very quiet, very shy man.\"\n\nOmar Bakri founded the Islamist group Al-Muhajiroun, with which Adebolajo is believed to have been associated. \n\nMr Bakri said that Adebolajo had openly acknowledged his actions and that he was sending a message to the world that \"as long as you are at war with Islam and Muslims, there will always be Muslims to [exact] revenge. \n\n\"He believed he attacked military targets, he attacked British soldiers, not attack civilians,\" he said. \n\nMr Bakri was banned from Britain in 2005.

Huntsinger \n\nFinally, I am riding a bike again after long battle with Late Lyme Disease. Lyme is multi-systemic infection that causes crippling results throughout the body! Like most Lyme patients, I have been to Hell and back dozens of times with this persistent infection! \n\nWhen I was age 22, I caught the fungal lung disease common to The South: Histoplasmosis. It left some scars. \n\nLater at age 30, while canoeing a river near Nashville, Tennessee called \"The Narrows of the Harpeth,\" I was bitten by nymphal ticks.\n\nThose tiny ticks were in my belly button and groin! I tweezed them out and flushed them into the toilet.\nWithin a week, I was horribly ill with fevers and could not walk! I sought help, diagnosis and antibiotic treatment for over 2-1/2 years before I was given my first dose of Doxycycline! Because all the ignorant physicians said: \"But there is no Lyme Disease in Tennessee!\"\nThen how did I and several of my neighbors get it??!\n\nNow decades later...I know more about tick diseases than most doctors. I had to learn things medical to save my own life. But that first dose of Doxycycline hit the offending bacteria (Borrelia burgdorferi) so hard that I had a small stroke....which left me bedridden, with weakness especially on the left side. I had to relearn how to walk.\nTo this day, I often still need at least one cane.\n\nMy entire story is very long. I had seizures and Bell's Palsy, Hemifacial Spasm, Trigeminal Neuralgia... wicked Arthritis...Vertigo, Multi-sensory Disorientation and Cardiac troubles too!  \n\nI saw dozens of doctors along my journey. Some sinners and some Saints. I was told I had Lupus, MS, Rheumatoid Arthritis, \"The Worst Asthma ever\"... Fibromyalgia  and many other conditions. Also was told I was crazy more than once.\n\nThankfully, I met the physicians known as LLMD's (Lyme Literate Medical Doctors) who helped me get appropriate testing proof and treatment enough to save my life.\nI am very grateful even though still not \"cured.\" I am indebted to Dr. Richard Horowitz for diagnosing my Babesiosis and proving it with an IGeneX PCR/DNA test in 5.26.02.\n\nI also feel grateful for the late Dr. Edwin Masters, Dr. C. Crist, Dr. W. Tuley, Dr. Paul LeVois, Dr. Audrey Steingoldings, Epileptologist Dr. Khalil, Dr. Daniel Cameron, Dr. Burrascano, and Dr. Q. Zhang, who is also a stellar diagnostician and physician...and all who helped me stay alive this long. God bless you all and we need cures for multiple pathogen diseases called \"MSIDS\" now.\n\nPS: The audible cough I have is with me on my bad days. I am not certain if it represents a lung/breathing issue or cardiac. I have a cardiac rhythm disorder known as LBBB from longstanding tick infections. Some days it troubles me greatly with weakness and tremors and other days I am not S bothered.\n\n\nSent from my iPhone", "title": "Riding a Bike Again after a long battle with Late Lyme Dise", "publishedDate": "2014-07-31T06:57:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "2cvmIz9bQDI", "description": "This is the title track from Minority Sound's second album.

Transplant patients must be carefully matched and then patients still must be given powerful drugs to prevent destruction of the transplanted tissue. Our bodies' immune system identifies tissue that's not its own and then tries to destroy that tissue.\n\nAs we have learned more about the immune system, doctors began asking themselves why a pregnant mother's body doesn't reject the foreign tissue of the baby growing inside her. The answer to this mystery is not fully understood, but research has suggested some answers.\n\nFrom conception, the unborn child is a genetically unique individual. Researchers think that the most important protection the unborn child has is the trophoblast. This tissue, known as the caul, seals the growing infant from its mother. However, the trophoblast itself develops from the same cells as the infant. So why doesn't the mother's immune system attack? It appears that under normal conditions the trophoblast is a special set of cells that the body cannot identify as foreign. In addition, the trophoblast makes cells that encourage the mother's immune system to protect it. Scientists now believe that this amazing feature may actually be provided by the father's genetic information.\n\nIn effect, the baby, with the help of the father, immunizes the mother's system so that it doesn't reject the baby! So, even before birth, the mother nurtures and the father protects the child.\n\nPrayer: \nFather in heaven, I marvel at the wondrous system You have designed for reproduction. Always keep me under Your protection and help me to grow to maturity in this life as I look forward to eternity with You. In Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\n Notes: \nWechsler, Rob. 1988. \"Hostile womb.\" Discover, Mar. p. 83.", "title": "Baby Immunizes Mother", "publishedDate": "2011-12-08T10:49:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "2cwYbbRF6wM", "description": "A Troupe Dance ensina a coreografia de 180,180, 360, sucesso de Kart Love.

Previously seen only with a tiny camera, the tomb is believed to contain the remains of Mayan ruler Pakal.\n\nFull Story:\n\nArchaeologists entered the tomb of an ancient Mayan ruler for the first time last week, revealing elaborate red frescoes, pottery and pieces of a funerary shroud.\n\nThe tomb has been sealed for 1,500 years. It was first discovered in 1999, located 19 feet deep from the top of a temple in the Mayan city of Palenque, nestled in the lush jungle hills of the southern Mexican state of Chiapas.\n\nInitial explorations of the ancient vault were previously only possible via remote-controlled cameras. When archaeologists finally entered the tomb through a tiny side entrance, they revealed priceless pottery pieces and a bright red mural that details mythical Mayan characters.\n\n[Arnoldo Gonzalez, Archaeologist]: \n\"On three of the walls there are remains of a mural painting which are people standing with dark hair pieces and sandals. And on the floor there are ceramic pieces and pieces from the mural.\" \n\nA team of 60 people, including archaeologists, restorers, chemists, architects, photographers and graphic designers, will be working to explore and preserve the tomb. However, only two people will be allowed inside at any time, wearing a special uniform in order to maintain a temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nMexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History believes the structure may have held the remains of Mayan ruler Pakal who lived between 431 and 550 AD.\n\nOnce excavations begin, researchers believe they could find skeletal remains and possibly more pottery and handcrafts, including priceless pieces made of jade, a green ornamental stone revered by the ancient Maya.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntdtv.org\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "Archaeologists Enter Sealed Ancient Mayan Tomb", "publishedDate": "2012-09-15T14:53:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "2d5CaSvPcjk", "description": "The Side-Zip Duffle Bags can be found at:  http://www.militaryuniformsupply.com/cargo-bags-front-load", "title": "Side-Zip Duffle Bags", "publishedDate": "2011-05-17T20:29:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "2d5DtvMI24M", "description": "Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, found in several parts of the world.

Junglefowl are the four living species of bird from the genus Gallus in the Gallinaceous bird order, which occur in India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia and Indonesia.\n\nThe tropical member of the Pheasant family The Red Junglefowl is also known as Gallis gallus. They are considered as the ancestors of the domestic chicken with some hybridization with the Grey Junglefowl.\nThe range of The Junglefowl is from Northeast India eastwards across southern China and down into Malaysia. Their flight is restricted to reaching their roosting areas at sunset in trees or other higher safe places which are free from predator threats or dangers. They generally feed on insects, seeds and fruits including those that are cultivated such as those of the oil palm hence are omnivorous.\n\nThe males have a very peculiar food related performance which is displayed upon finding food in the presence of a female. This display involves coaxing, cluck like calls and eye catching bobbing and twitching motions of the head and neck. The male repeatedly picks up and drops the food item with his beak while the display. At the end the female either taeks the food item from the ground or directly from the male's beak which later proceeds to copulation and more offspring. Purebred Red Junlglefowl is facing serious threats of extinction because of genetic pollution which is occurring at the edge of forests where domesticated free ranging chickens are commonly kept in bordering villages and towns.\n\nThese are large birds, with colourful male plumage, but are nevertheless difficult to see in the dense vegetation they inhabit.\n\nAs with many birds in the pheasant family, the male takes no part in the incubation of the egg or rearing of the precocial young. These duties are performed by the drab and well-camouflaged female.\n\nThe junglefowl are seed-eaters, but insects are also taken, particularly by the young birds.\nOne of the species in this genus, the Red Junglefowl, is of historical importance as the likely ancestor of the domesticated chicken, although it has been suggested the Grey Junglefowl was also involved.\n\nThe Sri Lanka Junglefowl is the National Bird of Sri Lanka.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Fuse ODG (aka Richard Abiona) is undoubtedly the most successful artist to date to emerge out of the Afrobeat scene and his forthcoming album looks set to add another incredible chapter to the Ghanaian South Londoner\u2019s all-conquering career. The past 12 months has seen Fuse ODG fast become a mainstream star, selling over a million records with four chart hits in as many singles to his name. He has been a near permanent fixture on the radio 1 playlist and achieved silver status on singles \u2018Antenna\u2019, \u2018Million Pound Girl\u2019 and \u2018Dangerous Love\u2019, which spent 10 consecutive weeks in the UK top 20. All in addition to collaborating with Sean Paul and Wyclef and a MOBO award win for Best African Act in 2013 and 2014.\n\nRecorded over the past year and created with the help of the industry\u2019s most in demand Afrobeats production houses such as award-winning Ghanaian producer Killbeatz, the album \u2018T.I.N.A\u2019 is an extraordinary body of work. An acronym for \u2018This Is New Africa\u2019, the title of the album and its musical content is a celebration of Fuse\u2019s love for his motherland, the Africa of Now. A sonic manifestation of Fuse\u2019s personality, each track is set to sit comfortably on radio airwaves and club dance floors and features the hit singles, alongside club smashes like \u2018Ye Play\u2019, soulful jams like \u2018Over\u2019 and the electro afro pop masterclass \u2018Beautiful Sunray\u2019 (featuring UK hip hop heavyweights Krept & Konan). Whilst \u2018This Girl\u2019 adds a final blow of pop genius with its standout infectious chorus creating a confident collection of afro-pop brilliance.\n\nGoing from strength to strength, 2014 will also see FUSE ODG tour the UK, with four headline slots throughout October. With a sold out headline show at The Garage in Islington and appearances at a string of festival dates under his belt he will kick off the tour at the renowned Under the Bridge venue in London, then unto Manchester Club Academy, and climaxing with a show at the Birmingham Library.", "title": "Fuse ODG - Thinking About You (ft.

Static electricity is simply an electrical charge built up on an insulated object, such as a balloon or your body. Since oppositely charged atoms are attracted to each other, objects with opposite static electricity fields cling together.\n\nA laser printer uses this phenomenon as a sort of \"temporary glue.\" The core component of this system is the photoreceptor, typically a revolving drum or cylinder. This drum assembly is made out of highly photoconductive material that is discharged by light photons.\nInitially, the drum is given a total positive charge by the charge corona wire, a wire with an electrical current running through it. (Some printers use a charged roller instead of a corona wire, but the principle is the same.) As the drum revolves, the printer shines a tiny laser beam across the surface to discharge certain points. In this way, the laser \"draws\" the letters and images to be printed as a pattern of electrical charges -- an electrostatic image. The system can also work with the charges reversed -- that is, a positive electrostatic image on a negative background.\n\nAfter the pattern is set, the printer coats the drum with positively charged toner -- a fine, black powder. Since it has a positive charge, the toner clings to the negative discharged areas of the drum, but not to the positively charged \"background.\" This is something like writing on a soda can with glue and then rolling it over some flour: The flour only sticks to the glue-coated part of the can, so you end up with a message written in powder.\n\nWith the powder pattern affixed, the drum rolls over a sheet of paper, which is moving along a belt below. Before the paper rolls under the drum, it is given a negative charge by the transfer corona wire (charged roller). This charge is stronger than the negative charge of the electrostatic image, so the paper can pull the toner powder away. Since it is moving at the same speed as the drum, the paper picks up the image pattern exactly. To keep the paper from clinging to the drum, it is discharged by the detac corona wire immediately after picking up the toner.\nFinally, the printer passes the paper through the fuser, a pair of heated rollers. As the paper passes through these rollers, the loose toner powder melts, fusing with the fibers in the paper. The fuser rolls the paper to the output tray, and you have your finished page. The fuser also heats up the paper itself, of course, which is why pages are always hot when they come out of a laser printer or photocopier.", "title": "Working of Laser Printer", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T06:45:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "2dRr-fnPCwM", "description": "What was the 2012 Nobel Prize in physics given for?

Based on 30+ years of face to face interactions with actual clients. \n\nBook Reviews:\n\n(1) Hi Mr. Pierre! I recently read your book and found it to be well written and extremely helpful! In fact, I've now recommended it to everyone I know. Recently, our agents had a study group meeting based on your book and many of them are having their teams read the book also. It's definitely a quick read that drives home the importance of the products we sell, as well as effective strategies for helping our clients! Thanks also for writing such a great book!\n\n(2) 9-13-13: Increase Your Insurance Sales, Retention & Referrals Now!!! (Paperback) \nLogical and clear - Honest and Ethical. Reading this is as though the author is sitting right next to you, advising you about how to approach clients, with respect and certainty, as he has done for decades. One of the aspects of this book is how the ethics of providing the security of income to a family with life insurance products, intertwines with one's own good moral objectives. Great book, thanks! \n                                   \n(3) I have read most books on insurance sales. I have attended several seminars and have lots of training in insurance sales, this is the best book on the subject. I even bought this book twice and now use it as my business plan! If you plan on making a career in insurance sales, this is the only book you need.\n\n(4) Last night I had the opportunity to read an AWESOME insurance sales book. Not only did the author give you practical steps on how to improve your sales, he also shared his overwhelming passion for what he does. Through his shared examples, he reminds us of why the insurance business is one where you can truly impact not only an individual but also the generations to come. This is a MUST read for anyone in insurance - a great handbook for the newbie, and a re-igniter for those of us who have been in the business for awhile. Hat's off to the author and his ability to bring it home!!!!\n\n(5) Michael L. Agent, Louisiana, September 26, 2013 \nBy Michael Lizanna (Slidell, LA United States) - Amazon Verified Purchase \nThis review is from: Increase Your Insurance Sales, Retention & Referrals Now!!! (Paperback) \nThank you for writing a wonderful book. It is inspiring for the new agent as well as a veteran agent. Your approach to selling life insurance is so simple, but powerful. I think anyone that would like to sell more life insurance should make the investment, because if you sell one policy you made all of your money back.\nBut if you follow the plan, and reach your goal, you will sell over 100.\n\nThanks again!\n\nML \n\nContact Information For Speaking Engagements, Training Sessions, Sales Training,  Cross Selling Techniques, Face To Face Training In Agencies: melvin.pierre@yahoo.com", "title": "Melvin Pierre -LIVE Training Session-Overcoming Objections While Selling Life Insurance", "publishedDate": "2012-03-25T00:20:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "2d__kyS-1FE", "description": "In this video I review the Poetic GraphGrip Galaxy Note 8.0 Case.

Suas folhas s\u00e3o longas, achatadas como espadas, com margens denteadas, e dispostas em espiral entorno do caule lenhoso e pouco ramificado. Destaque tamb\u00e9m para as ra\u00edzes a\u00e9reas, que emergem calibrosas diretamente do caule, acima do solo e apresentam fun\u00e7\u00e3o de sustenta\u00e7\u00e3o da planta.

It is one of the four sacred months of the year. Since the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, Muharram moves from year to year when compared with the Gregorian calendar.\nMuharram is derived from the word haraam, meaning \"sinful\". It is held to be the most sacred of all the months, excluding Ramadan. Some Muslims fast during these days. The tenth day of Muharram is the Day of Ashura, which to Shia Muslims is part of the Mourning of Muharram.\nAzadari procession carried out by Shiite Muslims in Indian city of Hardoi on the Day of Ashura. Some Muslims fast during this day, because it is recorded in the hadith[citation needed] that Musa (Moses) and his people obtained a victory over the Egyptian Pharaoh on the 10th day of Muharram; accordingly Islamic prophet Muhammad asked Muslims to fast on this day that is Ashura and on a day before that is 9th so that they are not similar to Jews (since, according to him, Jews used to fast for one day due to the same reason, and many practices recorded in the hadith are specifically performed to avoid any apparent similarity to those of contemporary neighbouring Jews and Christians).\nMuharram is a month of remembrance & Modern Shia Meditation that is often considered synonymous with the event of Ashura. Ashura, which literally means the \"Tenth\" in Arabic, refers to the tenth day of Muharram. It is well-known because of historical significance and mourning for the martyrdom of Hussein ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad.\nShias start the mourning from the 1st night of Muharram and continue for two months and eight days. However the last days are the most important since these were the days where Hussein and his family and followers (consisting of 72 people, including women, children and aged people) were killed by army of Yazid I at the Battle of Karbala on his orders. Surviving members of the family of Hussein and that of his followers were taken captive and marched to Damascus and imprisoned there.\nSource:Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

In a typical procedure, the foreskin is opened and then separated from the glans after inspection. The circumcision device (if used) is placed, and then the foreskin is removed. Topical or locally injected anesthesia may be used to reduce pain and physiologic stress.[5] For adults, general anesthesia is an option, and the procedure is often performed without a specialized circumcision device. Circumcision may be indicated for both therapeutic and prophylactic reasons. It is a treatment option for phimosis, balanoposthitis and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs);[2][6] it is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.[3][6]\nA 2009 Cochrane meta-analysis of studies done on sexually active men in Africa found that circumcision reduces the infection rate of HIV among heterosexual men by 38--66% over a period of 24 months,[7] and studies have concluded it is cost-effective against HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.[8] Circumcision reduces the incidence of HSV-2 infections by 28%,[9] and is associated with reduced HPV prevalence[a] and a reduced risk of both UTIs and penile cancer.[5] Studies of its protective effects against other sexually transmitted infections have been inconclusive. A 2010 review of literature worldwide found circumcisions performed by medical providers to have a median complication rate of 1.5% for newborns and 6% for older children, with few severe complications.] Bleeding, infection and the removal of either too much or too little foreskin are the most common complications cited. Circumcision does not appear to have a negative impact on sexual function.[b]\nThe origin of circumcision is not known with certainty; the oldest documentary evidence for it comes from ancient Egypt. Various theories have been proposed as to how it began, including as a religious sacrifice and as a rite of passage marking a boy's entrance into adulthood. Circumcision is most often elected for religious reasons or personal preferences;[1] it is considered religious law in Judaism[19] and is an established practice in Islam, Coptic Christianity and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church[1][20][21] to circumcise sons. It is estimated that one-third of males worldwide are circumcised.[1][14] Circumcision is most prevalent in the Muslim world and Israel (where it is near-universal), the United States and parts of Southeast Asia and Africa; it is relatively rare in Europe, Latin America, parts of Southern Africa and most of Asia.[1]\nEthical and legal questions regarding informed consent and autonomy have been raised over non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision.[22][23] The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends considering circumcision as part of a comprehensive HIV program in areas with high endemic rates of HIV, such as sub-Saharan Africa.[8][24] The positions of the world's other major medical organizations range from considering neonatal circumcision as having a modest net health benefit that outweighs small risks to viewing it as having no benefit with significant risks for harm. No major medical organization recommends either universal circumcision for all infant males or banning the procedure.", "title": "Rabbi Ovadia Yosef participate in circumcision", "publishedDate": "2013-01-22T14:07:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "2e1jR-pvj54", "description": "Fools Dance was a short-lived British rock band, formed in 1982 by Simon Gallup after he left The Cure, due to a conflict with Robert Smith.[1] Initially calling themselves 'The Cry', the band played their first gig at the Covent Garden Rock Garden on the 19th April 1983.

Born in Boston, Edwards married an Iranian while still at art school and settled in Tehran, returning to Europe on the break-up of her marriage. This stunning monograph, including 187 superb colour reproductions, covers her painting as she moves from early figurative studies such as the haunting \"Valley of Sils\", 1972, towards the pure abstraction of such gorgeous watercolours as \"Black Sun\", 1990. The Iranian influence of kaleidoscopic colours and intricate patterning is very apparent in abstract work such as \"Carpet Bazaar\", 1995, or \"Checkered Mountain\", 1996, suggesting the influence of Klee, Kandinsky and Matisse. The grid pattern paradoxically liberated Edwards and the early flower studies with their intense saturated hue became the brilliantly imagined watercolour fantasias which made her international reputation. In the past ten years she has moved away from formulaic figuration and fantasy into a looser, more gestural style, finding colour forms through the organic flow of the liquid medium in works such as \"Kenyan Quiet\" and \"Abstract in Scarlet and Yellow\". In addition to the 187 reproductions, there is a signed lithographic print from an edition of 500 included with the book. 190pp, large format, 187 colour plates, signed print, exhibitions, biography.^ \n\nPublished Price: \u00a355.00 \nBIBLIOPHILE PRICE: \u00a320.00", "title": "'Sylvia Edwards' Bibliophile Book Review", "publishedDate": "2011-03-09T10:35:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "2e5E4KSTgPU", "description": "my sons jake and nicol anderson tying on discs of a clean ground net in our gear shed in skeld shetland, the net is for the fidelitas LK45. the net is for catching flatfish and monkfish it is a fairly low net. for use on the edges of the clean and the clean.", "title": "trawl net rigging, tying on discs of a clean ground trawl net", "publishedDate": "2011-06-12T14:22:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "2e5a2xmNkZo", "description": "\u990c\u3092\u904b\u3073\u5165\u308c\u3066\u7a74\u3092\u57cb\u3081\u3066\u3044\u308b\u6240\u306e\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u571f\u3092\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u56e3\u5b50\u306b\u3057\u3066\u7a74\u306b\u5165\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u4f55\u56de\u3053\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u7e70\u308a\u8fd4\u3059\u306e\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff1f\n\u6c17\u304c\u9060\u304f\u306a\u308a\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002", "title": "\u7a74\u3092\u57cb\u3081\u308b\u30b8\u30ac\u30d0\u30c1", "publishedDate": "2013-05-21T13:24:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2e5qfcbtfEI", "description": "Jim Carrey Wishes He Was Younger So He Could Chop Down Emma Stone And Have Little Freckle Face Chubby Lumpkin Babies", "title": "Jim Carrey confesses his love for Emma Stone!!", "publishedDate": "2011-08-25T20:04:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2e6693CCYKE", "description": "SEXY BY SWEDEN\nhttp://sexybysweden.com/\n\nProudly presents\n\nSHAKE YOUR ASS!\n\nDanny Saucedo feat Lazee by Bingo Rim\u00e9r\n\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n\nJamilla Idris - Top Model\nhttp://jamilla.se/\n\nDessie\nhttp://werun.se/desireenilsson/\n\nPaow\nhttp://www.paow.se/\n\nKatrin Zytomierska\nhttp://finest.se/katrin\n\nNicoline Artursson - Miss World Sweden\nhttp://blogg.improveme.se/missworldsweden/\n\nEllen Bergstr\u00f6m\nhttp://www.finest.se/milady\n\nSaga Scott\nhttp://sexy.se/saga/\n\nJenny Hammarlund - Top Model\nhttp://jennyhammarlund.se/", "title": "Danny Saucedo feat Lazee - Shake That Ass - by Bingo Rim\u00e9r", "publishedDate": "2012-06-16T08:33:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "2e6IYGbtCJw", "description": "Yet again, I covered another one of my favorite Doors songs. \n\n Enjoy!\n\n I apologize for my lack of uploads...

It experienced the greatest demand at the time of the two World Wars, when molybdenum alloys rendered maximum stability and temperature resistance to the armoured conduits. On the other hand, the element is considered to be hypersensitive - even impurities of one ten-thousandth of a percent of oxygen may render pure molybdenum very brittle.\n \nHowever, this did not tarnish the popularity of the element: Its outstanding features find a variety of applications in the industrialised world. Even some 230 years after its discovery, molybdenum is still categorically considered to be an industry metal. The high melting point, good heat resistance and its excellent conductivity are perfect for superalloys and for the manufacture of hard heat-resistant steel. It is found in valves and turbine blades of the aerospace industry as well as in the chemical industry; in drills and milling machines as well as catalysts for the petroleumprocessing plants. In addition, the metal is insensitive to the impact of reducing acids. Is it a true \u201ecase of hardship\"? Not only that: in powder form or blended with oil, the raw material withstands extreme pressures and temperatures, making it a high-performance lubricant of a special class.\n \nThis should bring good news to the People's Republic of China in particular: It is home to 38 percent of the reserves and the same percentage of the total production worldwide, which makes it the global market leader in both areas. Other large reserves are found in the U.S. and Chile, which also assume the places one and two in the production numbers. Total of around 200,000 tonnes are produced worldwide, almost 30 percent of demand met by recycling - thus, no reason to build any more muzzles.\n \nFor more information, visit: www.swissmetal.net", "title": "MOLYBDENUM - Swissmetal Inc.", "publishedDate": "2013-07-18T17:16:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "2e9pQKqdV3U", "description": "Recorded at the 2014 Rosebud Fair.", "title": "138th Rosebud Fair Little Bighorn Victory Dance", "publishedDate": "2014-08-27T22:13:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "2e9tJSss80s", "description": "UPON LOGIC\n(Peter Riden)\n\nThe reason to be here\nNotion of existence\nBravery or fear\n\nCerebral reasoning\nFaithful or rightful\nWhich way of being\n\nShall we figure out\n What's right over wrong\nUpon Logic - no way to deny\nShall you turn me down\n Blinded moralizing\nUpon Logic - delight is the height\n Aiming for eternal peace\n Surging love ever more\n\nInformative or technical\nKnowledge and facts\nHow far beyond\n\nAbsolute versus naught\nMacro to micro state\nSupreme concept\n\nShall you know the future\n Foretold and hopeful\nUpon Logic - the right results bright\nShall we get together\n Dismissing pretension\nUpon Logic - rise up the truthful\n Feel the life's energy\n Everlasting desire\n No negation to survive\n And be happy everafter\n\n\n\nMusic and Lyrics \nPETER RIDEN\nRiden' Stars Music - BMI\n\nAlbum: Long Awaited\n1986\n\nThe Musical and Humanist Advent: Concept was a progressive rock group located in \nLaval, Canada.\n\nFor more about Concept please check -\n\nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/user/Suprasurge\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Concept/829107797105250?ref=hl\n\nEmail Peter Riden: affiliat@the-grand-barn.com", "title": "Concept - Upon Logic", "publishedDate": "2014-02-16T10:34:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2e9tlIjNw1Q", "description": "Sonic Soundboard", "title": "Sonic Soundboard", "publishedDate": "2014-01-11T08:55:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "2eAH0UpARkE", "description": "Rain Soul - Try FREE Rain Soul Samples http://tryrainsoulsamples.com and Learn More About This Amazing Product and Opportunity Now!

A bitmap image uses a grid of individual pixels where each pixel can be a different color or shade.\n\n \n\nIve opened up the Stickergiant logo in Adobe Photoshop. From a distance it looks like a smooth and clean image. But as you zoom in you can see it is made of small pixels.  This is a raster image.\n\n \n\nVector graphics use mathematical relationships between points and paths, connecting them to describe an image.\n\n \n\nHere is a vectorized stickergiant logo, opened in adobe illustrator. If I click on it. You can see that it is made up of little dot to dots with little paths. this is the big difference between raster and vector art. \n\nBeing that is mathematically built with little points and paths you can resize the image to any size without loosing detail.  This is usually the best format to submit if you want great quality artwork.\n\n\nSo here is a side to side just so you can see the difference better. The one on the left is vector and the one on the right is raster. They are both zoomed in around 400% and you can see that the vector image is still smooth. The raster image is only 300 dpi, which is standard for printing, but if you have access to a higher quality image raster is always great because of its photo editing abilities. \n\n\nNow you know the difference between raster and vector art.\n\nFind out more on our blog: http://www.stickergiant.com/blog/raster-vs-vector-what-does-it-all-mean/.", "title": "Raster vs. Vector What Does It All Mean?", "publishedDate": "2010-02-04T22:12:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "2eMJ6ZDCAp4", "description": "Just as we need daily physical sustenance, the need for daily spiritual sustenance is just as strong. For the Children of Israel, manna was a daily reminder of the source of their blessings; today, we can remember Jesus Christ every day as we pray, read the scriptures, and meditate. (Part 1 of 3) http://mormonchannel.org/mormon-messages\n\n(Voice of Elder D. Todd Christofferson)  I think it's not by chance God has created us in a way that we have to have daily physical sustenance.  The Children of Israel coming out of Egypt lived for forty years, approximately, on something called manna.  They couldn't have lived from hunting, and their lifestyle was such that they couldn't be planting, so they really didn't have an alternative.  God was in essence providing their daily sustenance.  And I think at least one of His purposes was to teach them to remember Him, to think of Him, to look to Him, to have faith in Him, that He was the source of their life. He did in the way of making it a daily thing; they couldn't gather up manna and store it, it would only be good for one day.  They couldn't forget who was the source their blessings.  There's a spiritual parallel in our day.  We all recognize the need for physical sustenance; hunger and thirst remind us very strongly if we forget.  But the spiritual need for sustenance is equally strong, that comes not in drinking water and eating food but in our constant daily efforts of communion with God.  We ought not to think that we can go weeks and months without spiritual sustenance and not suffer, and not have a deadening influence in our spiritual life.  Acknowledging the reality of our need for a daily spiritual ministration, or manna, helps us increase in our courage to do the right thing, and to serve others, more than we would have if we ignored God.  People sometimes think \"Well, those are such small things; prayer, immersing ourselves in the scriptures, pondering, meditating; how can that really produce a significant difference in a person's life?\"  But it does. As small as those things seem to be, as daily, routine sometimes they may seem to be, these are the kinds of things that day by day, transform us.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints", "title": "Daily Bread: Pattern", "publishedDate": "2013-09-06T18:37:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "2eMdXYEJqv8", "description": "Music video by Desaparecidos performing Fiesta Loca.

They comprise 15 extant species in seven genera (another species became extinct in the 1950s) and are commonly known either as sea lions or fur seals, distinct from true seals (phocids) and the walrus (odobenids). Otariids are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, feeding and migrating in the water, but breeding and resting on land or ice. They reside in subpolar, temperate, and equatorial waters throughout the Pacific and Southern Oceans and the southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans. They are conspicuously absent in the north Atlantic. The words 'otariid' and 'otary' come from the Greek otarion meaning \"little ear\", referring to the small but visible external ear flaps (pinnae) which can be used to distinguish them from the phocids. Otariids have proportionately much larger foreflippers and pectoral muscles than phocids, and have the ability to turn their hind limbs forward and walk on all fours, making them far more maneuverable on land. They are generally considered to be less adapted to an aquatic lifestyle, since they breed primarily on land and haul out more frequently than true seals. However, they can attain higher bursts of speed and greater maneuverability in the water. Their swimming power derives from the use of flippers more so than the sinuous whole-body movements typical of phocids and walruses.\nOtariids are further distinguished by a more dog-like head, sharp, well-developed canines, and the aforementioned visible external pinnae. Their postcanine teeth are generally simple and conical in shape. Sea lions are covered with coarse guard hairs, while fur seals have a thick underfur, which have historically made them the objects of commercial exploitation. Male otariids range in size from the 70-kg (150-lb) Gal\u00e1pagos fur seal, smallest of all pinnipeds, to the over 1000-kg (2200-lb) Steller sea lion. Mature male otariids weigh two to six times more than females, with proportionately larger heads, necks, and chests, making them the most sexually dimorphic of all mammals. All otariids breed on land during well-defined breeding seasons. Except for the Australian sea lion, which has an atypical 17.5 month breeding cycle, they form strictly annual aggregations on beaches or rocky substrates, often on islands. All species are polygynous; i.e.. successful males breed with several females. In most species, males arrive at breeding sites first and establish and maintain territories through vocal and visual displays and occasional fighting. Females typically arrive on shore a day or so before giving birth. While considered social animals, no permanent hierarchies or statuses are established on the colonies. The extent to which males control females or territories varies between species. Thus, the northern fur seal and the South American sea lion tend to herd specific harem-associated females, occasionally injuring them, while the Steller sea lion and the New Zealand sea lion control spatial territories, but do not generally interfere with the movement of the females. Otariids are carnivorous, feeding on fish, squid and krill. Sea lions tend to feed closer to shore in upwelling zones feeding on larger fish, while the smaller fur seals tend to take longer, offshore foraging trips and can subsist on large numbers of smaller prey items. They are visual feeders and some females are capable of dives up to 400 m (1300 ft). Along with the Phocidae and Odobenidae, the two other members of Pinnipedia, Ot\u0430riidae are descended from a common ancestor most closely related to modern bears. Debate remains as to whether the phocids diverged from the otariids before or after the walrus. Otariids arose in the late Miocene (10-12 million years ago) in the North Pacific, diversifying rapidly into the Southern Hemisphere, where most species now live. Callorhinus (northern fur seal) has the oldest fossil record of any extant otariid, extending to the middle Pliocene, and probably arose from the extinct fur seal Thalassoleon. Traditionally, otariids had been subdivided into the fur seal (Arctocephalinae) and sea lion (Otariinae) subfamilies, with the major distinction between them being the presence of a thick underfur layer in the former. Under this categorization, the fur seals comprised two genera: Callorhinus in the North Pacific with a single representative, the northern fur seal (C. ursinus) and eight species in the Southern Hemisphere under the genus Arctocephalus, while the sea lions comprise five species under five genera. Recent analyses of the genetic evidence suggests that the Callorhinus ursinus is in fact more closely related to several sea lion species.", "title": "Eared seals, Caleta Vald\u00e9s, Peninsula Valdes, Chubut Province, Argentina, South America", "publishedDate": "2014-01-17T23:19:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2e_PI1uVPGo", "description": "Rorschach girl in the wagon with Danny.", "title": "Rorschach and her boys", "publishedDate": "2012-09-26T16:40:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2e_hDMVS0Sc", "description": "", "title": "Bonnet Macaques Confront Bird of Prey In Tamil Nadu", "publishedDate": "2011-02-23T21:58:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "2e_pxuz-wjQ", "description": "La Comisi\u00f3n Europea desmiente a Montoro: nunca autorizaron el c\u00e9ntimo sanitario tal y como afirm\u00f3 el ministro de Hacienda.

In question there are the alleged devastating effects caused by the publication of the book 'A Verdade da Mentira' [The Truth of the Lie], written by Gon\u00e7alo Amaral, in her family life and in the searches for Maddie that have [subsequently] ceased.\n \nIn the session two witnesses were heard, called by Kate's defence, a psychologist and a lawyer. Seated in an enormous bench, spaced with 10 meters of emptiness between them, Kate and Gon\u00e7alo Amaral never looked at each other. But Kate McCann, during one of the morning breaks, managed to see on his way out of the courtroom the former PJ inspector signing a book at the request of an elderly man that was there following the session.\n \n\n Santos de Oliveira, Gon\u00e7alo Amaral's lawyer, also signed the book at the request of the elderly man. Minutes later, the lawyer, on his way out of Pal\u00e1cio da Justi\u00e7a, gave an impromptu press conference. He said he would only talk because Kate McCann had done so outside the court session on Thursday.(SEE MORE ON WEBSITE)\nhttp://joana-morais.blogspot.com/2013/09/defence-for-goncalo-amaral-goes-on.html", "title": "McCLIP: Gon\u00e7alo Amaral's lawyer gives press conference at McCann v Amaral TRIAL Sept 13 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-09-15T05:56:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "2exIyWGLPsU", "description": "", "title": "corcha vs vegas", "publishedDate": "2010-05-02T03:18:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "2exflof9Z0E", "description": "Leanne McClurg Cambric\nStill Breath\n\nApril Hammock\nRecent Works\n\nAmy James\nReflection\n\nJune 28-July 30, 2009\n\nwww.batonrougegallery.org", "title": "July 2009 Exhibitioin Cambric, Hammock and James", "publishedDate": "2009-07-11T17:38:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ey9TlsU2ZU", "description": "2023 Tattler Dr, Cedar Park, TX 78613", "title": "2023 Tattler Dr, Cedar Park, TX 78613", "publishedDate": "2013-05-16T19:20:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "2eyTbc5Ar7k", "description": "Ruususen unta", "title": "Inka - Ruususen unta", "publishedDate": "2007-02-07T20:17:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ey_mehpja8", "description": "After getting defeated by his dad Spike last night!Tike decides to go in the Kitchen to find something to eat until Butch came & said:I won't let you have any food unless you defeat me in a battle!Then Tike Decide he will like to battle him!Will Tike win?I play as Tike & i take on Butch!Enjoy!", "title": "Tom & Jerry in Fists of Furry:Tike Vs.

Burkhardt's keynote presentation at the conference \"Improving Medication Safety Through Effective Communication and Teamwork.\"\n\nPatient safety experts have long agreed that medication errors are the single most frequent source of preventable error. Additionally, creating a culture of patient safety requires strong teamwork and effective communication between healthcare providers, yet there is often not enough attention devoted to developing these skills.\n\nThe NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) and CIR's Policy and Education Initiative (PEI) sponsored the one-day conference on November 30, 2011, bringing together 160 healthcare professionals from all 11 hospitals in the HHC system. The conference focused on a team and systems-based approach to reducing medication errors, with emphasis on the use of opioid and effective pain management. It was co-sponsored by 1199 SEIU and funded by the Federal Medication and Conciliation Service and the CIR Patient Care Trust Fund.\n\nMary E. Burkhardt, MS, RPh, FASHP is the Chief of Pharmacy Service at Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Healthcare System and a Medical Safety Consultant at Medication Safety Solutions.

Both species are very similar and possess venomous spines along their fins. We meet specimens across various dive sites near Phuket, at Richelieu Rock, and at Black Rock in the Mergui Archipelago.\n\nOther species that are included are the zebra lionfish, Dendrochirus zebra, the rare frillfin turkeyfish, Pterois mombasae, and the spotfin lionfish, Pteroid antennata.\n\nWe then look at the crown-of-thorns starfish, or crown-of-thorns sea star, Acanthaster planci, which also has stinging, venomous spines on its body that contain a neuro-toxin intended to cause paralysis. This starfish feeds on hard corals and human intervention has been required in some parts of the world where these starfish threatened to destroy enitre reef systems.\n\nFinally we examine sea urchins, specifically the black longspine urchin, Diadema setosum, which is prevalent across the Andaman Sea. We see a large colony of them at Racha Yai Island, near Phuket in Thailand.\n\nThe following closed captions/subtitles are available by clicking the CC button under the video:\n\nNARRATION / COMMENTARY:\n- English\n- German (Deutscher Kommentar)\n- Spanish (Narraci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1ol)\n\nMARINE LIFE & DIVE SITE NAMES\n- Dutch (Nederlandse Namen)\n- English\n- German (Deutsche Bezeichnungen)\n- Thai ( \u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 & \u0e08\u0e38\u0e14\u0e14\u0e33\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33 )\n\nPlease get in touch with me if you would like to help translate the narration or marine life names into other languages.\n\nThanks to Erik Verkoyen for the music track, \"Black Corals\".\n\nI have more scuba diving videos and underwater footage on my website at:\nhttp://www.bubblevision.com\n\nI post updates about my videos, and interesting underwater videos from other filmmakers here:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/bubblevision\nhttp://www.twitter.com/nicholashope\n\nThe video was shot by Nick Hope with a Sony VX2000 DV camera in a Gates housing.

(FIG) of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky. The idea for the project originated with Edwin Kagin and he and his wife Helen served as Camp Directors for the first ten years of the original Camp Quest, retiring at the end of the 2005 camp session.\n\n\u2022 http://www.camp-quest.org\n\nCamp Quest UK is the first residential summer camp for the children of atheists, agnostics, humanists, freethinkers and all those who embrace a naturalistic rather than supernatural world view.\n\n2009 will be our first year of camp, and we will be the first Camp Quest to operate outside of North America, where there are currently six successful branches.\n\nWe aim to provide summer camping holidays and trips that focus on our childrens needs - physical and mental activity, and a lot of fun! As well as the more traditional outdoor activities - canoeing, climbing, zip wire, high ropes - our enthusiastic and knowledgeable counsellors will lead the children on a variety of activities which could concern anything from critical thinking and logical fallacies, to the scientific method and pseudoscience, philosophy, ethics, famous freethinkers and world religions!\n\nChildren at Camp Quest aren't required to be atheists. We want to encourage children to think for themselves and to evaluate the world critically and thus draw their own conclusions. However, parents should be aware that we adopt a critical, scientific approach as opposed to a faith-based approach. At Camp Quest, children arent taught that There is no god. Instead, they are taught to come to their own conclusions, but more importantly, that Its OK not to believe in a god.\n\nWe believe that the positive influence of Camp Quest UK will help to develop children into happy, healthy and respectful adults.\n\n\u2022 http://www.camp-quest.org.uk\n.", "title": "Camp Quest - Secular Summer Camp For Children", "publishedDate": "2009-07-29T15:31:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "2fIlT_IfTBQ", "description": "SUBSCRIBE for more stuff like this! :-)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=thesamtsui\nSAM TSUI + Kurt Hugo Schneider - ASIA TOUR 2014\nKuala Lumpur - June 21 - Link coming soon!!\nManila - June 25 - https://www.smtickets.com/event/details?event_id=2424\nManila - June 26 - https://www.smtickets.com/event/details?event_id=2425\nSingapore - June 27 - http://www.sistic.com.sg/events/sam0614\nHong Kong - June 29 - http://venue.cityline.com/utsvInternet/internet/action/event.do?actionFwd=eventDetail&event=10075\nShanghai - July 1 - Link coming soon!!\nBeijing - July 2 - Link coming soon!!\nTaipei - July 3 - http://ticket.7net.com.tw/index.php?class=order&func=allgenki&game_id=62283&category=ibon\nIn what's become a yearly tradition for us, Kurt and I took a whole bunch of the most popular songs from this year and combined them into this single arrangement - can you pick out all your favorites?

It can be painful and frustrating to endure. In most cases, it is caused by either a nutrient deficiency or an infection or sometimes both.\n\nCases caused by a nutritional deficiency are easily cleared up by taking supplements or changing your diet to include more foods rich in the missing nutrient. Very often, the culprit is a lack of one or more B vitamins. In part because they are water soluble, a deficiency or borderline deficiency in B vitamins can happen quite easily and is far more common than most people think. Additionally, some people see results from getting more vitamin C. It is readily available from citrus fruits like oranges. Others benefit from oils rich in Omega-3 fatty acids such as fish oil, flax seed oil or walnut oil. You can get these in supplement form or through foods.\n\nCases caused by infection are sometimes due to either fungal infection or viral infection. Neither of these types of infection is treatable with antibiotics. In fact, antibiotics can make some fungal infections worse. For example, yeast infections are notorious for getting worse when taking antibiotics. Fungal infections need to be treated with anti-fungals.
