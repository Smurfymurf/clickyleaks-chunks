It efficiently simulates the growth and death of life forms in an arena, fighting to become the dominant race. This relatively complex behavior is simply simulated by running our generic implementation of Gaussian Convolution on a newly defined numeric data type LifeForm. Such a LifeForm consists of a name (i.e. its race) and a weight representing its population at a spot and specialized math operations addition and multiplication were defined to reflect their behavior.\n\nIn each round every LifeForm of every race grows by a certain percentage and dies of hunger if a spot is overpopulated. Each race at each spot tries to spread into their local neighborhood, trying to invade new space. If a neighboring spot is empty they will simply occupy it and start growing. If the same race is present in their vicinity, their population simply adds up. If another race is present they will fight for the spot. The race with the highest population at this spot will survive, however it will decrease by the amount of population the defeated race had lost. Occasionally, an epidemic will kill 90% of the dominant race to keep the simulation in balance.\nThe Game-of-Death was implemented together with with Stephan Saalfeld.\n\nTo read more about this simulation, please read the supplementary information of our ImgLib2 publication in Bioinformatics: http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/22/3009.long", "title": "Game Of Death (ImgLib2-based Simulation)", "publishedDate": "2013-10-12T14:46:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "3cFGsqq2H6I", "description": "", "title": "What is Rhodium Plating?", "publishedDate": "2012-07-03T21:39:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "3cFIjsEsZ0o", "description": "", "title": "London Harinama 16", "publishedDate": "2012-02-13T20:45:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "3cFq2lOEsd0", "description": "In Malaysia, residents of Mergong District in Kedah, would organize a festival each year, to celebrate the birthday of the nine emperor gods, at the beginning of the 9th lunar month.

Footage shows the Ostend Spirit heading to the shore, before scraping to a standstill between two boats. The vessel had been retired by its owners, and was coming to rest for the last time at the ship-breaking yard in Aliaga, Turkey, where it will later be taken apart. The ship, formerly known as The Pride of Calais, served as a channel ferry for P&O Ferries, travelling between Dover and Calais for 22 years until 2012.

Cela s'explique par la raison suivante: Si une chose a toujours exist\u00e9, elle n'a donc pas besoin de cr\u00e9ateur.\n \nPensons a l'ordinateur avec lequel vous utilisez en ce moment afin de lire cet article. Si votre ordinateur a toujours exist\u00e9, il n'aurait pas eu besoin de cr\u00e9ateur.\n \nMaintenant, imaginez un tireur d'arm\u00e9e (sniper) qui a r\u00e9p\u00e9r\u00e9 sa cible, mais doit communiquer avec sa radio pour avoir la permission de tirer. La personne qui se trouve a la base militaire dit au tireur d'attendre un instant en attendant qu'elle demande la permission d'un commandant sup\u00e9rieur. Le commandant sup\u00e9rieur doit demander a une personne d'un grade encore plus haut, et ainsi de suite, sans jamais s'arr\u00eater... le tireur atteindra-t-il un jour sa cible?\n \nLa r\u00e9ponse flagrante est NON, il ne tirera jamais.\n \nLe seul moyen pour que le tireur tire est qu'il y a quelqu'un au bout de cette cha\u00eene qui a l'autorit\u00e9 supr\u00eame et finale afin de donner l'autorisation.\n \nDe la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que Dieu a cr\u00e9\u00e9 l'Univers, si nous demandons qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 Dieu? Puis qu'ensuite, nous demandons qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le cr\u00e9ateur de Dieu, et le cr\u00e9ateur du cr\u00e9ateur, et ainsi de suite... il n'y aura donc pas d'Univers de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que le tireur n'aura pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de tirer!\n \nCeci est une preuve logique et rationnelle que l'Univers a un Cr\u00e9ateur qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engendr\u00e9 - Dieu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisionnez et partagez la nouvelle s\u00e9rie:\n[J\u00c9SUS LE MUSULMAN: \u00c9pisode 1]\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0Qo_nqEEng\n\nI do not own this video.

It gained the most fame through Admiral FitzRoy who used a Storm Glass on the voyage in which he and Darwin traveled to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. As such, the instrument is sometimes called a 'FitzRoy Storm Glass'.\n\nDue to the use of vodka rather than pure ethanol and water, the proportions I use to make the Storm Glass in my video breaks somewhat from the traditional ratios, but the recipe is balanced to achieve the same effect as the original. Fortunately, the chemical solution does not require extreme precision to work properly.\n\nComposition:\nVodka, 100 Proof (50% Ethanol) - 300 mL\nCamphor - 28g (1oz)\nPotassium Nitrate - 10g\nAmmonium Chloride - 10g\n\nSome of these chemicals may be difficult to obtain in certain parts of the world, but if Camphor can be found it's possible that Potassium Nitrate or Ammonium Chloride could be substituted for other soluble salts, such as Sodium Chloride (I have not tested this).\n\nTo read a Storm Glass for weather prediction, here is a description from the book Pharmaceutical Formulas by Peter MacEwan, published in 1908:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\"The changes of the solution signify the following:\n\nClear liquid : Bright weather.\nCrystals at bottom : Thick air, frost in winter.\nDim liquid with small stars : Thunderstorms.\nLarge flakes : Heavy air, overcast sky, snow in winter.\nThreads in upper portion of liquid : Windy weather.\nSmall dots : Damp weather, fog.\nRising flakes which remain high : Wind in the upper air regions.\nSmall stars : In winter on bright, sunny days, snow in one or two days.\nThe higher the crystals rise in the glass tube in winter the colder it will be.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe crystals within a Storm Glass will dissolve and solidify all on their own as the temperature changes day to day. If you would like to start fresh with completely clear liquid and watch the crystals form rapidly, the glass can be placed in a bowl of warm water for 10 minutes to dissolve old crystals completely. Remember to loosen the lid before doing so to prevent excess pressure from building inside.\n\nFor further reading see:\nhttp://www.strangeapparatus.com/Stormglass.html\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_glass\n\nThanks for watching!

When deciding about your treatment, your doctor also considers your age, overall health, and quality of life.\n\nBladder cancer has a better chance of being treated successfully if it is found early.\n\nTreatment choices for bladder cancer may include:\n\nSurgery to remove the cancer. Surgery, either alone or along with other treatments, is used in more than 9 out of 10 cases.\n\nChemotherapy to destroy cancer cells using medicines. Chemotherapy may be given before or after surgery.\n\nRadiation therapy to destroy cancer cells using high-dose X-rays or other high-energy rays.\nRadiation therapy may also be given before or after surgery and may be given at the same time as chemotherapy.\n\nImmunotherapy . This treatment causes your body's natural defenses, known as your immune system, to attack bladder cancer cells.\n\nWhen you first find out that you have cancer, you may feel scared or angry. Or you may feel very calm. It's normal to have a wide range of feelings and for those feelings to change quickly. Some people find that it helps to talk about their feelings with family and friends.\n\nIf your emotional reaction to cancer gets in the way of your ability to make decisions about your health, it's important to talk with your doctor. Your cancer treatment center may offer psychological or financial services.

And then Oklahoma does their little run at the end and all of a sudden the doctor looks around and Kyle's gone.\n\n\"He's literally darted from the training room without telling the doctors, goes back on, looks at the coach and says 'I'm in,' walks back into the game, checks himself into the game.

There are two distinct cultural traditions of dragons: the European dragon, derived from European folk traditions and ultimately related to Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies, and the Chinese dragon, with counterparts in Japan, Korea and other East Asian countries.\n\nIn the early 20th century sculpture of the Norwegian artist Gustav Vigeland, inspired by Medieval art, dragons are a frequent theme\u2014as symbols of sin but also as a nature force, fighting against man.\n\nDragons and dragon motifs are featured in many works of modern literature, particularly within the fantasy genre. Prominent works depicting dragons include J.R.R. Tolkien's Silmarillion and The Hobbit, J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern, George R. R. Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire, and Christopher Paolini's tetralogy Inheritance Cycle.\n\nThe popular role playing game system Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) makes heavy use of dragons, and has served as inspiration for many other games' dragons. Though dragons usually serve as adversaries, they can be either good or evil, with their alignment being determined by their species. For example, a red dragon is evil and breathes fire.\n\nSome modern pseudo-biological accounts of dragons give them the generic name Draco, although the generic name Draco is used in real-world biology for a genus of small gliding agamid lizard.

Young talent Joey Dale adds his own distinctive elements bringing together a track, which looks set to head to the very top of the charts. As ever with a Revealed Recordings release the scenes leading DJs has seen this hammered out at clubs and festivals across the world and now rapidly be getting loads of radio airplay.

Madison, which solidified the judicial branch's authority to interpret and decide the law.  Though Justice Marshall's justification for the power of judicial review has received some criticism for being unclear, unnecessary to decide in this case, or not properly substantiated, this power has become one of the defining tools of the judicial branch.\n\n        After John Adams lost a reelection bid to Thomas Jefferson in 1800, Adams appointed several Federalist judges and justices of the peace before Jefferson took office along with an incoming congress that would be controlled by Democratic-Republicans.  Not all of these appointees, however, received their commissions before Thomas Jefferson was sworn in as president.  As a result, President Jefferson asked his Secretary of State not to deliver any remaining commissions.    \n          \n       William Marbury, who had been appointed as a justice of the peace in Washington D.C. but had not received his commission, decided to sue James Madison (then-Secretary of State) directly and originally in the Supreme Court to have his commission delivered.  Marbury argued that the Judiciary Act of 1789, gave the Supreme Court the original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus to compel public officials to act.  Therefore the Supreme Court simply needed to decide if Marbury had a vested right in his commission and was being denied that right.             \n\n      Justice Marshall, however, wrote an opinion that negated the need to answer that question.  Instead, Marshall argued that the Act of 1789 was unconstitutional because congress could not give the Supreme Court the power to issue writs of mandamus by original jurisdiction, because the Constitution did not allow for original jurisdiction in these types of cases.   \n\n       Justice Marshall, a Federalist himself, seemingly rules in favor of Thomas Jefferson by refusing to compel James Madison to deliver a commission to William Marbury.  However, the greater victory for Federalists was won by Justice Marshall, because his opinion established the broad power of judicial review to void acts of congress that violated the Constitution.", "title": "Marbury v.

Some fans ran onto the field to join the scuffles, while others threw objects from the stands.\n\nSerbian media say that the drone was controlled by the brother of the Albanian prime minister Edi Rama, from the VIP section. Reports that he was arrested at the stadium are unconfirmed. \n\n'Greater Albania' includes Kosovo, which contains a large Albanian population and used to be part of Serbia until its independence in 2008. The match was abandoned after 41 minutes, by which time neither side had yet scored a goal.

Indeed, continuing our commitment to ongoing research, in 2012 Reed Migraine Centers teamed with the Mayo Clinic, Duke University, and other top centers, and published the results of St. Jude's foundational multicenter study on \"Occipital Neurostimulation for Chronic Migraine\". Reed Migraine Centers has offices and partner physicians currently in Dallas, New York, Chicago, Miami and other metropolitan areas.\n\nFor those patients suffering from debilitating headaches and seeking migraine relief, Reed Migraine Centers invites you to view our other patient information videos on peripheral neurostimulation that we have made available at the Reed Migraine YouTube Channel at http://www.youtube.com/user/ReedMigraine.

The mill was seen in the opening scenes of David Selznick's 1937 movie classic \"Gone With The Wind\", and is believed to be the only remaining structure from the film. Admission to The Old Mill is free, and the hours of operation are from sunrise to sunset.\n\nThe Old Mill, also known as Pugh's Mill, was built in 1933 by Justin Matthews as a replica of an old-water-powered grist mill. The mill was designed to appear as if it belonged in Arkansas and had been here since the 1800s. It is made largely from tinted concrete work over steel and copper rods made to represent wood, iron or stone, and features sculptures by Mexican artist Senor Dionicio Rodriguez.\n\nThe Old Mill was nationally recognized in 1986 by being placed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was also presented with the Greater Little Rock Historic Preservation Award by the Quapaw Quarter Association.\n\nThe grist mill on the first floor dates back to 1828, and some mill rocks on the second floor came from the plantation of Tom Knoble, the grandfather of Tom Pugh, in whose honor the Mill is dedicated. There are also two original milestones from a road laid out more than 150 years ago by Jefferson Davis. Along this road, the Cherokee and Choctaw Indians traveled from the present town of Dardanelle into the Indian territory, now Oklahoma. In addition three sections of a wrought iron shaft were cut from the stern wheel of a passenger steamboat, which traveled the Arkansas River in the 1800's, are used in the mill.\n\nThe park is decorated with sculptures of toadstools, tree stumps, and several ornate bridges. Senor Dionico Rodriguez, a sculptor and artist from Mexico City, was responsible for all the details of each piece of concrete work made to represent wood, iron or stone, as well as the designing of the foot bridges and rustic seats. During the summer of 1991, Rodriguez's work at the Old Mill was renovated by the grandson of the original artist, Carlos Cortes\n\nThe Old Mill is often used for many outdoor activities including picnicking, relaxing, and even weddings or photo shoots. It is not unheard of for people to choose the Old Mill as a place to say their nuptials and many schools around North Little Rock have their school photos taken there.\n\nA lake stretches into the Lakewood neighborhood below the Old Mill. The architect for the mill and park was Frank Carmean, the artist was Senor Dionicio Rodriguez, and the builder was the Justin Matthews Company.\n\nThe Old Mill Park was originally christened the T. R. Pugh Memorial Mill in honor of Thomas R. Pugh, of Portland, Arkansas, a staunch friend and benefactor of Matthews. The Old Mill was given to the City of North Little Rock as a gift by the former Justin Matthews Company on May 24, 1976. Maintained and landscaped by the Pulaski County Master Gardeners and North Little Rock Parks & Recreation, the park includes a variety of tree species including Eastern Redbud, Black Locust, Post Oak, Northern Red Oak, White Oak, and Shortleaf Pine.\n\nAuthentic reproduction of an old water-powered grist mill; appears in the opening scene of the classic movie, \"Gone with the Wind,\" tour guides available by appointment; popular for outdoor weddings\n\nOld Mill, North Little Rock, AR\nLakeshore Drive and Fairway Avenue\nNorth Little Rock, AR 72116 \n\nNorth Little Rock Visitor's Bureau (501) 758-1424\n\nDirections: From I-40, take JFK Blvd. (Ark. 107) north to McCain Blvd.; turn right on McCain, then right on Lakeshore Drive.

When perched, they often bob their head and flick up their tail.\n\nThis kingfisher is about 17 cm long and is white with a black mask, a white super cilium and black breast bands. The crest is neat and the upper parts are barred in black. Several subspecies are recognized within the broad distribution. The nominate race is found in sub-Saharan Africa, extending into West Asia. A former subspecies syriaca is considered as merely a larger northern bird of the nominate species (following Bergmann's rule). Subspecies leucomelanura is found from Afghanistan east into India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Laos. The subspecies travancoreensis of the Western Ghats is darker with the white reduced. Subspecies C. r. insignis is found in Hainan and southeastern China and has a much larger bill. Males have a narrow second breast-band while females have a single broken breast band.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

I won't be too strict, but I need examples of your work on your channel ^^\n- This is not first come first serve\n- Blood/Gore is allowed (oBVIOUSLY)\n- Make it SCARY!!! Glitches, scary faces, maybe popups... have fun with it! Make it INTENSE!!!\n- I won't be too strict on the animation either, since I know that animatronics are pretty hard to draw, much less animate ^^; So if you plan on PMV'ing it, please don't be lazy about it. At LEAST have some blinking or small movement if you really are struggling with animating a full part of them. They aren't shown moving a lot in the game anyways, so you can take advantage of that ;) Also if you choose to use you/your oc as the guard, you should animate them!!!\n- Please don't make it so the guard is domestic over the canon bots, like the bots being scared of the guard if it is your oc. They aren't like that in the game, so they shouldn't be like that here. (I don't know, I just really dislike seeing that in fanart c': sorry)\n- Feel free to use headcanons about the \"Bite of '87,\" the characters, the murdered kids, and just the story itself in your part!\n- Change it up a bit! Make it from the animatronics perspective, or maybe a kid that went there in the past for his/her birthday, or put some camera shots in there! If you want to, you can have them lip sync some parts if you feel it fits.\n- Put a sendspace link in the description to your part, or send it to me. .mov or .mp4 format is preferred\n- You can use animatronic ocs if you wish, but the canon characters /are/ preferred. You can also present the guard as you/one of your ocs.\n- You can have a max of 2 parts, but you cant have 2 long parts. You can have a short and a long, or a short and a short, but not both long. Short = S Long = L\n- Try to make it as HD as you can! Widescreen (1280x720) is preferred\n- Say \"Swiggity Swooty\" in your comment so I'll know that you read the rules :~)\n\n(* means extension given, parts due within a month of the deadline)\n(~ means waiting for reply on extensions or drop outs)\n\nParts:\n\n(L)Intro.

Its fruit, which is also called watermelon, is a special kind referred to by botanists as a pepo, a berry which has a thick rind (exocarp) and fleshy center (mesocarp and endocarp). Pepos are derived from an inferior ovary, and are characteristic of the Cucurbitaceae. The watermelon fruit, loosely considered a type of melon \u2013 although not in the genus Cucumis \u2013 has a smooth exterior rind (usually green with dark green stripes or yellow spots) and a juicy, sweet interior flesh (usually deep red to pink, but sometimes orange, yellow, or white).\nLa past\u00e8que (Cucumis lanatus) est une plante herbac\u00e9e de la famille des Cucurbitac\u00e9es, originaire d'Afrique, largement cultiv\u00e9e pour ses gros fruits lisses, \u00e0 chair rouge, jaune, verd\u00e2tre ou blanche et \u00e0 graines noires ou rouges. Le terme d\u00e9signe \u00e9galement ce fruit. Le fruit p\u00e8se g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, \u00e0 maturit\u00e9, entre 5 et 20 kg. Il faut distinguer la past\u00e8que comestible (parfois appel\u00e9e \u00ab melon d'eau \u00bb en fran\u00e7ais ; anguria ou cocomero en Italie, karpouz en Turquie, melancia au Portugal et au Br\u00e9sil, sandia en Espagne, watermelon1 en anglais ou encore suika \u30b9\u30a4\u30ab\u3000au Japon) de la past\u00e8que \u00e0 confiture ou \u00ab citre \u00bb, non directement comestible.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes.

Zijn muziek is een combinatie van de populaire Salsa, Merengue, Zouk en nog vele andere Latin muziekstijlen maar vooral dansbare feestmuziek. Bij veel Salsa & Zumba danslessen wordt om deze reden veel gebruik gemaakt van zijn muziek!\n \nEdsel begon zijn muzikale carri\u00e8re al heel vroeg. Hij maakte dan ook tal van CD albums die op de Nederlandse Antillen grote hits werden en sleepte hierdoor vele prijzen in de wacht.\nIn de jaren negentig bereikte Edsel met het nummer Dal\u00e9 ku awa een mega hit, die 16 weken op nummer \u00e9\u00e9n stond. De lokale bevolking gaf dit lied de naam Payo en hierdoor kreeg Edsel \u00f3\u00f3k de bijnaam 'Payo'. Hij werd op Cura\u00e7ao gekozen tot de populairste artiest en ontving de prijs 'Ambassadeur van de Antilliaanse muziek in Nederland'. In Miami werd zijn werk At\u00e9 wega ook ontdekt. Hij  werd daarom uitgenodigd om van dit nummer een Spaanstalige versie genaamd Asi Asi met de groep Gemini op te nemen. Dit in samenwerking met Eddy Montilla, de producer van o.a. Conga van Gloria Estefan. Zijn allereerste passie om acteur te worden kon hij niet zomaar laten varen. Zo kreeg hij zijn eigen talkshow K\u00f2fi serka F\u00e8chi (op de koffie bij F\u00e8chi) op Cura\u00e7ao en Bonaire. In deze show ontvangt hij in de personage van F\u00e8chi gasten die in Nederland op artistiek- en andere werkgebieden een belangrijke rol spelen.\nEdsel Juliet & La Banda Loca!\n \nLet's Party!!!\nIn 2010 keert hij na een geslaagde muziektour op  Nederlandse Antillen terug in het land en besluit het dit jaar over een andere boeg  te gooien. Hij lanceert de album 'Let's Party' voor liefhebbers van Latin Caribische  feestmuziek. \nEdsel Juliet &  La Banda Loca is een veelgevraagde act, die is samengesteld rondom de deze populaire muzikant en entertainer Juliet.\n \nMet zijn nieuwste CD Let's Party brengt hij zijn 'Party Beat' sound ten gehore en zo is ook zijn nieuwste creatie Gezellig in de kring ontstaan. Dit nummer zal de aankomende periode in heel Nederland te zien en te horen zijn, maar ook op de zonnige \n(ei) landen zal iedereen met de voetjes en de heupen dansen op de tonen van deze 'Party Beat'.

How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.\n\nThe Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product Backlog management includes:\n\nClearly expressing Product Backlog items;\nOrdering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;\nEnsuring the value of the work the Development Team performs;\nEnsuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,\nEnsuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.\n\nThe Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the Product Owner remains accountable.\n\nThe Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a backlog item's priority must convince the Product Owner.\n\nFor the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The Product Owner's decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog.

The locals calls it monyet belanda (\"Dutch monkey\"), or evenorang belanda (\"Dutchman\"), as Indonesians remarked that the Dutch colonisers often had similarly large bellies and big noses.\nProboscis monkeys generally live in groups composed of one adult male, some adult females and their offspring. All-male groups may also exist. Some individuals are solitary, mostly males. Monkey groups live in overlapping home ranges, with little territoriality, in a fission-fusion society, with groups gathering at sleeping sites as night falls. There exist bands which arise when groups come together and slip apart. Groups gather during the day and travel together, but individuals only groom and play with those in their own group. One-male groups consist of 9--19 individuals, while bands can consist of as many as 60 individuals. One-male groups typically consist of three to 12 individuals, but can contain more. Serious aggression is uncommon among monkeys but minor aggression does commonly occur. Overall, members of the same bands are fairly tolerant of each other. A linear dominance hierarchy exists between females. Males of one-male groups can stay in their groups for six to eight years. Replacements in the resident males appear to occur without serious aggression. Upon reaching adulthood, males leave their natal groups and join all-male groups. Females also sometimes leave their natal groups, perhaps to avoid infanticide or inbreeding, reduce competition for food, or elevation their social status.\nProboscis monkeys are known to make various vocalizations. When communicating the status of group, males will emit honks. They have a special honk emitted towards infants, which is also used for reassurance. Males will also produce alarm calls to signal danger. Both sexes give threat calls, but each are different. In addition, females and immature individuals will emit so-called \"female calls\" when angry. Honks, roars and snarls are made during low-intensity agonistic encounters. Nonvocal displays include leaping-branch shaking, bare-teeth open mouth threats and erection in males, made in the same situations.\n\nFemales become sexually mature at five years old. They experience sexual swelling, which involves the genitals becoming pink or reddened. At one site, matings largely take place between February and November, while births occur between March and May. Copulations tend to last for half a minute. The male will grab the female by the ankles or torso and mount her from behind. Both sexes will encourage mating, but they are not always successful. When soliciting, both sexes will make pouted faces. In addition, males will sometimes vocalize and females will present their backsides. Mating pairs are sometimes harassed by sub-adults. Proboscis monkey may also engage in mounting with no reproductive purpose, such as playful and same-sex mounting. Gestation usually last 166--200 days or slightly more. Females tend to give birth at night or in the early morning. The mothers then eat the placenta and lick their infants clean. The young begin to eat solid foods at six weeks and are weaned at seven months old. The nose of a young male grows slowly until reaching adulthood.

It happens on the two times that the bass sings \"denn nun hab ich vor euch Ruh\" as explained below.\n\nMozart assigns a 7-note \"theme\" to the syllables \"denn nun hab ich vor euch Ruh\" (00:38). It is a simple theme, merely 5 notes descending in whole steps from A3 followed by 2 notes re-ascending, also in whole steps.\n\nAfter a brief pause, the theme is repeated (00:44), only the first note is an entire octave lower than before - at A2. As before, the theme descends 5 notes to D2. This famous note D2 is the lowest sung note in the classical repertoire, and is outside the normal range of basses. Reaching it is no easy feat. Perhaps showing uncharacteristic mercy, Mozart allows his theme to jump to a more comfortable A2 before having the bass sustain the long note. Despite having to reach D2, this was the easy part.\n\nThe theme pops up again at the end of the aria. This time, it follows a difficult coloratura section (2:07-2:26) in which the bass must sing an elaborate tune full of runs up and down on the musical scale. Right before beginning the \"denn nun...\" theme, the bass is required to go from E2 up to A3 and then back down to A2 in one step (2:16-2:26). That bit is tiresome, but Mozart affords the bass only the tiniest rest before beginning the \"denn nun\" theme.\n\nThe familiar 5-note cascade begins again (2:28) - this time on D3. Uh-oh. If on the first go-around, we descended an entire octave for the repeat, does this mean that this time, the repeat will begin at D2? That's what the rules tell us, but Mozart is making up the rules and he does something way more ingenius.\n\nThe repeat (2:35) begins not an octave lower, but at the same spot. Barring a couple of minor semi-tone changes, the repeat is exactly the same as the first run. This means that, according to the rules, this theme will end relatively easily for the bass. On the ascent in the second repeat, he'll jump up to a very comfortable D3 before having to sustain the long note.\n\nBut no! Instead, Mozart makes him go DOWN - down FOUR steps to D2. The bass is now faced with the sickening challenge of holding a D2 note for 8 bars. What could have possessed Mozart to write that sustained D2? Trying to set a record? Well, he succeeded. But no. Mozart was likely doing what he always tried to - imbue his characters with emotion and life through his music. Remember, this entire aria is about his joy at being able to decapitate his two prisoners. That D2 represents the unbridled and giddy evil that permeates Osmin's character. The D2 is a brilliant choice by Mozart and a surprising one. But in retrospect, it fits perfectly with the evil Osmin we know and love.\n\nI've heard many basses try to perform this D2 note. Only one I've heard has done it convincingly. He's not the one in this video.", "title": "Entfuhrung aus dem Serail - Wie will ich triumphieren", "publishedDate": "2007-09-25T18:47:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "3f0m0IfEvLM", "description": "they are the cutest cupel ever.", "title": "IMG_1537.MOV", "publishedDate": "2012-03-19T04:20:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "3f1d8PxUJJ8", "description": "Learn how to say roarer correctly with our pronounciation tutorials", "title": "How to pronounce roarer", "publishedDate": "2014-07-03T02:37:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "3f24xSBwsF8", "description": "Subscribe and join 3LAMESTUDIO: http://goo.gl/BmPwht\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/lamestudio\nnow,i was playing angry birds,when all of a sudden park jai-sang,aka psy invades the screen(dancing oppa gangnam style),and obviously he takes down the all things,i mean that kind of structure where the pigs are.\ni was about to play..and i don't know.\nanyway it's just a parody.\nThis video is fair use under U.S. copyright law because it is noncommercial and transformative in nature, uses no more of the original than necessary, and has no negative effect on the market for the original work\nhave fun and if u like it just subscribe and thumbs up!\nMore Psy & Gangnam Style: http://goo.gl/rzkEH", "title": "Angry Birds Gangnam Style funny Parody Video", "publishedDate": "2012-11-06T17:39:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "3f27sEz0Rek", "description": "Indulge yourselves in the sexiest battle ever!

Filter - The Ultimate Guide:  http://youtu.be/j3CleipKc5A\n\nNOTES:\nThis is the Hayward Selecta Flow Multiport Valve. It tends to fail over time. You will notice water leaking from the top or the valve will be impossible to turn. \n\nThis is due to the O-ring in the handle getting pinched or damaged by the spring that sits below it. The O-ring in the handle is pretty much impossible to change due to the nature of the design of the valve. The best and only thing to do is replace the valve. \n\nRemember to order the exact model number of the valve you are replacing. It is a simple repair. Pop one out and insert the other (just remember how the old one was sitting so you can re-insert the new one correctly).\n\nThe best way to make these valve last a long time is to use them sparingly. That means limit the backwashing between filter cleanings (basically don't use the valve). I only use them twice a year when I do the filters. That seems to give them the longest lifespan. Of course if you need to backwash your filter go ahead and do it.\n\nMrdgvb1 Social Media Links:\nWEBSITE: http://www.swimmingpoollearning.com/\nGoogle +:  https://plus.google.com/b/107735343574734346096/\nBlogger:  http://poolmandave.blogspot.com/ \nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Youtube-Mrdgvb1/381257741926763?ref=hl", "title": "Hayward Mutliport backwash valve troubleshooting", "publishedDate": "2012-04-15T05:38:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "3f6x2anmPkI", "description": "Ganhe dinheiro investindo em commodities , saiba mais em: http://www.g8investimentos.com/", "title": "O que s\u00e3o Commodities ?", "publishedDate": "2011-03-17T03:20:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "3f72CTDe4-0", "description": "http://www.amazon.com/Tom-Lehrer-Collection-CD-DVD/dp/B0039TD73G/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1284930177&sr=8-3\n\nUse the above link and get the uninterrupted Lehrer TV-performance and The Tom Lehrer Collection from Amazon.com.\n\nhttp://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=5257149\n\nIf you live in the United States you can also buy the collection from Shout!

Among the things they did, in an attempt to make the church more commercial, was to introduce the vernacular into portions of the mass to replace Latin, and to widen somewhat the range of music permissible in the liturgy. But I feel that if they really want to sell the product in this secular age, what they ought to do is to re-do some of the liturgical music in popular song forms. I have a modest example here.

In the second half, a surreal interplay involving a carrot unfolds at a railway station.\n\nWhat does it all mean? Very little, one suspects. Instead, enjoy the pleasingly peculiar lines (the curious rhythms and phrasing are similar to the choice wordplay in 1980's 'Sir Henry At Rawlinson End'), the arresting visuals and, above all, a rare acting role for Quentin Crisp as the stationmaster.

Napole\u00f3n, interesado en contar con la flota espa\u00f1ola para poder desembarcar un ej\u00e9rcito de 160.000 hombres en territorio ingl\u00e9s, promete a Godoy que le entregar\u00e1 un reino en una de las provincias portuguesas. \nAceptada la alianza entre franceses y espa\u00f1oles, el 20 de agosto de 1805 se hallan concentradas en C\u00e1diz las flotas de ambos pa\u00edses, dirigidas por Villeneuve. En respuesta, el almirante brit\u00e1nico Nelson ordena que C\u00e1diz sea bloqueada por mar. \nEl 17 de octubre, Villeneuve recibe informaci\u00f3n del servicio de inteligencia: 4 buques brit\u00e1nicos salen al Mediterr\u00e1neo desde Gibraltar escoltando un convoy, y otros 2 buques se hallaban en Gibraltar reaprovision\u00e1ndose y sometidos a reparaciones. Pensando que la flota de Nelson se ha debilitado, se decide a sacar la escuadra de C\u00e1diz. \nEl encuentro entre ambas flotas se produce el d\u00eda 21. Los ingleses se han dividido en dos columnas, mientras Villeneuve ordena virar en redondo a toda la l\u00ednea, contra los consejos de los espa\u00f1oles. En consecuencia, la l\u00ednea se rompe, dejando grandes claros al enemigo. \nA media ma\u00f1ana comienzan los combates. Las andanadas se suceden, con clara ventaja para los barcos ingleses, que maniobran para conseguir buenas posiciones de tiro. La descoordinaci\u00f3n entre los aliados espa\u00f1oles y franceses es manifiesta, obligados a defenderse de manera desesperada. Las bajas se suceden por doquier. \nLa mayor parte de los nav\u00edos aliados fueron incendiados, hundidos o capturados. Churruca, Alcal\u00e1 Galiano y Gravina, la elite de la oficialidad de la Marina de Guerra espa\u00f1ola, murieron en combate, as\u00ed como el ingl\u00e9s Nelson. Villeneuve fue hecho prisionero. \nLos espa\u00f1oles perdieron 1.022 muertos y 1.383 heridos. Las p\u00e9rdidas brit\u00e1nicas fueron 1609 muertos \u00f3 heridos, y las franceses de m\u00e1s de 3000 hombres y m\u00e1s de 1000 heridos. El n\u00famero total de capturados, entre franceses y espa\u00f1oles, sumaba unos 8.000. La victoria sobre el combinado franco-espa\u00f1ol permiti\u00f3 a Inglaterra tener la supremac\u00eda naval en los siguientes 100 a\u00f1os. --\nSuscr\u00edbete a nuestro canal : \n\u25b6 http://bit.ly/10rPVgk\n\nS\u00edguenos en: \n\u25b6 https://www.facebook.com/artehistoria\n\u25b6 http://pinterest.com/artehistoria/\n\u25b6 https://twitter.com/ArteHistoriaCom\n\u25b6 http://www.youtube.com/artehistoriacom/\n\nArteHistoria : la web del Arte y la Cultura en espa\u00f1ol.\n\nArtehistoria es una iniciativa privada dedicada a la creaci\u00f3n de contenidos culturales mediante la utilizaci\u00f3n de t\u00e9cnicas inform\u00e1ticas de \u00faltima generaci\u00f3n en las que se combinan las recreaciones y animaciones tridimensionales de ciudades, edificios y escenas de vida cotidiana a muy alta poligonizaci\u00f3n, con la creaci\u00f3n de mapas evolutivos, estudios compositivos, digitalizaci\u00f3n de documentos, etc. Todo ello acompa\u00f1ado siempre de una informaci\u00f3n documental avalada por los profesores m\u00e1s destacados de la Universidad espa\u00f1ola.

It\u2019s really an extraordinary thing and it\u2019s done by the European Space Agency. The mission has lasted ten years I think because the distances in space are just enormous. There\u2019s a lot of space in space. And for those of you who have not done this please visit planetary.org and look at the photographs, the pictures coming back from this thing. You can see what people have speculated a lot about the nature of cometary bodies \u2013 comets and asteroids is they\u2019re not a single rock. It\u2019s a gravel, rubble pile as we like to say. These rocks are held together by their tiny but nevertheless non-zero amount of gravity.\n\nJust rendezvousing with this comet is an extraordinary thing. Compared to the vastness of space it\u2019s a very, very small object. Yet it is part of the primordial solar system. There\u2019s going to be something there that no one\u2019s ever thought of. We\u2019re going to make discoveries that no one has imagined yet. And we\u2019re going to have this adventure. This is the thing about exploration. When you explore you\u2019re going to have two things. You\u2019re going to make discoveries. There\u2019ll be stuff out there that no one\u2019s thought of \u2013 something about ice, something about rocks, something about gravity, something about orbital motion, something about iridium \u2013 I\u2019m making that up. Something about elements that we don\u2019t think about too much. And you\u2019re going to have an adventure. There\u2019s going to be an adventure. Landing this spacecraft, watching the object come closer and closer. That\u2019s going to be exciting. And as we say all the time, what are you guys going to find out there? We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to find and that\u2019s why we\u2019re looking. And as I like to always do I tie it back to the only preventable natural disaster which is the earth getting hit with an asteroid.\n\nFor me practically you can see that if you were to set off an explosive here to try to deflect this thing. If it were going to hit the earth \u2013 this was not going to hit the earth everybody. But if there were another one that were going to hit the earth you can see that if you just tried to push it you probably wouldn\u2019t influence it properly. You\u2019d just make it scatter and you might make things worse. So that\u2019s why we at the Planetary Society advocate our laser bees program where we zap the surface of one of these with lasers. But that aside, I hope to be among the people that does not go the way of the ancient dinosaurs. There is no evidence at all that the ancient dinosaurs had a space program and it cost them.\n\nDirected / Produced by Jonathan Fowler, Elizabeth Rodd, and Dillon Fitton", "title": "Bill Nye on Rosetta comet landing: We'll make discoveries that nobody's imagined yet.", "publishedDate": "2014-11-12T16:08:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "3fhkhcdph28", "description": "*No Copyright Infringement Intended*\n\nDecided to cover this wonderful piece of music genius, with a close friend and advisee!

Ambitious, expansive but brilliantly cohesive, \"Stick By This\" joins the dots between Booka Shade's melodic electronica (\"Falling\"), Leftfield's dub techno (\"I'm Running\"), the classic musicality of MJ Cole (\"Lost In You\") and warm Laurent Garnier-esque techno (\"Need You Back\").\n\nAdding further colour to the album's spectrum, the album's first single - \"Lost In You\" - is a deep, bass-driven piano house anthem that features the soulful vocals of Janai and has gained props from US house godfather Tony Humphries and UK bass talent Toddla T -- the latter supporting the track BBC Radio 1.\n\nFinding fans at opposite ends of the dance music spectrum is nothing new for the Dusky duo. Previously existing as progressive/ melodic house entity Solarity, Dusky are London based musicians Alfie Granger-Howell and Nick Harriman. As comfortable writing elegant orchestral pieces or stirring piano motifs as they are jackin' garage house and epic techno grooves, their diverse sounds are united by the duo's singular aim -- to compose electronic music with depth, soul and originality.\n\nInfluenced by everything from classical and jazz to techno, UK bass and avant-garde electronica, their compositions have been supported by DJs as diverse as Dubfire, Sasha, Vincenzo, Shur-I-Khan, Motorcitysoul and Above & Beyond.\n\nOne of 2011's most exciting debut albums, \"Stick By This\" looks set to extend their appeal further yet.\n\nFollow Anjunadeep:\nWebsite: http://www.anjunadeep.com/\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/anjunadeep\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/Anjunadeep\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/anjunadeep\nGoogle+: http://bit.ly/deep-google\nSoundCloud: http://soundcloud.com/anjunadeep", "title": "Dusky feat.
