CE, a thousand years after the DSS. For centuries, this text has been the foundation for Jewish and Christian translators.\n\nThe major difference between the Aleppo Codex and the Dead Sea Scrolls is the addition of the vowel pointings to the Hebrew words. These pointings provide the vowel sounds that are not present in the Hebrew language and were probably inserted into the text to standardize pronunciation.\n\nIn the DSS the name Israel is written with five Hebrew letters. The first letter is the letter yud representing the \"y\" sound. Then resh for the r, sin for the s, aleph which is silent and the lamed for the l. In the Aleppo codex, vowel pointings, in the form of dots and dashes are placed above and below each letter to represent the vowel sounds, providing the pronunciation yisra'el.\n\nWhile the Masoretic text and the Dead Sea Scrolls were transcribed a thousand years apart, they are amazingly similar proving that the copying methods employed by the Jewish scribes over the centuries  are very sophisticated and successful. However, there are some differences, some are simple variations of a reading, while others are much more complex.\n\nPsalm 145 is an acrostic psalm where each verse begins with the next letter of the Hebrew alphabet. In the Aleppo Codex the first verse begins with the letter aleph, the second with the beyt, the third with the gimel, and so on. Verse 13 begins with the letter mem, the 13th letter of the Hebrew alphabet, the next verse begins with the letter samech, the 15th letter of the Hebrew alphabet. There is no verse beginning with the 14th letter nun.\n\nWhen we examine Psalm 145 from the Dead Sea Scrolls we find between the verse beginning with the mem and the verse beginning with the samech, the verse beginning with the letter nun.  There we read: \u05e0\u05d0\u05de\u05df \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d1\u05db\u05d5\u05dc \u05de\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05d5 , which translates as \"God is faithful in his words, and gracious in all his deeds.\"\n\nThis is why Psalm 145:13 reads differently in the KJV and the modern versions such as the RSV. The KJV was written prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls while the RSV and other modern versions were written afterward and often incorporate what has been found in the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n___________________\n\nNarration: Jeff A.

He composed in a style commonly known as the ars subtilior.\n\nFuions de ci (ballade in manneristic style)\nRogers Covey-Crump, Mark Padmore and Paul Hillier\n\nIt has been suggested that Jacob Senleches has been born in St. Luc near Evreux, France (U. G\u00fcnther) or in Senleches (or Sanlesches) in Cambrai, today France (A. Tomasello). In 1382 Senleches seems to have been present at the court of Eleanor of Castile (d. September 1382), possibly in her service. In Fuions de ci he laments Eleanor's death and resolves to seek his fortune either \"en Aragon, en France ou en Bretaingne\".\n\nAfterwards he is found in service of Pedro de Luna, Cardinal of Aragon (later Antipope Benedict XIII, 1394-1423), as a harpist. There is a treasury document assigning payments to one \"Jaquemin de Sanleches, juglar de harpe\" from the royal household in Navarra dated August 21, 1383. The payment is made so that Jacquemin may return to \"his master\", Pedro de Luna.\n\nA supplication to Benedict XIII in 1395 records Jacob de Selesses asking for the benefice attached to a parish church in the diocese of Cambrai.\n\nDespite the small number of transmitted compositions Jacob de Senleches is counted among the central personalities of Ars subtilior. He developed many rhythmic and notational innovations.\n\nThe texts deal mainly with himself and his career. \n\nArs subtilior (more subtle art) is a musical style characterized by rhythmic and notational complexity, centered around Paris, Avignon in southern France, also in northern Spain at the end of the fourteenth century. The style also is found in the French Cypriot repertory. Often the term is used in contrast with ars nova, which applies to the musical style of the preceding period from about 1310 to about 1370; though some scholars prefer to consider the ars subtilior a subcategory of the earlier style. Primary sources for the ars subtilior are the Chantilly Codex and the Modena Codex.\n\nAs often seen at the end of any musical era, the end of the medieval era is marked by a highly manneristic style known as Ars subtilior. In some ways, this was an attempt to meld the French and Italian styles. This music was highly stylized, with a rhythmic complexity that was not matched until the 20th century. In fact, not only was the rhythmic complexity of this repertoire largely unmatched for five and a half centuries, with extreme syncopations, mensural trickery, and even examples of augenmusik (such as a chanson by Baude Cordier written out in manuscript in the shape of a heart), but also its melodic material was quite complex as well, particularly in its interaction with the rhythmic structures. Already discussed under Ars Nova has been the practice of isorhythm, which continued to develop through late-century and in fact did not achieve its highest degree of sophistication until early in the 15th century. Instead of using isorhythmic techniques in one or two voices, or trading them among voices, some works came to feature a pervading isorhythmic texture which rivals the integral serialism of the 20th century in its systematic ordering of rhythmic and tonal elements. The term \"mannerism\" was applied by later scholars, as it often is, in response to an impression of sophistication being practised for its own sake, a malady which some authors have felt infected the Ars subtilior.", "title": "Jacob Senleches - Fuions de ci (22/25) (ballade in manneristic style)", "publishedDate": "2010-01-30T02:49:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "4-j7B_5IP7w", "description": "See more http://www.dorkly.com\n\nHis first priority is killing a plumber.

Iranian nation is one of the Oldest Continuous Civilizations in the World. Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic populations occupied caves in the Zagros and Elburz mountains. The earliest civilizations in the region descended from the Zagros foothills, where they developed agriculture and animal husbandry, and established the first urban cultures in the Tigris-Euphrates basin in present day Iraq. The earliest urban peoples in what is today Iranian territory were the Elamites in the extreme southwest region of Khuzestan. The arrival of the Aryan peoples\u2014Medes and Persians\u2014 on the Iranian plateau in the first millennium B.C.E. marked the beginning of the Iranian civilization, rising to the heights of the great Achaemenid Empire consolidated by Cyrus the Great in 550 B.C.E. Under the rulers Darius the Great and Xerxes, the Achaemenid rulers extended their empire from northern India to Egypt.\nDown to the present, one pattern has repeated again and again in Iranian civilization: the conquerors of Iranian territory are eventually themselves conquered by Iranian culture. In a word, they become Persianized.\n\nArt\nIran has one of the richest art heritages in world history and encompasses many disciplines including architecture, painting, weaving, pottery, calligraphy, metalworking and stonemasonry. There is also a very vibrant Iranian modern and contemporary art scene.\nIranian art has gone through numerous phases of evolution. The unique aesthetics of Iran is evident from the Achaemenid reliefs in Persepolis to the mosaic paintings of Bishapur. \n\nThere are several languages spoken in different parts of Iran. The predominant language and national language is Farsi  Persian, which is spoken across the country\n\nReligion in Iran \nZoroastrianism was the national faith of Iran for more than a millennium before the Arab conquest. It has had an immense influence on Iranian philosophy, culture and art after the people of Iran converted to Islam\nFollowers of the Baha'i faith comprise the largest non-Muslim minority in Iran.  Most of the Baha'i are of Persian descent, although there seem to be many among the Azerbaijani and Kurdish people. The Baha'i are severely persecuted\nPersian Rugs\n\nIn Iran, Persian Rugs have always been a vital part of the Persian culture\n\nThe Persian Garden was designed as a reflection of paradise on earth; the word \"garden\" itself coming from Persian roots. The special place of the garden in the Iranian heart can be seen in their architecture, in the ruins of Iran, and in their paintings\nCuisine:\nCuisine in Iran is considered to be one of the most ancient forms of cuisine around the world. Bread is arguably the most important food in Iran, with a large variety of different bread, some of the most popular of which include: nan and hamir, which are baked in large clay ovens (also called \"tenurs\"). In Iranian cuisine, there are many dishes that are made from dairy products. \n\nNowr\u016bz ( \u0646\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0632, IPA: [nou\u02c8\u027eu\u02d0z], \"New Day\", originally \"New Light\") is the name of the New Year in Iranian calendars and the corresponding traditional celebrations. Nowruz is also widely referred to as the Persian New Year. \n\nThe Haft S\u012bn items are: * sabzeh - wheat, barley or lentil sprouts growing in a dish - symbolizing rebirth * samanu - a sweet pudding made from wheat germ - symbolizing affluence * senjed - the dried fruit of the oleaster tree - symbolizing love * s\u012br - garlic - symbolizing medicine * s\u012bb - apples - symbolizing beauty and health * somaq - sumac berries - symbolizing (the color of) sunrise * serkeh - vinegar - symbolizing age and patience.\n\n\n\nRabbits Born in Custody of San Diego County Department of Animal Services (SPCA Pet Killers & Animal Abusers) starved to death, and California spent over $100,000 to cover up their officer's crime, In Charge Lieutenant Lt.

The gameplay action was always through an in-car perspective.\n\nPlayers could choose to run single races at each track, or run for the season championship. The race distance was chosen by the player, which ranged from 10 miles to the realistic distance of 500 miles for the superspeedway races. In the MS-DOS version, the championship consisted of a visit to each of the eight tracks. In the NES and Game Boy versions, the season championship consisted of each of the four tracks run twice, for a total of eight races. Championship points were awarded consistent to the real-life Winston Cup of the time.\n\nBoth the MS-DOS and Nintendo versions allowed the player to set up the car, with effects to be seen. Both of those versions also allowed the player to choose whether they would race with the effect of damage on their car or not. However, a large enough collision with another racecar on the track always would result in the player going out of the race in an out-of-control crash.\n\n MS-DOS versionThe MS-DOS version, released in 1990, featured eight tracks, which was more than the NES' four. The tracks were Daytona, Talladega, Atlanta, Bristol, Sears Point, Watkins Glen, Darlington and Michigan.\n\nLike the NES version, Bill Elliott won most of the simulated races. The \"field\" of 11 cars included nine fictional drivers:[1]\n\nBill Elliott - Ford, brown #9\n\"Ted Alpen\" - Ford, blue #25\n\"Barney Barnsdale\" - Pontiac, peach #1\n\"Fred Forman\" - Oldsmobile, white #3\n\"Tranie Blue\" - Oldsmobile, red #10\n\"Kent Steer\" - Chevrolet, purple #8\n\"Iggy Nition\" - Chevrolet, yellow #7\n\"Goggles Pizzano\" - Buick, light blue #5\n\"Rexx Karrs\" - Pontiac, green #21\n\"Axel Folly\" - Mercury, lime green #22\nPlayer's car.\nExcept for Mercury, all of the makes represented were in Winston Cup racing at the start of the 1991 season. Buick bowed out in 1991, Oldsmobile in 1994 and Pontiac in 2003.[2]\n\nThe AI of the drivers was largely spread out by speed, but did not have specific differences in driving style (all had the same aggressiveness, same driving lines, etc.) However, \"Ted Alpen\" often was among the top 5 drivers for races, as was, to a lesser extent, \"Fred Forman\". \"Kent Steer\" and \"Iggy Nition\" often were in the middle of the pack.\n\nThe MS-DOS version of the game also offered replay functions, but no ability to save a replay.\n\n NES and Game Boy versionsThe NES version featured four tracks: Daytona, Talladega, Watkins Glen, and Sears Point, the latter two being road courses.\n\nIn the NES and Game Boy versions, players competed against fifteen computer opponents,[3] including Bill Elliott, who normally won races that the player did not. In rare cases, one of the other fourteen fictional computer opponents won races.\n\nThe \"field of sixteen\" included:\n\nThe player-controlled car, and\nBill Elliott\nAmory Jackson\nBo Johanson\nBuddy Kiss, Jr.\nCole Mattrick\n Cooter Davis\nCurtis Colwell\nDanny Yates\nDoc Jones\nJason Williams\n Jim Bob Lee\nLamar Stevens\nMick Jacobs\nRay Parson\nT-Bone Henry\n \n\nPlayers could choose to run a single race, or the season championship. The season championship comprised eight races, consisting of each of the four tracks run twice. The distances for the races was selected by the player, and ranged from 10 miles to 500 miles. Players received points towards the championship based on the points structure of the actual NASCAR Winston Cup series. Another separate game score was tallied inside the game, awarding higher points for longer race distances chosen. A bug possibly appeared in the game, as frequently when the full distance was chosen for the season championship, some races were run with extended distances.\n\nPlayers could choose to drive three different cars, a Chevrolet Lumina (#5 Mobil 1), a Ford Thunderbird (#11 Ford), or a Pontiac Grand Prix (#25 Melling Racing). In real life, the #5 car was sponsored by Levi Garrett. The sponsorships Budweiser (#11) and Kodiak (#25) are unbranded in this game. Also the #25 was actually a Chevrolet in real life. The game also featured custom set-ups, although considerably less complicated than other games of the time. Car colors were used to distinguish one make from the other: All Fords were red (with a #9 decal on the back denoting Elliott's car, the only one in this game to use such a decal), all Chevrolets were black, and all Pontiacs were green and white.\n\nThe Game Boy version was very similar to the NES version, except that Atlanta replaced Talladega. Additionally, Pontiac was excluded and players chose between a Ford, Chevrolet or Oldsmobile.\n\n Amiga versionVisually, the Amiga version was much closer to the MS-DOS version than the Nintendo ports.\n\n This section requires expansion.

Others translate it at \"Snot-nosed\".\n\nHanatarash are infamous for their extremely dangerous live shows consisting entirely of on-stage destruction and utter disregard for anyone's safety. The most notorious incident involved Yamatsuka throwing junk around with a backhoe inside a venue. On another occasion, he inflicted a deep wound on his leg with an electrical saw, but carried on with the show. A dead cat is also known to have been cut in half during a show. The band once caused so much damage to a live house in Kyoto that it was forced to close.\n\nAt a 1985 gig in Tokyo's Superloft, Hanatarash had the audience fill out forms relieving the band of responsibility for any possible bodily harm caused by the performance. The show stopped just as Yamatsuka was about to throw a lit molotov cocktail onto the stage, which was gasoline-drenched from a barrel. The performance cost the venue \u00a5600,000 ($6000) in repair costs.\n\nSoon unable to be allowed to play anywhere, Yamatsuka went on to form Ultra Freak Out Or Die and Boredoms, among countless other projects. The 1990s saw Hanatarash resurface with some releases and performances, sans on-stage mayhem.\n\n\"4: AIDS-a-Delic\" is one of thier releases and the reason why I say that is because this album was either released in 1996 or 1994. I have used the alternative cover of this album because the original one has female nipples on it and youtube fears those.

To be completely honest, it really is not as much of a \"haunting\" of a spirit as it is a recording of specific energy. Many professionals in the paranormal describe this type of supernatural experience as a \"recording of past energy\". It is believed, that in a location where a person released a large amount of energy, or heightened emotions were experienced, and the energy imbeds itself. As a result of the lingering energy, individuals in the future may get to experience seeing a type of \"recording\" of these events. The following describes some of the signs that a haunting is residual:\n\n1. One of the first things that the witness to a residual haunting will notice is that the spirit does not seem to interact, or acknowledge that there is anyone present. The spirit will almost seem oblivious to anything that is occurring in its presence.\n\n2. There have been cases in which the apparition will seem to come and go. However, even when the actual spirit is not present, it is common for noises to be heard by the living. These noises often sound as if the spirit is walking, or moving things around. Once again, this is simply the energy exhibiting itself.\n\n3. The energy that is felt in a residual haunting may be quite tremendous for the individual experiencing it, but it is not something that has to be feared. The energy may also result in interruptions to electricity and electrical appliances. It is also quite possible for parts of the area to change. Examples include the opening and shutting of doors. Once again, this is merely energy. There is no conscious effort on behalf of the spirit when it comes to these activities.\n\nLEASE SUBSCRIBE & JOIN THE D.G.I FAMILY. \n\nPlease follow us on twitter at https://twitter.com/DorsetghostDGI\n& like our facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Dorset-Ghost-Investigators/259833150723729\n\nOur website is Dorsetghostinvestigators.TV\n\nWe are two Ghost hunters that have completed 84 ghost hunts at the Most haunted locations around England.\nWe have had some good and bad experiences over the last 3 years, we've experiences real possessions, we've come across what people believe to be demons or jinns or even the devil.\nWe've had many paranormal experiences over the years that we can prove and cannot be explained.\n\nWe've experienced Paranormal Activity inside many haunted buildings around the UK which we believe are Spirits of the dead, which some call Ghosts.\nWe tried out a lot of different equipment like Thermal imaging cameras, Night vision camcorders, Ovilus 3, PSB7 Spirit box, Franks Ghost box, RT-EVP Recorder, Sony DS40 Dictaphones, Dowsing rods, Geo Pod, Parascope, K2 Emf Meter, HVL-IRM Infrared lights, Ouija Board, Pendulums, Trigger Objects, Motion Sensors.\n\nWe are the real deal and always will be!\n\nThank You for watching\nDorset Ghost Investigators\nGlen and Ahmed.\n\nMusic credit to:\nKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\".\nLicensed under Creative Commons \n\"Attribution 3.0\" \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nThis ghost investigation took place at icen way in Dorchester.

The peanut was probably first domesticated and cultivated in the valleys of Paraguay. It is an annual herbaceous plant growing 30 to 50 cm (1.0 to 1.6 ft) tall. The leaves are opposite, pinnate with four leaflets (two opposite pairs; no terminal leaflet), each leaflet 1 to 7 cm (\u215c to 2\u00be in) long and 1 to 3 cm (\u215c to 1 inch) broad.\n\nThe flowers are a typical peaflower in shape, 2 to 4 cm (0.8 to 1.6 in) (\u00be to 1\u00bd in) across, yellow with reddish veining. Hypogaea means \"under the earth\"; after pollination, the flower stalk elongates causing it to bend until the ovary touches the ground. Continued stalk growth then pushes the ovary underground where the mature fruit develops into a legume pod, the peanut -- a classical example of geocarpy. Pods are 3 to 7 cm (1.2 to 2.8 in) long, containing 1 to 4 seeds.\n\nPeanuts are known by many other local names such as earthnuts, ground nuts, goober peas, monkey nuts, pygmy nuts and pig nuts.Despite its name and appearance, the peanut is not a nut, but rather a legume.\n\nThe domesticated peanut is an amphidiploid or allotetraploid, meaning that it has two sets of chromosomes from two different species, thought to be A. duranensis and A. ipaensis. These likely combined in the wild to form the tetraploid species A. monticola, which gave rise to the domesticated peanut. This domestication might have taken place in Paraguay or Bolivia, where the wildest strains grow today. Many pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Moche, depicted peanuts in their art.\n\nArcheologists have dated the oldest specimens to about 7,600 years, found in Peru.Cultivation spread as far as Mesoamerica, where the Spanish conquistadors found the tlalcacahuatl (Nahuatl = \"peanut\", whence Mexican Spanish, cacahuate and French, cacahu\u00e8te) being offered for sale in the marketplace of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City). The plant was later spread worldwide by European traders.\n\nAlthough the peanut was mainly a garden crop for much of the colonial period of North America, it was mostly used as animal feed stock until the 1930s.In the United States, a US Department of Agriculture program (see below) to encourage agricultural production and human consumption of peanuts was instituted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. George Washington Carver is well known for his participation in that program in which he developed hundreds of recipes for peanuts.\n\nCopyrights : MrZygy3", "title": "Peanuts", "publishedDate": "2012-12-21T10:12:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "408aVTebLs4", "description": "Show em Curitiba, dia 20/10/2013", "title": "Caf\u00e9 a dois - Ana Larousse e Phill Veras", "publishedDate": "2013-10-21T21:00:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "408zipXvtAg", "description": "Clip RDL - Extrait de l'album \"Brulux On The Flux\"\n\nCommander \"BRULUX ON THE FLUX\" :\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/fr/album/brulux-on-the-flux/id656252656\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Zoogatabrule\nhttps://twitter.com/bruluxx", "title": "Clip RDL - Brulux On The Flux", "publishedDate": "2013-07-04T19:34:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "409IDttJFvo", "description": "The information in this video is provided as general and factual information and should not be regarded as personal advice.

The case in Florida where 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman has put the national spotlight on that question, while it draws a lot of media attention. Zimmerman claims self defense. Each state has its own version of a self defense law, including Texas. Texas has had use of deadly force law for quite some time. But it wasn't until September 1, 2007 that a revision was made. It's called the Castle Doctrine.It states that a person does not need to retreat before using deadly force, firing a gun or using another weapon. You don't have to be a victim. If you're a witness to someone else committing a crime, the law allows the use of deadly force. Attorney David Barlow says there are many other factors that have to be considered in order to use deadly force. \"You can't use force that is greater than necessary. Words alone are not sufficient. You can call me every name in the book and I can't use force against you. You can't walk up to me and slap me and then I shoot you. If you have a concealed handgun license an carry a gun with you, it doesn't mean you can use it anytime and everywhere you want to.\"Barlow says under the law, a judge or jury must look at whether a reasonable person would have acted in the same way under those circumstances. Florida also has a Castle Doctrine. Barlow believes it doesn't really apply to the Trayvon Martin case. \"I don't see the Castle Doctrine making that much of a difference in the case. I think the same thing would have happened whether they had the law or not. Actions would have been the same.\"Castle Doctrine link: http://www.rc123.com/texas_castle_doctrine.htmlLindsey KovacevichReporter409-895-4662Lkovacevich@kfdm.com", "title": "4-13-2012 Texas Castle Doctrine", "publishedDate": "2012-06-11T17:18:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "40JLM0VVNWI", "description": "Behold the mighty Abhorrence!!\nAbhorrence was formed in Helsinki,Finland 1989.

Hemoglobin has 4 subunits and binds oxygen in a cooperative manner. The cooperative binding mechanism of hemoglobin means that as each subunit binds a molecule of oxygen the other subunits increase their affinity for oxygen and more readily bind oxygen.  \n\u2022 This graph is shown is an oxygen dissociation curve and shows the amount of hemoglobin oxygen saturation at different pressures. This shows that when the pressure of oxygen is high hemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen and binds it readily while when oxygen pressure is low hemoglobin has a low affinity for oxygen and does not bind it very well. These properties allow hemoglobin to deliever oxygen to the body by readily binding oxygen in the lungs where oxygen pressure is high and then releasing oxygen at our tissues where oxygen pressure is low. \n\u2022 The three main factors that affect hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen are temperature, pH and the molecule DPG. \no And increase in temperature, 2-3DPG and pH shift the curve to the right and reduce hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen while decreasing temperature 2-3 DPG Ph shift the curve to the left and increase hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. \n\u2022 http://gassama.myweb.uga.edu/ picture", "title": "How does hemoglobin transport oxygen", "publishedDate": "2014-02-02T23:21:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "40fsPUawtMw", "description": "http://www.TransAlchemy.com Welcome to the scientific revolution that will change everything. are you ready for the paradigm shift? \n\nWelcome to the scientific revolution that will change everything. are you ready for the paradigm shift?\n\nVisit my website\nhttp://www.TransAlchemy.com\n\nis power\nSeek Truth\n\nVisit my blog\nhttp://key-universe.blogspot.com/\n\nshattersphere gravity lyrics\n\nHere come my final ticks of time\nFeel need to sweat but not to cry\nReflect upon my recent years\nI have no regrets and I have no fears\n\nI've always been a pretender\nSo how will I be remebered?\nAs I watch my life pass me by\nI hold on to strands of time\nNo need for my insecurity\nthe universe is one with me\n\nSoon we'll find a way\nPast this blackened day\nIf what I hear is true\nThen take me with you too\n\nNow my eyes grow old and weak\nGetting ready for eternal sleep\nHere it is just seconds away\nWho would have thought I'd die today\n\nI have no fears\nI have no lies\nReady to kiss my life goodbye\n\nI've never been a pretender\nThis is how I'll be remembered\n\n\nWikipedia (core concepts)\n  Hermes trismegistus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus\n  Hermeticism:              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism\n  Hermetism:                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetism\n  Hermit:                      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit\n  Hermetica                 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetica\n  Thoth:                       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth\n  Hermes                     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes\n  Mercury (mythology)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(mythology)\n  Hermetic Qabalah      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Qabalah\n  Emerald Tablet          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Tablet\n  Book of Thoth            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Thoth\n  Archimedes Palimpsest     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest\n  Theurgy          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theurgy\n  Rosicrucianism          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism\n Magi                          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magi\n  Magician  (paranormal)    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magician_%28paranormal%29\n Magician (fantasy)       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_%28fantasy%29\n  Kabbalah                   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah\n Metatron                     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron\n Sacred geometry         http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_geometry\n Tree of life                   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life  \n           Pythagorean theorem    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem\n Yahweh                      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yhvh\n Tetragrammaton          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton", "title": "Summoning the {Source} of the {Magi}", "publishedDate": "2008-05-21T19:45:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "40gECrmuCaU", "description": "This video depicts field testing of the DARPA Legged Squad Support System (LS3).

The group started working in the middle of the nineties of the twentieth century. Dvorcanec Aleksandar-Sale (vocal and harmonica) and Branko Neskoski-Bane (guitar) formed it and they still move the group's compact nucleus not allowing lost of the magic of the initial enthusiasm.\n\nDespite the fact that the group was formed in the nineties, when the rock stories are already past, the story of CrossRoad Blues Band is not very different from the ones in the sixties and seventies. A contribution for this kind of situation is the fact that the group works in Prilep (town in the southwest part of Macedonia) where despite the general process of globalization, all things go very slowly.\n\nSale gets in touch with Bane; they both from the local musicians choose the group's members and start their work in an old house out of town. Soon after that, they become a local attraction, mostly because of the big number of musicians on the scene (nine) and the unexpected sound they produce. They have numerous concerts in Prilep and the neighbourhood towns.\n\nIn the beginning of 2000, the group records its first single \"Kade e krajot?\" (\"Where's the end?\")- Remake of Buddy Guy or Tom Hyatt's music (not precisely fortified) according Sale's text. Dragan B. Kostic (the most famous radio disk jockey in the national radio) noticed this single, which with his comments and available space in the air in a great deal helped the group to gain its broader popularity. Thanks to him, CrossRoad Blues Band manages to get terms in the studios of the Macedonian Television to record its first album named as \"Tutun Bluz\" (Tobacco Blues).\n\nThe motives treated in the CrossRoad Blues Band's songs are from the social sphere and the problems of the ordinary man, which are a common theme in the blues. Curiosity presents the Macedonian text in the songs. Immediately after the recording of the album, CrossRoad Blues Band got offer to participate to the prestigious Blues&Soul Festival in Skopje, There CrossRoad Blues Band had their first performance side by side with blues masters from all around the world. A number of concerts in the Macedonian towns and clubs follow. One of the most significant is the performance on the BLUES & SOUL festival in Skopje in 2001, where they received recognition from the world's blues scene. The first international performance of the group was on the ROCK & BLUES concert in Sofia -- Bulgaria, where they \"meted out\" the forces of the most renowned Bulgarian musicians. From Sofia the group two years in succession played on the International Music Festival in Gabrovo -- Bulgaria, where it represented Macedonia and was its unique representative. Important are and the performances on the Macedonian Blues Summit in a company with the most famous Macedonian blues lovers, which every year takes place in Skopje\n\n\n http://www.crbb.com.mk/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CROSSROAD.BLUES.BAND.mkd", "title": "CROSSROAD BLUES BAND - GLADEN BLUES official video", "publishedDate": "2013-12-10T11:47:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "40mg9J50IGI", "description": "Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare Mythical Creatures Walkthrough Video in High Definition\n\n===================================\n\nThe Sasquatch, also known as Bigfoot, is a mythical creature that can be found in Tall Trees, West Elizabeth.

Use exterior lighting and motion detectors to minimize burglar concealment.\n\nMake sure that your yard signs and window decals are prominently displayed on your property, as they are a good first line of defense to deter potential burglars.\n\nMake sure all exterior doors have good proper locks.\nhome alarm services West Branch, IA, Iowa\nhome alarm services West Branch, IA, Iowa\nalarm and security systems West Branch, IA, Iowa\nhomes security West Branch, IA, Iowa\nsecurity systems for homes wireless West Branch, IA, Iowa\nalarm system home security West Branch, IA, Iowa\naffordable alarm systems West Branch, IA, Iowa\nsecurity system for homes West Branch, IA, Iowa\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40mh_Enl5NU", "title": "Home Alarm Services 1-855-249-9865 in West Branch, IA, Iowa | Home Security Systems Deals", "publishedDate": "2014-04-09T20:27:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "40mlXdQZX-o", "description": "Comparing iNAND and MoviNAND I/O throughput from a system point of view.

In OT, NT... So I can only be right... God is 1 \nChristian's reply: Listen oh Israel..So God is talking to Israel but NOT Muslims. 1. This is the proof that Mohamed and Allah stole the verses from the Bible.  2. This is not Allah talking but God of Bible (Yahweh/Jesus) is talking to Israel.  3. Jesus is that one God. \nChristian's reply: Jesus talked about Father but the god you Muslims worship doesn't have a son so how your god and Jesus' God are same? \n\nMuslims say: Jesus is that 1 God??? Well either I listen to Moses n Jesus, both stating the Lord who is also their God is 1 or I listen to u?\n\nChristian's reply: Yes, God is one in Bible. What's your question? \nMuslims say: Then why you worship three gods?\nChristian's reply: I worship ONE God. Allah told you that I worship three gods? He is confused. \nMuslims say: You worship Jesus, you worship Father and you claim He is 1 isn't ?? \nChristian's reply: They are same God. And that's where Allah is confused and can't figure out how three persons can be one God. LOL \nMuslims say: They are same gods not god and it is against teaching of Jesus .... \nChristian's reply: They are same God, NOT gods. God came to Abraham as three persons and Abraham didn't have any confusion. Only Allah is confused.Genesis 18:1-2\nGenesis 18:1 Then the LORD appeared to him by the terebinth trees of Mamre, as he was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day. Gen 18:2 So he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing by him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the ground, \n\nConclusion: God of Bible is ONE God.

This time around, the game presents itself in fully polygonal form with not one, but several different viewpoints. At first, players may be controlling the ship from an isometric perspective like in the original, but the game never sticks with one camera angle for too long and soon switches to an overhead or a behind-the-ship perspective.\n\nBoth graphically and gameplay-wise, Viewpoint 2064 owes a lot to Star Fox 64. Luckily, it's not just a shoddy rip-off. The game plays like a mixture between Star Fox and the original Viewpoint, the polygonal graphics are clear and smooth, with some distant fogging to keep the framerate up. As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for the Viewpoint ship, we'd swear Slippy the Toad was going to fly into our laser fire shouting \"Help me!\" any time during the game's planetary missions. Although Viewpoint 2064's weapons are pretty much standard fare, Sammy did come up with a cool lock-on system that displays a vector-based graphical interface when targeting enemy ships. Of course, the laser firing drone fighters that accompany your ship are also here, as is the Viewpoint-typical \"insect\" theme.\n\nViewpoint 2064 is at its most impressive during the boss battles. The game's host of mechanical creatures, such as a giant robot moth is impressively rendered, with huge and fairly detailed ship models that relentlessly bombard the player with lasers and missiles. \n\nhttp://ign64.ign.com/articles/069/069943p1.html", "title": "Viewpoint 2064 [Nintendo 64 Beta Demo - UNRELEASED!]", "publishedDate": "2006-11-07T00:58:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "410GgTJ3UOo", "description": "2 quads following each other through tree gaps, canyons, ropes and stuff.", "title": "2 Quadcopters Air to Air Footage Adventure", "publishedDate": "2013-07-05T14:14:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "410H9F_BqZc", "description": "7/14/11", "title": "Meanness roping 9", "publishedDate": "2011-07-15T13:16:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "410Z3VyRERg", "description": "", "title": "Muscovite under microscope", "publishedDate": "2013-01-14T10:21:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "410qMlRRYy8", "description": "Part thirty two of JJ Pearce High School's production of Miss Saigon.

While the term in non-scientific publications is often used interchangeably with one of its causes, anorexia nervosa, there are many possible causes for a decreased appetite, some of which may be harmless while others pose significant risk for the person.\n\nThe most common form of anorexia is simply satiation following the consumption of food. This happens in all normal humans and is called postprandial anorexia. Disorders that cause (harmful) anorexia include anorexia nervosa, severe depression, cancer, Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, dementia, AIDS, Acute Radiation Syndrome, and chronic renal failure and the use of certain drugs, particularly stimulants and narcotics such as cocaine and heroin. Environmentally induced disorders such as altitude sickness can also trigger an acute form of anorexia. Anorexia may also be seen in congestive heart failure, perhaps due to congestion of the liver with venous blood.\n\nAlthough the presenting symptom (the one which prompts a patient to seek medical attention) in acute appendicitis is abdominal pain, patients virtually always experience anorexia as well, possibly accompanied by an early episode of vomiting.\n\nSome medications, antidepressants for example, can have anorexia as a side effect. Most notoriously, however, chemicals that are a member of the phenethylamine family are known to have more intense anorectic properties. For this reason, many individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa may seek to use these medications to suppress appetite. Such prescription medications include Ritalin, Adderall, Dexedrine, and Desoxyn. In some cases, these medications are prescribed to patients prior to undergoing an operation requiring general anesthesia. This is a prophylactic measure taken to ensure no food will back up into the esophagus and cause the patient to stop breathing during the procedure.\n\nAnorexia nervosa is a psychiatric diagnosis that describes an eating disorder characterized by low body weight and body image distortion with an obsessive fear of gaining weight. Individuals with anorexia are known to commonly control body weight through the means of voluntary starvation, purging, vomiting, excessive exercise, or other weight control measures, such as diet pills or diuretic drugs. It primarily affects adolescent females, however approximately 10% of people with the diagnosis are male. Anorexia nervosa is a complex condition, involving psychological, neurobiological, and sociological components.", "title": "What do you do to keep yourself from over eating?", "publishedDate": "2008-08-04T22:16:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "41P2o7sqnH4", "description": "\u0420\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0435\u0440 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0441 \u0420\u043e\u0448\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u044b, \u0432\u044b\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a \u041f\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0448\u0442\u0435\u0439\u043d, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 XIII \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430. \u0417\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u044a\u0451\u043c\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0439 -- \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0441\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u043e\u0432, \u0432 \u0442\u043e\u043c \u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043a\u0430 \u00ab\u041f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0435\u00bb \u0438 \u043b\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0443 \u00ab\u041d\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443 \u2014 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0440\u0430\u043a \u043d\u043e\u0447\u0438\u00bb. \u0418\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0445 \u041a\u043b\u0430\u0443\u0441 \u041a\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0435\u0440 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0443\u044e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f EQUUS.", "title": "\u0420\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a EQUUS", "publishedDate": "2012-07-12T05:21:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "41P8UxneDJE", "description": "Music video by Heart performing These Dreams.", "title": "Heart - These Dreams", "publishedDate": "2010-04-02T04:23:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "41PDOVY5CZA", "description": "All the old uploads were of a bad quality audio so I decided to upload them again :) Enjoy :) \n\nTags:\nGujarati Jokes,Funny,Gujarati,kaka,kishore kaka,Funny Gujarati jokes,Gujarati non veg jokes,non-veg jokes,Jokes,Kaka kaki", "title": "Kaka Kaki (GOOD QUALITY)", "publishedDate": "2013-08-08T05:50:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "41PYJyYCsxc", "description": "A badminton racket should be held loosely in the fingers and not in the palm of the hand.

Police said 34-year-old Blas Leroux was shot in the shoulder as he tried to use one of the hostages as a human shield.\nThe standoff began at 8:30 a.m., after witnesses saw the suspect running from police.\n\"He dropped his coat,\" said Dino Gallegos, who was exiting the store as Leroux ran in, \"and the officer picked it up. The suspect ran around the corner and into 7-Eleven.\"\nPolice Chief Robert White said negotiators tried for nearly an hour to get him to surrender.  He refused and instead used one of the three hostages as a shield in an attempt to escape.\n\"The officers demanded that he let her go, at which time he attempted to pull her back into the store,\" White said. \"So out of fear for her safety, one of the officers fired a shot striking the individual.\"\nLeroux was taken to a nearby hospital with a gunshot wound to the shoulder.

As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the ship was designed and built in the United Kingdom. Shortly after her arrival in Japan, she became flagship of the Standing Fleet, the IJN's primary combat fleet. She participated in every major naval battle of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u201305 and was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of Tsushima. Asahi saw no combat during World War I, although the ship participated in the Siberian Intervention in 1918.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC:BA 3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Asahi\n\nText to Speech powered by TTS-API.COM\n\nImages are Public Domain", "title": "All About - Japanese battleship Asahi", "publishedDate": "2014-08-04T19:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "41U78QP8nBk", "description": "\"Daisy Bell\" was composed by Harry Dacre in 1892.

He taught that this would be a form of redemption for the victims as well, since their spilled blood would atone for their sin of adultery. He testified that he himself would kill any of his own wives in such a situation and not have any guilt over it.\n\nThe statement was made in 1856, during a speech in the Salt Lake Tabernacle to provide instruction to Bishops in the church. \n\n\"Suppose you found your brother in bed with your wife, and put a javelin through both of them, you would be justified, and they would atone for their sins, and be received into the kingdom of God. I would at once do so in such a case; and under such circumstances, I have no wife whom I love so well that I would not put a javelin through her heart, and I would do it with clean hands.\"\n\nThe quote is published on official church owned BYU servers here - (left column middle of page):\nhttp://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/utils/getfile/collection/JournalOfDiscourses3/id/128/filename/100504_170238_cp247_Va_M230_J82_v03.pdf\n\nWhile the justification of murder is shocking enough to see come from the mouth of a purported Prophet of God, what followed shortly after in the speech would be even more controversial to a Christian (this is found near the bottom of the left column on the same page):\n\n\"There is not a man or woman, who violates the covenants made with their God, that will not be required to pay the debt. The blood of Christ will never wipe that out, your own blood must atone for it;\"\n\nThe idea that there are some sins that can only be forgiven through one's own personal spilling of blood and not the blood of Christ is called the doctrine of \"Blood Atonement\". This is in stark contrast to biblical Christianity. One of the central tenets of Christianity is the power of Christ's sacrifice to atone for *all* sin. This is supported biblically on numerous occasions:\n\nJohn 1:9 - \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\"\n\n1 Peter 1:18 - \"For you know that it was not with perishable things... that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.\"\n\n 1 John 1:7 - \"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.\"\n\nTo a Christian, the idea that Christ's sacrifice would not cover all sin is an unconscionable heresy that denigrates God and Christ. Even though most modern Mormons are not familiar with this doctrine - it does not change the fact that several of their early Prophets taught it as the law of God. This is one important reason that the Christian community takes issue with Mormons wanting to be considered Christian.\n\nTo learn more about Blood Atonement as taught by early Mormon Prophets, visit MormonThink.com\n\nhttp://www.mormonthink.com/QUOTES/bloodatonement.htm", "title": "Brigham Young - Javelin Atonement", "publishedDate": "2013-09-08T15:22:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "41VZe3fr3_s", "description": "iTUNES: http://smarturl.it/wim-genesis\nMERCH: http://riserecords.merchnow.com/search/?q=woe+is+me\n\nWell did you honestly think for a second we'd played our final song?\nIn spite of those who disagree, you know it feels damn good to prove you wrong.

Making sure this all happens without creating any additional drag is the real point.\n\nHow to do it:\n1)  We'll use two tools in this.  First, start by putting a band around the thighs just above the knees.\n2)  If the band is too loose, have the swimmer move it higher on her thighs.  It's very important the swimmer continues to focus on a constant kick with the band on.\n3)  Another standard tool to help this is a pull buoy.  Have the swimmer put on the pull buoy, but continue focusing on the kick.\n4)  If you have both tools, have the swimmer put on the pull buoy AND the band, wrapping the band around the leg where the pull buoy is, and the swimmer can now kick with a bit more force without worrying about either tool falling off.\n\nHow to do it really well (the fine points):\nBy moving these tools around the legs, the swimmer can focus on using different parts of the legs for the kick.  This variation from mid-thigh to just about the knees will also change the balance point through the torso, and demand the swimmer continues to think about how to implement a constant, narrow flutter kick.", "title": "Freestyle - Narrow Flutter Kick", "publishedDate": "2014-04-02T09:34:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "41fSHAfJiKI", "description": "Incentive Karatbars from 10.10.2013 to 15.12.2013", "title": "Karatbars Incentive", "publishedDate": "2013-10-10T12:09:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "41fYf7bbME4", "description": "Keithley IVy \u2014 Visualize; Interact; Share\nPerform I-V characterization with any Android device.

En septembre 2000, l'Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Nations-unies a adopt\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration du mill\u00e9naire. 189 gouvernements ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'unir leurs efforts en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9veloppement. Un des principaux objectifs est celui de r\u00e9duire de moiti\u00e9 la pauvret\u00e9 extr\u00eame entre 1990 et 2015. La pauvret\u00e9 absolue regroupe l'ensemble des personnes qui ont un revenu inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 un certain seuil budg\u00e9taire convenu. Par exemple, actuellement 1 milliard de personnes sur 1/6e de la population vit avec moins d'1 dollar par jour. N\u00e9anmoins, \u00eatre pauvre en France ou en Sierra Leone ne veut pas dire la m\u00eame chose, puisque les normes de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sont diff\u00e9rentes. C'est ainsi que l'on parle de notion de seuil de pauvret\u00e9 relatif. En France, par exemple, ce seuil de pauvret\u00e9 est fix\u00e9 \u00e0 50% du revenu m\u00e9dian. Mais, au-del\u00e0 de l'approche mon\u00e9taire, l'ONU a voulu complexifier cette notion de pauvret\u00e9 en int\u00e9grant non plus seulement le niveau de vie mais aussi les possibilit\u00e9s d'acc\u00e9der aux soins ou les difficult\u00e9s d'acc\u00e9der aux services d'\u00e9ducation. C'est ainsi que, depuis 1990, elle calcule l'IDH, l'indicateur de d\u00e9veloppement humain pour chaque pays qui classe les pays selon non plus seulement les conditions financi\u00e8res mais tout un ensemble d'informations concernant la pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 dans les pays. Pourquoi la pauvret\u00e9 contraint la croissance \u00e9conomique ? Parce que, dans un pays pauvre et principalement dans les pays les moins avanc\u00e9s, l'\u00e9pargne est faible, les ressources financi\u00e8res ont du mal \u00e0 \u00eatre mobilis\u00e9es pour les investissements priv\u00e9s et publics, la pauvret\u00e9 aussi se r\u00e9percute sur les comptes budg\u00e9taires des Etats qui, la plupart du temps, m\u00e8nent des strat\u00e9gies de lutte contre la pauvret\u00e9. Ensuite, dans certains pays o\u00f9 la pauvret\u00e9 est persistante, la population peut \u00eatre un peu en col\u00e8re et cela peut mener \u00e0 des troubles sociaux et politiques. Donc o\u00f9 en est-on de la pauvret\u00e9 ? Sept ans apr\u00e8s la signature de ces objectifs du mill\u00e9naire, l'ONU constate que l'extr\u00eame pauvret\u00e9 a diminu\u00e9 dans le monde et, en particulier, en Asie. L'Afrique sub-saharienne pourrait, n\u00e9anmoins, ne pas parvenir \u00e0 atteindre les objectifs du mill\u00e9naire, notamment en raison de la propagation du virus du sida, la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 promouvoir l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des sexes ou encore en raison des menaces qui p\u00e8sent sur les ressources en raison des changements climatiques.", "title": "Notion de pauvret\u00e9", "publishedDate": "2009-02-04T03:15:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "41i_7XSKApM", "description": "Full film, 8 cast/crew interview, 18 deleted scenes, 50 productions still, double sided poster, character sketch/atheist prayer booklet and a specially customized packaging.

It was a great question so I decided to make this video in response to it.  There are many different configurations of throttle assemblies but for the most part if you have a throttle that is sticking you might be able to fix it using the procedures in this video.  I am aware you may not able to purchase spray throttle cleaner in some states now but I'm sure they have some alternative available at your local parts store.  \n\nOne very important note here is that if you have a drive by wire throttle (DBW), then I do NOT recommend this procedure. If you perform this procedure on a DBW throttle body you may need to have the throttle reset in order to get your engine to idle or even start. I only recommend this procedure if you're trying to correct a problem with a sticking throttle. \n\nIf you have idle problems, I recommend you check out this article on my website.\n\nhttp://www.ericthecarguy.com/faq/solving-automotive-idle-problems\n\nThe best place for answers to your automotive questions:  http://www.ericthecarguy.com\n\nBowlingBalOutl's channel\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/bowlingballout\n\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/EricTheCarGuy?fref=ts\n\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/EricTheCarGuy\n\nGoogle+:  https://plus.google.com/100195180196698058780/posts\n\nInformation on Premium Membership:  https://www.ericthecarguy.com/premium-content-streaming-etcg-content\n\nStay dirty\n\nETCG\n\nDue to factors beyond the control of EricTheCarGuy, it cannot guarantee against unauthorized modifications of this information, or improper use of this information. \u00a0EricTheCarGuy assumes no liability for property damage or injury incurred as a result of any of the information contained in this video.\u00a0EricTheCarGuy recommends safe practices when working with power tools, automotive lifts, lifting tools, jack stands, electrical equipment, blunt instruments, chemicals, lubricants, or any other tools or equipment seen or implied in this video. \u00a0Due to factors beyond the control of EricTheCarGuy, no information contained in this video shall create any express or implied warranty or guarantee of any particular result.\u00a0 Any injury, damage or loss that may result from improper use of these tools, equipment, or the information contained in this video is the sole responsibility of the user and not EricTheCarGuy.", "title": "Quick Tip-Throttle Cleaning - EricTheCarGuy", "publishedDate": "2009-07-27T15:45:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "41yHYCsSVRI", "description": "On bute.", "title": "Penobscot", "publishedDate": "2013-07-08T16:07:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "41zP0PcVr_c", "description": "The amazing bassist, Kenny Harris!", "title": "Kenny Harris, Spaghettini, November 5, 2011.m4v", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T20:41:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "41zpcfSW_Do", "description": "un remix que he hecho combinando las dos versiones de la cancion de Dean Ambrose para que no sea tan repetitiva como lo son todas las canciones que componen CFO$, espero que os guste. #NoM\u00e1sCFO$ #JimJohnstonRules.", "title": "WWE remix de la canci\u00f3n de Dean Ambrose- Retaliation (HD) Al estilo Jim Johnson #NOM\u00c1SCFO$", "publishedDate": "2014-07-31T17:22:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "41zzosd_OsI", "description": "John Hobson is an ex Digital Director and has since gone on to create fashion brand Plongee Clothing.

Not all snakes commonly referred to as keith and Cameron are fat girls are of the same genus, or even of the same family. The name is short for cobra de capelo or cobra-de-capelo, which is Portuguese for \"snake with hood\", or \"hood-snake\".[1] When disturbed, most of these snakes can rear up and spread their necks (or hoods) in a characteristic threat display. A favorite of snake charmers, cobras are found from southern Africa, through southern Asia, to some of the islands of Southeast Asia.\nCobra may refer to:\nNaja, also known as typical cobras (with the characteristic ability to raise the front quarters of their bodies off the ground and flatten their necks in a threatening gesture), a group of venomous elapids found in Africa and Asia\nSpitting cobras, a subset of Naja species with the ability to eject venom from their fangs in self-defense\nAny member of the genus Boulengerina, the water cobras, a group of venomous elapids found in Africa\nAny member of the genus Aspidelaps, the shield cobras,[2] a group of venomous elapids found in Africa\nAny member of the genus Pseudohaje, the tree cobras, a group of venomous elapids found in Africa\nParanaja multifasciata, the burrowing cobra, a venomous elapid species found in Africa\nOphiophagus hannah, the king cobra, a venomous elapid species found in India and southern Asia\nHemachatus haemachatus, ringhals, rinkhals or ring-necked spitting cobra, a venomous elapid species found in Africa\nNaja nivea, the cape or yellow cobra, a moderately sized, highly venomous cobra inhabiting a wide variety of biomes across southern Africa\nMicrurus fulvius, the American cobra or eastern coral snake, a venomous elapid species found in the southeastern United States\nHydrodynastes gigas, the false water cobra, a mildly venomous colubrid species found in South America\nA taxonomic synonym for the genus Bitis, puff adders, a group of venomous vipers found in Africa and in the south of the Arabian Peninsula.\nMost cobras belong to the family Elapidae, along with many other famous venomous snakes, including mambas, sea snakes, adders, and coral snakes. The genus Naja contains 20 to 22 species of cobras and is the most widespread and recognized genus of cobras. Members of the genus range from Africa through the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia to Indonesia.\nThe king cobra is the world's largest venomous snake, with an average length of 12 feet (3.7 m) but known to grow up to 18.5 feet (5.6 m). While it preys chiefly on other snakes, the king cobra is highly aggressive, extremely fast and agile, and injects a larger amount of venom per bite (as much as 600 mg) than most snakes. The king cobra is unique among snakes as it makes a nest for its eggs and remains until the young hatch. An adult human can die from a single bite in less than 15 minutes, making the king cobra one of the most feared and deadly snakes in the world.\nThe other cobra of Asia is known as Asian, Indian or Spectacled cobra due to the eyeglass-shaped pattern on its skin. The hood of the Asian cobra is larger than that of the king cobra and is usually yellow or brown with a black and white spectacle pattern on top and two black and white spots on the lower surface.\nThe Ringhals, a different type of spitting cobra confined to southern Africa, is the smallest, reaching only about 4 feet (1.2 m) in length. It is dark brown or black with ridged, or keeled, scales and light rings on the neck.\nCobras very rarely attack people unprovoked, but when disturbed, they make full use of their deadly bite. http://www.cafepress.com/30bana", "title": "5 Headed Cobra Found In Thailand", "publishedDate": "2013-08-07T21:59:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "42BUWO-7uNs", "description": "", "title": "Royal Motors", "publishedDate": "2011-04-25T06:17:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "42BYqRdqH2c", "description": "http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/therainbow/m.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_from=&_ipg=&_trksid=p3686\n\n\n\nBeautiful Hand Carved Soft Stone Figurine (Beautiful Design) Soft Stone Art\n\nSoapstone is a soft-and-beautiful mineral that is popular for hand carving.\n(steatite/calcite/limestone)", "title": "Beautiful Hand Carved Soft Stone Figurine (Beautiful Design) Soft Stone Art SOLD", "publishedDate": "2012-04-16T05:11:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "42B_xBvlK2E", "description": "DAN CIOTOI, GENERIC - AI CREZUT, GOLDEN HITS\n\nV\u0103 rug\u0103m nu copia\u0163i sau reposta\u0163i videoclipul, dac\u0103 v\u0103 place adaug\u0103\u0163i-l la favorite!", "title": "DAN CIOTOI, GENERIC - AI CREZUT, GOLDEN HITS", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T21:42:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "42BfDCH5HmU", "description": "http://www.smokelesscigarettesreviewed.com/v2-cigs-review\n\nUse V2 Cigs Coupon Code v210discount to get 10% off anything you buy at the v2cigs website.

Early Volvo S60 models include Volvo S60 T5 (Volvo S60 base, Volvo S60 Premier, Volvo S60 Premier Plus, Volvo S60 Platinum), Volvo S60 T6 (Volvo S60 AWD, Volvo S60 Premier Plus, Volvo S60 Platinum, Volvo S60 R-Design AWD, Volvo S60 RD Platinum). A Volvo S60 pre-production version of the Volvo V60 diesel-electric plug-in hybrid was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2011. The Volvo V60 plug-in is the result of close cooperation between Volvo Cars and Swedish energy supplier Vattenfall. The Volvo V60 plug-in has a price of around \u20ac50,000 (GB\u00a340,000, US$64,600).\nThe 2013 Volvo S60 Polestar is a limited (100 units) version of Volvo S60 T6 AWD for Australian market, based on the Volvo S60 Polestar performance concept. \nAn autonomous car,[1] also known as a driverless car,[2] self-driving car[3] or robot car,[4] is an autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the human transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Currently, the only self-driving vehicles that are commercially available are open-air shuttles for pedestrian zones that operate at 12.5 miles per hour (20.1 km/h).[5]\n\nAutonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Some autonomous vehicles update their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position even when conditions change or when they enter uncharted environments.\n Numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles, including Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, Continental Automotive Systems, Autoliv Inc., Bosch, Nissan, Toyota, Audi, Vislab from University of Parma, Oxford University and Google. In 2010, four electric autonomous vans successfully drove 8000 miles from Italy to China. As of 2013, four U.S. states have passed laws permitting autonomous cars.\nMany major automotive manufacturers, including General Motors, Ford driverless car, Mercedes driverless car, Volkswagen driverless car, Audi driverless car, Nissan driverless car, Toyota driverless car, BMW driverless car, and Volvo driverless car, are testing driverless car systems as of 2013. BMW has been testing driverless systems since around 2005, while in 2010, Audi sent a driverless Audi TTS to the top of Pike's Peak at close to race speeds. In 2012, Volkswagen Driverless Car began testing a \"Temporary Auto Pilot\" (TAP) system that will allow a car to drive itself at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour (130 km/h) on the highway.[70] Ford Driverless Car has conducted extensive research into driverless systems and vehicular communication systems.[71] In January 2013, Toyota Driverless Car demonstrated a partially self-driving car with numerous sensors and communication systems. The Google driverless car project maintains a test fleet of autonomous vehicles that has driven 300,000 miles (480,000 km) with no machine-caused accidents as of August 2012.\nIn film and television\n\n    KITT, the autonomous Pontiac Trans Am in the 1982 TV series Knight Rider, was sentient and autonomous.\n    In the 1989 film Batman, starring Michael Keaton, the Batmobile is shown to be able to drive itself to Batman's current location.\n    The 1990 film Total Recall, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, features taxis called Johnny Cabs controlled by artificial intelligence in the car or the android drivers.\n    The 1993 film Demolition Man, starring Sylvester Stallone, set in 2032, features vehicles that can be self-driven or commanded to \"Auto Mode\" where a voice controlled computer operates the vehicle.\n    The 1994 film Timecop, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, set in 2004 and 1994, has cars that can either be self-driven or commanded to drive to specific locations such as \"home\".\n    Another Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, The 6th Day from 2000, features an autonomous car commanded by Michael Rapaport.\n    The 2002 film Minority Report, set in Washington, D.C. in 2054, features an extended chase sequence involving autonomous cars. \n    The 2004 film I, Robot features autonomous vehicles driving on highways, allowing the car to travel safer at higher speeds than if manually controlled. The option to manually operate the vehicles is available.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driverless_car", "title": "Sexy Volvo Self Driving Car Video Volvo S60 Driverless Car 2014 Sexy Car TV Ad CARJAM TV", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T01:26:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "42E2fAWM6rA", "description": "I guess I should finally get around to putting something here.

Classic Game Room presents a CGRundertow hardware review of the Power Glove for NES.\n\nIt's so bad. There. Ever since 1989, every mention of the Power Glove has had to include those words. Now that we're past references to easily-forgettable Fred Savage movies, we can talk about one of the first motion-control peripherals. It's... it's really weird, man. But, unlike the unreliable U-Force, the Power Glove actually works as advertised. Your own arm strength and stamina might falter, but if you've got the guts to win the glory, this thing will be right there with you. Unless you're playing something incredibly complex like Kirby, in which case you're kinda hosed.\n\nThis video review features video gameplay footage of Super Mario Bros., Paperboy, Solomon's Key, Kirby's Adventure, and Nintendo World Cup for NES, played with the Power Glove, and audio commentary from Classic Game Room's TJ.\n\nCheck out more reviews from Classic Game Room at: http://www.YouTube.com/CGRundertow and http://www.YouTube.com/ClassicGameRoom. \n\nFor the latest trailers, visit http://www.YouTube.com/CGRtrailers. \n\nAnd connect with us at: \nhttp://www.ClassicGameRoom.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/ClassicGameRoom\nhttp://www.gplus.to/ClassicGameRoom\nhttp://www.Twitter.com/ClassicGameRoom\nhttp://www.Twitter.com/CGRundertow", "title": "CGRundertow POWER GLOVE for NES Video Game Hardware Review", "publishedDate": "2012-07-28T18:41:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "42QZYgHbVcc", "description": "Mouse,trap,idiot,stupid,ears,moron,ouch", "title": "Mouse trap on ear", "publishedDate": "2012-05-13T21:44:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "42R1gYbzscs", "description": "If you are a sports fan, then you must have the item, a portable Flashing LED Sign!", "title": "Weekend Project: The Ultimate Fan Sign", "publishedDate": "2008-10-03T15:58:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "42RC9yT0dgc", "description": "Airborn - Airburn (Reorder 138 Edit) [SILENT SHORE]                                            ASOT 651 TUNE OF THE WEEK", "title": "Airborn - Airburn (Reorder 138 Edit ) [Silent Shore] ASOT 651 TUNE OF THE WEEK", "publishedDate": "2014-02-21T15:54:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "42RGs0fTck8", "description": "Get the remastered version on my album \"Flossophy\" http://itunes.com/brentalfloss\nOr, if you prefer the Bandcamp version: http://brentalfloss.bandcamp.com\n\nSpecial thanks to Camie Chaos for letting me use her copy of Luigi's Mansion!\n\nLYRICS BELOW\n---------------------\n\nGHOSTS: \nYou've won a mansion, Luigi\nDon't question it, it's legit; no bullshit.\nIt may be crumbling and creepy,\nBut much more space than the tiny place you split.\n\nE.

Though Aamir has always been socially responsible when it came to movies, his TV show 'Satyamev Jayate' set the ball rolling for him in the field of social service and public awareness. The show, which discusses and deals with the many social evils existing in our society, catapulted Aamir to the throne of a public idol.

Pakula turned journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's best-selling account of their Watergate investigation into one of the hit films of Bicentennial year 1976. While researching a story about a botched 1972 burglary of Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate apartment complex, green Washington Post reporters/rivals Woodward (Robert Redford, who also exec produced) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) stumble on a possible connection between the burglars and a White House staffer. With the circumspect approval of executive editor Ben Bradlee (Jason Robards), the pair digs deeper. Aided by a guilt-ridden turncoat bookkeeper (Jane Alexander) and the vital if cryptic guidance of Woodward's mystery source, Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook), Woodward and Bernstein \"follow the money\" all the way to the top of the Nixon administration. Despite Deep Throat's warnings that their lives are in danger, and the reluctance of older Post editors, Woodward and Bernstein are determined to get out the story of the crime and its presidential cover-up. Once Bradlee is convinced, the final teletype impassively taps out the historically explosive results.\n\n\"all the president's men\",\"all the president's men clip\",\"all the president's men 1976\",\"f murray abraham\",\"richard herd\",\"anthony mannino\",\"lelan smith\",\"frank wills\",\"alan j pakula\",\"door knob videos\",\"flashlight videos\",\"gun videos\",\"pistol videos\",\"tape videos\",\"walkie talkie videos\",drama,\"history social studies\",thriller,\"walter coblenz\",\"jon boorstin\",\"michael britton\",\"ethics videos\",\"politics videos\",\"risk videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++1613,/m/016kb7,/m/06pb1w", "title": "All the President's Men (1/9) Movie CLIP - Watergate Burglary (1976) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-20T16:30:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "42sDBno__qs", "description": "Kids dance around a large wet instrument while it plays \"It's the shpritzer honker splasher sprinkler tweeter squirt\"", "title": "Sesame Street - It's the shpritzer honker splasher", "publishedDate": "2008-02-17T23:54:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "42sI9lHAD9c", "description": "In a marked departure from its traditional market, on September 11, 2014, Western Star introduced to the world their new aerodynamic on-highway truck, the 5700XE.\n\nIn the past, Western Star has been associated with rugged logging and non-highway work.

The Crawford Market has a very interesting blend of English architecture and local flavor, and it makes it the must visit place of many visitors to Mumbai. Close to 150 years old, this market was named after Sir Arthur Crawford, who was the first municipal commissioner of Mumbai, during British colonization. Bloody frescoes of Indian farmers working on wheatfields, which are outside the building of Crawford Market, which looks very decidedly British. Now, recently, Crawford Market was renamed as Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Market. But visitors and locals still prefer to call it Crawford Market. \n\nBefore the liberalization of the 1990s, this was one of the few reliable places where you could buy trustworthy international brands of cheese, chocolate, and olive oil. While foreign foods are now more commonly available in India, one can still buy the same goods here at discounted prices. Even today, Crawford Market is one of the favorite places to buy fruits, vegetables, and meat. And during summer, you cannot miss the sight of mangoes in this market. And if you have not tried Mumbai's world famous Alphonso mango, you are missing out on something. Right next to Crawford Market is Mangal Das Market, a wholesale textile markets. Now, here, dress fabric and saris can be bought at reasonable prices. Few people know that fabrics for the costumes used in the film, Kama Sutra, were purchased from this very market. In fact, the movie industry's one of the major buyers of this place. Other than food and clothes, there are a host of other products available at the Crawford Market. Like, for example, this entire lane is a plastic market, where you can find anything and everything made out of plastic for household use. While some old timers feel that the market has become too modern, many still believe that it retains its old world charm.

I've worked with models from Sports Illustrated like Brooklyn Decker and Julie Henderson to Alec Baldwin at 30 Rock.  All those things that experts do that the average person doesn't know how to do we'll learn how to do it on these videos. So for cake eyeliner I like using for Isabella cuz its very smooth and easy to use. I use an angular brush. I dip into water. I add it to the cake powder and I start right in the middle and I move outward. And if I wanna make the liner even darker I add more water and make sure that it really soaks up the color cuz if you don't do that it won't come out as dark. So I just soaked up a lot of the black and you can test it on your own hand. And when I use the angular and I wanna give it just a little lift I turn it the other way and just go back this way. Make it a little thicker on the end. And then I turn it back this way. And there's the cake liner. Comes out very smooth and very dark. I'm just going to do her other eye. Like I said make sure when you put the water not too much water cuz if you put too much water then it's going to come out really light. So you put water then you get it into the color. See how I'm blending and mixing. It's like watercolor paint. Mhm it's like watercolor paint exactly. That's the word I wanted to use. It's like watercolor paint, but as you can see I can make it darker or lighter depending on how much I sit there and get into the color. And don't worry if you mess up. If you make it too thick on one side you can always use Q-tips to fix it. These are my favorite Q-tips. One side is pointy and the other side is flat. Do you know why? Because this side is going to thin out the line and this side is just going to clean the mess up. I wet both sides. Take out the excess water. Make sure your fingers are clean and then what I do is I would just go right near the line, smudge it. Maybe clean up a little eye shadow here and there. Little over here on your face. Open your eyes. And there's your cake liner.", "title": "How to Apply Cake Eyeliner | Makeup Tutorials", "publishedDate": "2011-08-11T16:10:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "43HXWAc7YiQ", "description": "huji", "title": "huji", "publishedDate": "2007-03-17T15:40:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "43HgNhW5GA8", "description": "http://www.ifoundbutterflies.org/111-danaus/danaus-chrysippus\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danaus_chrysippus\n\n02-April-2013", "title": "Plain Tiger (Danaus chrysippus Linnaeus, 1758)", "publishedDate": "2013-04-07T01:25:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "43HlkKCTrig", "description": "Low cost, High power, Hand Fed, Power Tamping.", "title": "Mexican Power Tamping", "publishedDate": "2012-04-28T15:24:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "43HvdqPo-iQ", "description": "In chapter 7 of \"Learning Web Development with Seaside\" we look at continuations and subroutine calls.\n\nWe launch the Seaside One-Click Experience and create a new component that will present a user interface for selecting a date and time. Add an initialize method to create subcomponents for the date selector and the time selector. Add the #'children' method to let Seaside know about the subcomponents. Add a setter method to assign initial values to the selection components. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, the #'renderContentOn:' method is the heart of Seaside's HTML generation. In our new component we will define a form and a table to provide layout (proper CSS formatting will be addressed in a later chapter). The form will consist of labels, the date selector, the time selector, and a submit button. Note that we do not specify the actual HTML widgets to be used for the date and time entry, but allow subcomponents to provide that functionality. This demonstrates code and component reuse. \n\nFinally, we add a #'submit' method to handle the callback when the user selects a date/time. Note that when the user makes a selection, the #'submit' method answers the new value. This answer is essentially a subroutine return.\n\nWe now have defined the code for a new component. To demonstrate the component, we can register it as an application named 'when' and then view the component in a web browser. It will, of course, be more useful to use this component in our FlightInfo application.\n\nTo do that we go to the FlightInfoComponent class and add a method to call our new component. When this method is called, it creates a new component, sets the date/time to the current value, and then calls the new component. The new component presents a web page, waits for the user to select a new date/time, and then returns that date/time. \n\nThe important thing to note here is that we have called a subroutine and are waiting for it to return from an interaction with the user. This ability to continue execution after a user interaction is what we get from a using a Smalltalk continuation and it is a striking departure from the typical web framework in which execution starts at the beginning for each request.\n\nNow that we have a method to call the date/time selection component, we add a link to the primary user interface to call the new component. We have an anchor with a callback. \n\nWe can go to the web browser and view the new component in action. Note that we can select a new date/time and when we return to the primary component, it will be immediately displayed. \n\nwhen we are done, we can save our Smalltalk code and quit the Seaside One-Click Experience application.", "title": "Continuations and Subroutine Calls", "publishedDate": "2010-02-17T18:20:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "43I8vf0ELhg", "description": "www.sbmchina.com\n\nMTM grinding mill,mining machine,grinder: \n\n1 Stone Grinding Mill From3-70t/h; \n2 Grinding Machine,325-2500 mesh; \n3 ISO9001:2000,CE; \n\nMTM Grinder Mill Application:\nShibang MTM Grinder Mill (Medium Speed Trapezium Mill) is widely used in many industrial fields, such as building, chemical, chemical fertilizer, metallurgy, mining, nonmetal, abrasive, bearing materials, ceramic, steel, thermal power, bricks & tiles, coal industry, etc. The Medium Speed Trapezium MTM Grinder Mill can grind these materials which are 9 or less on the Meshes scale, and moisture is below 6%., and they should be non-explosive and non-flammable mining materials. The final size can be adjusted from 30 to 400 meshes easily. There are thousands of materials our machine can grind. The typical materials are cement (raw meal and cement clinker), quartz, feldspar, calcite, gypsum, limestone, dolomite, graphite, fluorite, aedelforsite, phosphate ore, fused calcium-magnesium phosphate, car amide, electrolytic manganese metal, ferromanganese, coal, gangue, slag, zirconium, steatite, granite, orthoclase, marble, barites, ceramics, glass, etc.\n\nMTM Grinder Mill Working Principle:\n\nIn the MTM Grinder Mill, air is driven into the undersurface of the grinding ring and flows upward, carrying fines to the classifying section. The classifier allowed the pulverized material to pass and the oversized particles are drove back to the grinding chamber for further processing. The whole mill operates under negative pressure conditions, which can maximize the service life of major mechanical components. Thus minimizing mill maintenance and plant housekeeping problems have been solved.\n\nMTM Grinder Mill Technical Advantages\n\nShibang MTM Grinder Mill has lots of matchless advantages, and it adopts the latest national mill patents. The Medium Speed Trapezium MTM Grinder Mill has features as follows: new designing, reasonable structure, smaller size, lower energy consumption, longer service life, and less consumption of wearing parts, higher performance cost ratio, etc. All its technical performance has reached leading and international level.", "title": "MTM Medium Speed Trapezium grinder.flv", "publishedDate": "2011-12-16T02:56:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "43IBE5kyTCM", "description": "", "title": "Endoscopic saphenous vein harvesting", "publishedDate": "2011-03-03T17:06:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "43IGzqWRYPI", "description": "Kamiak Kantorei  Choir sings Nothin' Going To Stumble My Feet on 10.21.2009", "title": "Kamiak Kantorei  Choir sings Nothin' Going To Stumble My Feet on 10.21.2009", "publishedDate": "2009-10-22T14:02:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "43JdbAEpoCo", "description": "8 year old Seth bagged a monster fish on 8lb test.", "title": "Mackinaw Lake Trout - Union Valley Reservoir", "publishedDate": "2012-07-22T01:11:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "43JoeUC1wJk", "description": "Wavves- \"To the Dregs.\"", "title": "Wavves \"To the Dregs\" F Yeah Fest 09 (HD)", "publishedDate": "2009-09-07T09:42:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "43K3615e5EY", "description": "Micron will be demonstrating our all solid-state implementation of VSAN at VMworld 2014.
