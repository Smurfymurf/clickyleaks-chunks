Der Echinokaktus wird in der Natur bis zu 5 Meter hoch, mit einem Durchmesser von bis zu einem Meter. Diese imposante Gr\u00f6\u00dfe erreicht der Echinokaktus / Kugelkaktus jedoch erst nach Jahrhunderte langem, langsamen Wachstum. Von den wenigen in Zimmerkultur gehaltenen Arten kann man nur bei dem Echinocactus horizonthalonius mit der Bildung von Bl\u00fcten rechnen.\nPflege und Kulturanleitung der Echinokaktus\nLicht / Standort\n\nDer Echinokaktus ben\u00f6tigt das ganze Jahr direkte Sonneneinstrahlung. Ohne das direkte Sonnenlicht bilden sich die langen, sch\u00f6n gef\u00e4rbten Dornen nicht richtig aus.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nDer Kaktus wird w\u00e4hrend der Hauptwachstumszeit gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig gegossen. Der Topfballen sollte gr\u00fcndlich angefeuchtet werden, zwischen den jeweils einzelnen Wassergaben l\u00e4sst man die Oberfl\u00e4che der Erde jedoch antrocknen. In der Zeit der Ruheperiode mu\u00df man das Gie\u00dfen stark einschr\u00e4nken. Man achte nur darauf, dass der Topfballen nicht vollkommen vertrocknet. Wird der Echinokaktus / Kugelkaktus w\u00e4hrend der Ruheperiode zu feucht gehalten, so tritt F\u00e4ulnis an den Wurzeln und an der Basis der Kakteen auf.\nTemperatur\n\nDie Kakteen ben\u00f6tigen zum guten Wachstum Temperaturen zwischen 19 und 24 \u00b0C. W\u00e4hrend der winterlichen Ruheperiode sorgt man f\u00fcr Temperaturen um die 10 \u00b0C. Die f\u00fcr den Echinokaktus / Kugelkaktus erforderliche Mindesttemperatur betr\u00e4gt 5 \u00b0C. Bei niedrigeren Temperaturen k\u00f6nnen braune Flecken an den Kakteen auftreten.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nEchinokakteen k\u00f6nnen in der Zimmerkultur nur durch Samen vermehrt werden. Die S\u00e4mlinge sind nicht schwer heranzuziehen. Die Aussaat ist durchaus lohnend, da die jungen Kakteen recht schnell heranwachsen.\nErde / Substrat\n\nF\u00fcr die Kultur des Echinokaktus / Kugelkaktus verwendet man ein Substrat aus einem Drittel scharfem Sand und 2/3 Erde auf Torf- oder Kompostbasis. Sobald die Wurzeln der Kakteen das Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00df ausf\u00fcllen, sollte man den Kaktus in ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00df umtopfen. Zur Kontrolle des Wurzelwachstums mu\u00df man den Echinokaktus / Kugelkaktus im Fr\u00fchjahr aus seinem Topf herausnehmen. Falls ein Umtopfen noch nicht notwendig ist, sch\u00fcttelt man das alte Substrat  vorsichtig aus den Wurzeln und setzt dann den Kaktus mit frischem Substrat wieder in das alte, gut gereinigte Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00df zur\u00fcck.\nD\u00fcngen / N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf\n\nMan d\u00fcngt den Echinokaktus / Kugelkaktus alle zwei Wochen mit Fl\u00fcssigd\u00fcnger, vorausgesetzt man verwendet ein Substrat auf Torfbasis. Bei Verwendung eines Substrates auf der Basis von Komposterde gen\u00fcgt eine D\u00fcngung innerhalb von 4 Wochen.\nPflanzensch\u00e4dlinge & Pflegefehler\nSchmierl\u00e4use / Wolll\u00e4use\n\nDer Befall mit diesen \u00fcblen Pflanzensch\u00e4dlingen wird \u00f6fter an Kakteen beobachtet. Das kleine, wei\u00dfe, an Watteb\u00e4usche erinnernde Gespinst der Schmierl\u00e4use ist gut auf den Bl\u00e4ttern der befallenen Pflanzen zu erkennen. \nSpinnmilben\n\nTrockene, warme Heizungsluft bietet im Winter ein ideales Klima f\u00fcr Spinnmilben.

Frankie Martinez is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most revolutionary salsa performer/choreographers of our time. Many struggle to find comparisons, invoking such names as Ailey and Tharp when describing the impact of his vision.\n\n    Born and raised in the projects of NY, Frankie dedicated himself to the study of Shotokan Karate, becoming a 4th degree black belt and winning many competition awards before joining the U.S. Navy in 1996. While on military leave, Frankie visited a Florida salsa club, and the modern age of Latin dance was born. Returning to New York, Frankie joined \"The Dance Club\" at Metropolitan Avenue, a ballroom dance school, where he was quickly hired as a dance instructor and soon after managed the Salsa/Mambo Department.\n\n    With less than one year of dance experience, Frankie was invited to join the Eddie Torres' Dancers. Later that same year Frankie performed \"Concierto del Amor\" at Madison Square Garden.

Nate was throwing up\nand not \"going to the bathroom\" as a newborn\nnaturally would.\nTests showed that Nate had been born\nwith a rare form of Hirschsprung's disease\u2014\nhe was missing nerve cells in almost the\nentire intestine. Nate couldn't absorb\nnutrients because his intestine was essentially\nparalyzed.\nPediatric gastrointestinal specialists at\nUI Children's Hospital recognized that Nate's\ncase was serious. The Fishers suddenly faced\nthe possibility that Nate might not live beyond\na few months.\nAt 4 days old, Nate underwent surgery,\nas doctors put in a stoma to drain his small\nintestine. Four days later, surgeons inserted a\ncentral intravenous (IV) line to provide nutrition\nand fluids. Nate's condition steadily improved.\nAt 20 days old, his parents took him home.\n\"We were never treated as if Nate wasn't\ngoing to survive,\" Kristi says. \"All along,\nthey've taught us what to know and what to\nlook for. Just amazing care\u2014Nate continues to\ndo things he wasn't expected to do.\"\nNate has made great strides over the\npast 10 years, but not without challenges. He's\nhad several central line replacements due to\ninfections. In 2007, Nate began having severe\npain, leading to major abdominal surgery in\n2008 to remove some of the paralyzed\nintestine. In March 2010, Nate had most of\nthe remaining small intestine removed. That\nproved to be a breakthrough\u2014today he is\npain-free.\nNate continues to receive almost all of\nhis nutrition and fluids from his IV line. He\nneeds frequent ostomy bag changes throughout\nthe day; Brian and Kristi carefully monitor\nhis hydration levels and other health indicators.\nBut otherwise, Nate is a typical fifth-grader.\nHe likes riding his bike, doing archery with his\ndad, taking part in 4-H activities, and playing\nwith his brother Luke, 4, and sisters Brenna,\n6, and Elisa, 8. Brenna was diagnosed with a\nless severe form of Hirschsprung's disease in\n2004 and, like Nate, comes to UI Children's\nHospital for treatment and follow-up.\nAlthough the Fishers live in northwest\nIowa\u2014hours away from Iowa City\u2014they\nconsider UI Children's Hospital their \"home\naway from home.\"\n\"If Nate's health changes, night or day,\nwe know it's time to make the drive straight to\nUI Children's Hospital, where his team will be\nawaiting our arrival,\" Kristi says. \"It's a very\nblessed place for us.\"\n\"They go above and beyond, every time,\"\nBrian adds. \"It's the place to be.\"\nFor Nate, who wants to grow up to be a\ndoctor who helps other children with gastrointestinal\nproblems, being named a Kid Captain\nis a \"great honor.\"\n\"I'll get to have my picture hung up on\nthe wall and get a Hawkeye football jersey,\" he\nsays. \"I'm just really, really excited.\"", "title": "UI Children's Hospital Kid Captain 2010 - Nate Fisher", "publishedDate": "2010-09-16T19:30:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "BApEBp-6ctU", "description": "Ann Coulter talks to Piers about the new \"Game Change\" book coming out and the revealing information it presents.

A seemingly silly\u00a0Justin Bieber petition has reached President Obama. As we previously reported, actor Drake Bell tweeted out a link to a We The People petition, created last Thursday, encouraging President Obama to have Bieber deported back to his native Canada. Petitioners want Bieber's green card being revoked because of his bad boy ways!

Well when someone repays the loan, the opposite process happens, and money is actually destroyed. It effectively disappears from the economy entirely. \n\nThis is vitally important, because it means that if we, the public, start reducing our debts by collectively borrowing less and repaying more, then the amount of money in the economy will actually start to shrink. \n\nIf we all collectively reduced our debts by \u00a31billion, then the money supply of the economy will actually fall by \u00a31billion. There will be \u00a31billion less money changing hands in the economy. \n\nIf we significantly reduce the debt then the shrinkage in the money supply could actually cause the economy to slow down or grind to a halt... \n--------------------------\nSUBSCRIBE to Positive Money UK's videos:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...\n\nLike us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/PositiveMoney\nFollow us on Twitter http://www.twitter.com/PositiveMoneyUK\nFollow us on Google+ http://www.positivemoney.org.uk/googl...\n\nPositive Money is a not-for-profit research and campaign group. They work to raise awareness of the connections between our current monetary and banking system and the serious social, economic and ecological problems that face the UK and the world today. In particular they focus on the role of banks in creating the nation's money supply through the accounting process they use when they make loans - an aspect of banking which is poorly understood. Positive Money believe these fundamental flaws are at the root of - or a major contributor to - problems of poverty, excessive debt, growing inequality and environmental degradation.

Click on the Link: http://smarturl.it/Flyleaf_1CD | iTunes: http://smarturl.it/flyleaf_iTunes\n\nNew album \u201cBetween The Stars\u201d of the multi-platinum alternative rock band\ndue out on October 31st, 2014 \non earMUSIC under exclusive license to Loud & Proud Records\n\nProduced by Don Gilmore \n(Linkin Park, Avril Lavigne, Pearl Jam, Bullet For My Valentine)\n\nMusic comes to life when it must. It lies dormant and then blossoms in its creator at just the right moment. For Flyleaf, that was definitely the case when they began making their fourth full-length album. \u201cBetween The Stars\u201d will be released on October 31st, 2014 on earMUSIC under exclusive license to Loud & Proud Records.\n\nYou could chalk it up to serendipity, but it simply feels meant to be. Seizing that spirit, the band \u2014 Kristen May [vocals], Sameer Bhattacharya [guitar], Jared Hartmann [guitar], Pat Seals [bass], and James Culpepper [drums] \u2014 immediately thrust themselves into the creative process. The lyrics and Kristen's delivery matched the heavy, hypnotic soundscapes that the band conjured up in the studio. Everything solidified into a clear and cohesive vision.\n\nFlyleaf sought out the production talents of the iconic Don Gilmore [Linkin Park, Three Days Grace, Avril Lavigne], holing up in a Los Angeles studio with him for a month during the spring of 2014. With Gilmore behind the board, they captured a certain \"magic\" that proved both passionate and palpable.\n\nKristen explains, \u201cIt\u2019s about the passion we feel when we first fall in love and our emotions are running high, along with our thirst for this great life and all it has to offer.  There is so much beauty, excitement and hope in this world and when we collide with one another and fall in love, magic happens.  I hope everyone turns this song up to eleven, and sings at the top of their lungs.\u201d \n\nThe fans have been with Flyleaf for the entire ride, beginning over a decade ago.  Along the way, their self-titled debut went platinum and yielded the hit \"All Around Me,\" which also moved over one million digital downloads.  The record spent 133 weeks in the Billboard Top 200, climbing to the Top 15 of the Rock Albums and Alternative Albums charts as well.  Its follow-up, \u201cMemento Mori\u201d, saw the group crack the Top 10 of the Billboard Top 200.  They've touched down for shows everywhere from Afghanistan, where they played for the troops, to sold out gigs around the U.S. alongside everybody from Rage Against The Machine to Deftones to Cage The Elephant.\n\nUltimately, that audience remains closer to the musicians' hearts than ever before.  \n\u201cThis album is a reminder that we're alive,\u201d Sameer declares. \u201cEmbrace life now. That's a recurring theme since our inception. We want people to know they're alive, they're loved, and there's hope. That's what we want to share.\"\n\nKristen concludes, \"I hope it's an album people can listen to for years to come.  We put our hearts and souls into it, and I want them to hear that.\"\n\nTrack list\n \n01. Set Me On Fire\n02. Magnetic\n03. Traitor\n04. Platonic\n05. Head Underwater\n06. Sober Serenade\n07.

He was an active and honest propagator of WAHDAT-E-UMMAT (Unity of Muslim Ummah) and for this cause he struggled in his life till the end. It is his one of the another contribution that he always preached the true essence of Islam, free from any type of negative constraints or influence E.g. schism, exhibition of knowledge, pride or for worldly gain etc. His knowledge was so vast and his memory was remarkable that he used to appreciate the contribution of Ulama (scholars) without any discrimination whether they are Brailvi, Deobandi or Ahle Hadees or whoever else. Maulana Ishaq is equally popular among the youth and the old ones. He is liked among Religious or Liberal class through his teachings/lectures to seek guidance from it. \n\n\nMaulana Mufti Ishaq rahmatullah ailah never associated him to any group (Maslak) instead he always called himself a Muslim and his all lectures are purely related to the original primitive teaching of Islam. He always addressed the issues of the questioners and provided them with best solution. This could only be possible if the Religion (ISLAM) is taken into his complete sense.\n\nHis efforts are appreciable and unforgettable. May Allah bless him with Jannat ul firdous .

\"meeting Nato's 2% of GDP spending target\" - and was providing \"leadership\" within the organisation.\n'Threats on doorstep'\n\nIn a speech later at the Royal United Services Institute, a defence think tank, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is expected to call on Nato countries to increase military spending.\n\n\"Not only is there a real risk of equipment obsolescence amongst Nato's European allies, but investment underpins our vital transatlantic bond,\" he will say.\n\n\"Nato was formed on the basis that Europe would pay her way.\n\n\"Like any insurance policy, defence only pays out when you pay in. \n\n\"US taxpayers won't go on picking up the cheque if we choose to prioritise social welfare spending when the threats are on our doorstep.\"\n\nBBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said the comment on threats was a reference to Russian military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nThe MoD said the hi-tech Scout vehicles would be the Army's \"eyes and ears\" on the battlefields of the future.\n\nDelivery of the first Scout vehicles is expected in 2017, with a brigade ready to deploy by the end of 2020.\n\nGeneral Dynamics, a US-based firm, said the Scout was a \"highly-agile, tracked, medium-weight armoured fighting vehicle\" which would offer \"state-of-the-art\" protection to troops.\n\nThe deal is expected to sustain 300 jobs in Wales.\n\nKevin Connell, vice president of General Dynamics UK, who runs the Scout SV programme, told BBC Wales: \"We have a really talented workforce of more than 200 and we expect down the line when we start production for that to grow even further.\"\n\nHe said they were completing the final critical design reviews over next few months and hoped to start production in 2017, running right through to 2024.\n\n\"If the MoD exercises that production option, we're looking at 10 years solid work here and probably beyond that when you consider other variants and export opportunities.\"", "title": "\u00a33.5 Billion armoured vehicle deal to be signed At Nato Summit.", "publishedDate": "2014-09-03T10:45:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "BBb64krhMgo", "description": "Drawing two vanishing points in 2D design establishes realistic 3D perspective on paper.

I run a Muay Thai-style fighting gym in New York City called The Wat. We have some of the world champion fighters that trained at The Wat. If you want to find out more about The Wat, you can contact us at thewat.com. Today we're gonna be talking about the UFC. Elbow techniques.  Elbow techniques, there are a couple of ways of explaining elbow techniques.  There is the close quarters technique.  In tai boxing I try to define the word of elbow more as the very very tip of the elbow.  This is the forearm, this is the elbow.  This is the striking point you want to use in tai boxing.  A lot of times you'll see in a tai boxing fight you'll see two guys moving, you'll see his arm do this, then you'll see the other guy is bleeding.  What happened?  It's not so much of a big forearm smash, it's more of the boom right at the edge.  That's the technique you want to work on doing with an elbow strike.  You want to really connect with the tip of the elbow.  It may not feel very hard it may not have a really big impact but it has a lot of qualities to finish the fight.  As I was saying if I want to hit an elbow from here which is a close in technique, you can go to far into it and you're hitting him with your forearm which is still a decent technique.  But maybe I want to cut him up.  I want to close his eyes for whatever reason.  I'm trying to win a fight, trying to break his nose even.  I'll throw the elbow and I want to hit him right with the tip.  That tip if it hits the side of his eye there, it's going to cut it.  Same thing if I hit it this time going for his nose.  If it hits the bridge of his nose, it's going to break.  If I'm going for his chin, same thing.  Hit with the tip, going for the tip of the chin.  Every time you hit with this elbow, you want to just catch with this tip there.  If that hit on my eyebrow, it would just slice through it.  The bridge of my nose, like I explained, looking for a break.  Side of the cheek, chin: looking for a knockout.  This? I can take that.  Yes a forearm hit can knock the person out.  This kind of an elbow with a tip, you're looking for a cut.  If you do catch the chin, clean, you'll get the knock out as well with that.", "title": "How to Use Your Elbows to Strike | UFC Training", "publishedDate": "2011-09-02T17:33:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "BBlGo1boA04", "description": "http://www.thegrommet.com/anne-koplik-designs-vintage-inspired-statement-rings\nThe Grommet team discovers Anne Koplik's line of vintage inspired costume rings that are timeless, classic, and always invite conversation.", "title": "Anne Koplik Designs - Vintage Inspired Rings", "publishedDate": "2012-08-31T23:21:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "BBlJpWSRbMA", "description": "www.tourfactory.com/848206/r_www.youtube.com\n\n17462 S HALITE LOOP\nCoeur d'Alene, ID 83814\n\nContact Sarah Mitchell for more information.\nTomlinson Sotheby's International Realty\n208 290-3402\n\nThis is your opportunity to own a furnished member cabin.

Thank you for holding today's hearing -- the second in the series exploring ideas for reducing barriers to capital formation and I thank each of the witnesses for being here today. One of the most important functions of this Committee is to promote initiatives to increase access to capital for our small businesses and startups.  \n\n\"It is appropriate that the Capital Markets subcommittee will again lead the way on initiatives to increase capital access and promote economic growth after it championed the enactment of the JOBS Act in the last Congress.  While the JOBS Act was an important step forward, these hearings show that more still needs to be done to ensure that we remove costly and unnecessary regulatory impediments that are restricting companies from accessing capital in the public and private markets.  \n\n\"I especially look forward to testimony from our witnesses about the eXtensible Business Reporting Language, which was mandated by the SEC in 2009.  Despite the SEC's intent of lowering the costs of capital for smaller companies and providing more efficient access to information for investors, this requirement has become another example of a regulation where the costs far outweigh any potential benefits. Companies expend tens of thousands of dollars or more complying with the regulation, yet there is evidence that less than 10 percent of investors actually use XBRL, further diminishing its potential benefits.   \n\n\"This is another example of an unnecessary and costly requirement that dis-incentivizes innovative companies from accessing the public markets. We must look at solutions to this issue and others to create a regulatory environment that is more efficient and conducive for long-term economic growth.\n\n\"I appreciate this Committee's continued focus on ensuring that our small businesses and startups have the ability to access the necessary capital in order to innovate, expand, and create the jobs that our communities need. \n\n\"I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses and thank you again for your appearance before the subcommittee today.  \n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Namun, bagaimana jika ada anjing berpredikat \" Pocket-sized pooch\" atau Anjing yang berukuran Pocket (saku) ? Seperti apakah gambaran Anda ??\n\n\n\nIni merupakan kisah anak anjing yang sangat kecil bahkan berkali-kali lebih kecil dari ukuran anjing normal yang berhasil hidup setelah menderita pneumonia. Anjing tersebut menjadi bahan perbincangan media sosial di inggris bukan hanya karena ukurannya yang sangat kecil tapi juga mengenai pneumonia yang di derita olehnya.\n\n\n\n\nDi kutip dari wikipedia, Pneumonia adalah kondisi inflamasi pada paru\u2014utamanya memengaruhi kantung-kantung udara mikroskopik yang dikenal sebagai alveolus.\n\nBelle, ya nama anjing itu adalah Belle, yang tinggal di Great Yarmouth, Inggris, telah bertahan hidup meski lahir dengan tubuh yang sering sakit-sakitan. Anak anjing mungil tersebut sempat menderita pneumonia saat lahir. Namun pemiliknya , selalu membawa belle berobat ke dokter , karena dia percaya bahwa anak anjing tersebut dapat sembuh.  Karenza Cruse, dia lah pemilik belle, seorang wanita berumur 34 tahun. Selain selalu membawa belle ke dokter , dia tak henti-hentinya mengawasi belle dan tak lupa dia juga selalu memberi belle makan untuk tiap jam nya agar belle tetap memiliki energi.\n\n\n\n\nBelle membutuhkan waktu yang lama untuk melawati masa-masa sakitnya. Namun, setelah melewati beberapa waktu dari masa pengobatannya, akhirnya anak anjing nan mungil tersebut bisa hidup dengan sehat.

Mutual consent or a meeting of the minds is both parties to the contract understanding and agreeing to the contract. There are different levels of mutual consent, the highest being genuine assent. Genuine assent means a person is happy about the terms and conditions of a contract or is in full agreement with the terms and conditions of the contract. Mutual consent means that a person is agreeing to follow the terms of a contract but might not really like them much. The lowest level of mutual consent is no mutual consent at all, but being forced to sign or agree to a contract. Signing or agreeing to a contract against one's will because of force or the threat of violence is duress. Menace is the threat of violence and duress is the feeling that menace produces.

It is a unique story told through the eyes of several of Michael's closest friends, photographers and stylists that had helped Michael prepare for his planned comeback in 2007.\nIn 2007, after several years of living over-seas in seclusion, Michael returned to the United States wanting to make a comeback onto the music scene. Taking the cover of L'UOMO Vogue for its October 2007 issue was Michael's first step. On September 14, 2007 in New York, Photographer Bruce Weber and Vogue Fashion Editor / Michael Jackson's personal stylist Rushka Bergman captured the magic of the King of Pop for the 25th Anniversary of the release of Thriller.\nOn September 24, 2007 in Brooklyn, NY, Michael Jackson did an interview and another photo shoot for Ebony Magazine for its December 2007 issue. This was Michael's first United States interview and magazine story in a decade.\nMichael had a love for art and being an artist himself, Michael had said that he had wanted to be photographed in a space \"where art lives on forever.\" Ebony selected the Brooklyn Museum of Art as the location. While many magazine covers were done throughout Michael's career, the Vogue and Ebony shoots were very important to Michael as these were for his comeback.

Reuters reports that around three dozen weed shops \u2014 or dispensaries \u2014 opened their doors to the public at 8 a.m. on January 1, making it the place in the United States where a person aged 21 and above can legally purchase marijuana without any reason except that they like to smoke it.\n \nLines formed around some of the newly licensed shops as patrons eagerly awaited the end of marijuana prohibition in this U.S. state, a decision approved by voters in a referendum last year. State officials say they expect the weed market to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue, with some estimates putting the figure as high as half a billion dollars. Taxes collected from these sales could earn the state as much as US$70 million dollars per year.\n \nWhile there are other places in the world that have decriminalized marijuana, Colorado has taken legalization a step farther, treating weed exactly the same way the law treats other \"adult\" substances such as alcohol.\n \nAs of Wednesday the licensed production and sale of pot and pot-infused foods or drinks is 100 percent legal, with adults being able to purchase up to 28 grams of the product. Coloradoans are also allowed to grow six weed plants at home for personal consumption.\n \nWashington state looks set to follow suit later in the year, albeit with slightly different regulations. Pro-legalization advocates say as many as 15 other states could be moving in the direction of legalization, and there's no doubt many will be watching what happens in America's \"Rocky Mountain State\" as they decide what to do.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

All his life he's dreamed of discovering a great band and then one day, trawling through YouTube, he finds them... 'The Premature Congratulations'. He hunts them down and offers them his management services. They are young, arrogant, sexy and utterly magnificent. Putting their demo on a cassette tape, Dixie heads out onto the streets of London...\n\nInnocent, wide-eyed Dixie embarks on a roller coaster ride through the most 'infamous' industry of them all.

Every day is a battle for Dixie, totally broke and working for nothing to get his beloved band gigs, their egos grow with their stardom. The more successful 'The Prems' get, the greater the chances are of Dixie losing them. He has to decide what are his real priorities in life... his love of music or his love for Michelle.\n\nA feel-good British comedy with a heart of gold and a soundtrack to match (featuring music by The Stone Roses, The Coral, Jake Bugg, The Libertines and The Prems).\n\nFollow Skins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/skins \nand Facebook https://www.facebook.com/skins", "title": "Svengali Official Trailer (2014) Martin Freeman, Vicky McClure, Matt Berry", "publishedDate": "2014-03-14T16:00:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "BCLbYbbOKVU", "description": "http://www.ivfgenesis.com/\nhttp://www.1testtubebaby.com/\nhttp://www.best-hospital-infertility.com/\n\nHysterosalpingography - GFRC Erode\nIt is a preliminary procedure for any infertile couple and it is\ndone in our centre (GFRC- MMCH , ERODE) since last 18 years.\nhttp://www.ivfgenesis.com/", "title": "Hysterosalpingography - GFRC Erode", "publishedDate": "2013-03-27T12:23:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "BCLfSlSg8rM", "description": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Design-stage-2/449284138468632?ref=hl\nhttp://www.designstage2.blogspot.com/", "title": "anthropometry 2", "publishedDate": "2013-03-02T17:27:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "BCLuIXTLGr4", "description": "Inouk.

Mott Children's Hospital Congenital Heart Center, talks about her abstract presentation at the Cardiology 2014 conference: \"Immune Abnormalities in Fontan Protein-losing Enteropathy and Plastic Bronchitis: A Case Control Study.\"\n\nAbstract Summary: Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) and plastic bronchitis (PB) are complications of the Fontan palliation that carry significant morbidity and mortality. Case reports have described immune abnormalities in these diseases but have been limited by incomplete immune characterization and lack of a control group. Study authors aimed to completely characterize the immunologic profiles of PLE and PB patients and compare them to \"healthy\" Fontan patients.\n\nConclusions: While healthy Fontans and those with PB have mild immune abnormalities, patients with PLE have more extensive and severe abnormalities which cannot be explained simply by stool losses. To what extent these abnormalities cause, potentiate or support PLE or lead to significant morbidities will need to be determined by further study.\n\nCardiology 2014 is a comprehensive post-graduate course for all those involved in the care of neonates, children and young adults with cardiovascular disease.

It is the only species in the genus Chelonia. Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world, with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Their common name derives from the usually green fat found beneath their carapace (upper shell).\n\nThe green sea turtle is a sea turtle, possessing a dorsoventrally flattened body covered by a large, teardrop-shaped carapace and a pair of large, paddle-like flippers. It is usually lightly colored, although parts of the carapace can be almost black in the eastern Pacific. Unlike other members of its family, such as the hawksbill sea turtle and loggerhead sea turtle, C. mydas is mostly herbivorous. The adults commonly inhabit shallow lagoons, feeding mostly on various species of seagrasses.\nLike other sea turtles, they migrate long distances between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Many islands worldwide are known as Turtle Island due to green sea turtles nesting on their beaches. Females crawl out on beaches, dig nests and lay eggs during the night. Later, hatchlings emerge and walk into the water. Those that reach maturity may live to age 80 in the wild.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot stock footage archive of Mowgli Productions Pvt Ltd. \n\nWrite to us for licensing this footage on a broadcast format, for use in your production etc Email Us at : themowgliproductions@gmail.com", "title": "Endangered Green Sea Turtle", "publishedDate": "2012-11-20T11:48:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "BCg6DAl3ovU", "description": "\u548c\u6b4c\u5c71\u306e\u91e3\u592a\u90ce\u3067\u3059\u3002http://www.tsuttarou.co.jp/\n\uff12\uff10\u30bb\u30f3\u30c1\u307b\u3069\u306e\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30aa\u30e4\u30d3\u30c3\u30c1\u30e3\u3060\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u64ae\u5f71\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u305f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u98db\u3073\u51fa\u3066\u6d77\u3078\u3002\n\u300c\u6298\u89d2\u98df\u3079\u3088\u3046\u3068\u601d\u3063\u3066\u305f\u306e\u306b\u3002\u300d\n\u300c\u3048\u30fc\u3001\u30aa\u30e4\u30d3\u30c3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u98df\u3079\u308b\u3093\uff1f\u300d\n\u300c\u4e5d\u5dde\u3067\u306f\u30aa\u30e4\u30d3\u30c3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u9b5a\u5c4b\u3067\u58f2\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3093\u3084\u3067\u3002\u305d\u308c\u3082\u3082\u3063\u3068\u5c0f\u3055\u3044\u3084\u3064\u3067\u3082\u3002\u5c02\u9580\u3067\u6355\u308a\u306b\u884c\u304f\u6f01\u5e2b\u3055\u3093\u304c\u3044\u308b\u304f\u3089\u3044\u3084\u3067\u3002\u300d\n\u300c\u77e5\u3089\u3093\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3001\u3054\u3081\u30fc\u3093\u3002\u300d\nThe fish\u3000\uff12\uff10\u339d\u3000big\u3000Abudefduf vaigiensis \u3000\u3000 which ran out and escaped to the sea", "title": "\u3042\u3042\u3042\uff5e\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u756a\u5916\u7de8", "publishedDate": "2013-08-25T00:39:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "BCgNbmPa4BM", "description": "Comment se pr\u00e9pare le Woop avant d'entrer en sc\u00e8ne ?

A Published Copy of the dance is available from www.rscds.org and www.soldierscharity.org priced \u00a34.  \u00a32.00 goes to ABF The Soldiers Charity (Scotland).\n The Kandahar Reel is a new country dance devised by two serving army officers of The Black Watch as a tribute to their fallen comrades. They devised it in September 2009 while on active service in the Kandahar Region of Afghanistan.  Elements of the dance to watch out for include the \"hands across\"  which symbolise both the Chinook Helecopter and the single blades of a Black Hawk . These figures are normally done once round in four bars. As soldiers are constantly exhorted to give 150%  these figures are done one and a half times in the same number of bars! Other elements to watch out for include; team work and offering a helping hand as they board the helecopter. It is a challenging dance.

In addition to a head scarf, learn how to wear your shawl as a beach cover-up, poncho, evening dress and more by subscribing to KOOSHOO's Youtube Channel. \n\nThe Journey Shawl is hand dyed in the world's only solar powered dye house and is currently available in 5 brilliant colors (Black, Blue, Purple, Grey, White). Designed to be one size fits all, it regularly receives rave reviews for being a shawl that fits every body shape.  \n\nEthically made in downtown Los Angeles, the Journey Shawl is made from 100% Tencel, a soft, silk-like fiber that comes from sustainably farmed Eucalyptus trees. One of the greatest perks of Tencel - beyond it's incredible green properties and soft-as-silk - is the way it drapes from the body.\n\nEach Journey Shawl comes with a positive-affirmation organic cotton travel bag and a portion of profit is donated to a charity that provides yoga and mediation to homeless and at risk-youth, amongst other deserving individuals. \n\nFollow us on Instagram, http://instagram.com/feelingkooshoo, and search #myjourneyshawl to see the Journey Shawl being worn by an eco-fashion community around the world. \n\n[Shop] http://www.kooshoo.com/collections/shawls", "title": "12 Ways to Wear a Scarf or Shawl | #3 The Headscarf Hood", "publishedDate": "2014-07-28T20:11:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "BD27GXVHg2c", "description": "Diffraction par vide.\n\nVideo utilis\u00e9e dans le cadre d'un site sur la lumi\u00e8re http://www.lalumiere.sitew.fr/#Projet_.A", "title": "Diffraction par les trous", "publishedDate": "2011-01-27T12:53:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "BD2EG7RBv74", "description": "Freestyle off of the upcoming mixtape!

I need clear verse no interpretation (in quran there are 100's of clear verses where God say I'm the only God and you must worship me alone), just show me only 1 clear  verse in bible about Jesus asked to be worshiped.\n\n5- if Jesus is God and God died then who controlled the universe?\n\n6- Why does the Bible say that Jesus wanted to die on the cross, when the one on the cross was shouting \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" according to Matthew 27 : 46 and Mark 15 : 34? \n\n7- Christmas = Jesus's birthday then your God has a day of birth; is that make sense to you?\n\n8- Did not Jesus sacrifice himself and forgive our sins,why don't we get all criminals from prison and forgive them if their sins were forgiven? you shouldn't follow your belief?\n\n9- why babies until today still born with Original Sin and they need to be baptized for the forgiveness of sin? didn't Jesus sacrifice for our sins, then why baptism still practicing today? is the sacrifice Jesus made worthless?\n\n\n10-If the Holy Spirit guides Christians only, and they are free to do what they want, then how do we know that the writers of the Gospels didnt make mistakes in writing them? \n\n11- If Christians believe that the Holy Spirit comes and talks to them everyday, why dont they ask the Holy Spirit about which version of the Bible to follow since there are too many versions floating around? \n\n12- How can you as a Christian tell if the Holy Spirit is inside another Christian? How come many Christians fooled people by claiming that the Holy spirit was inside them only to be converted to another religion later on ? \n\n13-  God is Just, and justice requires that nobody should be punished for the sins of others, nor should some people be saved by punishing other people. Doesnt the claim that God sacrificed Jesus to save us because He was Just, contradict the definition of justice? \n\n14- A real sacrifice is when you cant get back what you have offered , so what would be the big deal about such a sacrifice if God could recover the same offering? (according to the Christians terminology)? \n\n15- Do Christians who believe in Jesus yet do not follow his teachings nor repent go to Hell? \n\n16- How come the Bible says that ALL Israel is saved although they dont believe in Jesus? Doesnt that contradict the claim in the Bible that the only way to heaven is through Jesus? \n\n17- Why does the Catholic Bible contain 73 books while the Protestant Bible has only 66? With both claiming to have the complete Word of God, which one should be believed and why? \n\n18- How can you take two gospels from writers who never met Jesus, like Mark and Luke? \n\n19- Why is half of the New Testament written by a man who never even met Jesus in his lifetime? PAUL claimed with no proof that he had met Jesus while on his way from Jerusalem to Damascus. PAUL was the main enemy of Christianity. Isnt that reason enough to question the authenticity of what he wrote?\n\nI have many more questions, if you want I can send them to you.", "title": "Michael Jackson has converted to Islam on 21st November 2008- (Secret behind)-Full story", "publishedDate": "2008-11-22T09:20:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "BD6LXjQ5-Qo", "description": "Buy with Confidence.

In deze hands-on video vertellen we onze eerste indruk met het toestel.\n\nDe Liquid Jade is volgens Acer een beetje ontworpen als een kiezelsteen en moet daardoor lekker in de hand liggen en natuurlijk aanvoelen. De smartphone is bovendien erg dun: 7,5 millimeter. Die combinatie zorgt voor een mooi design dat vooral omdat het zo dun is goed aanvoelt. De Liquid Jade is voorzien van een 5-inch scherm en is dus vrij middelmatig van formaat.\n\nOp het gebied van specificaties heeft Acer het nodige te bieden voor de prijs van de Liquid Jade. De telefoon gaat slechts zo'n \u20ac230 kosten en daarvoor krijg je een 5 inch groot 720p-scherm met ips-technologie. De processor in het toestel is een quadcore MediaTek-chip met een kloksnelheid van 1,3GHz en de telefoon heeft een gigabyte aan werkgeheugen. Aan de achterkant prijkt een 13-megapixelcamera met een groot diafragma van f1.8 en aan de voorkant kun je een 2-megapixelcamera vinden voor de nodige selfies. De Liquid Jade is in twee versies beschikbaar, een dualsim-versie en een singlesim-versie. De smartphone draait op Android 4.4 met Acer's eigen interface er overheen, die redelijk clean is gebleven. Opvallende toevoegingen zijn de pop-up-apps en de Quick Mode, twee functies die overigens niet nieuw zijn voor Acer-telefoons. Wel is de interface van de Quick Mode-functie volledig op de schop gegaan. De Acer Liquid Jade zal waarschijnlijk rond begin oktober verkrijgbaar zijn.\n\nMeer hands-ons?

No words can portray what the eye sees from this majestic and ancient mountain village that has been lost to time for centuries.  One can only imagine the views enjoyed by two reining Kings, Dukes and Baron's from their North and South castellos.  The acqua zolfata spa water is amazing.  Liquid gold.  When the Ancient Greeks' had Sicily, Sclafani*Bagni was the seat, and they found the thermal zolfata water springs so miraculous they dedicated the springs to the god of medicine \"Aesculapius.\"  A 30-40 minute bath and you do not have to sleep that night.  These holly waters have been curing what ails all for thousands of years.  Conte means to bring the views to your living rooms.

This is very old video from a little over 11 years ago. It has been converted from a vhs-c that's why the quality sucks so bad. I was stupid when I was 20 and I payed the price. I definitely needed the lesson because I could have been hurt much worse if my actions persisted. I will not sit here and tell you don't hold venomous snakes cause its your life but what I will say is be prepared to suffer the same fate if not worse. If you hold such things in such ways it is not a matter of if you will get bit its a matter of when. It is not at all the rattlesnakes fault I got bit. \n\nThe only defense any snake has against something it perceives as a threat is to bite. This is not at all trying to glorify what I did but make others aware of the possibility of their actions. This was atrocious behavior and I payed for it with the loss of my finger. My finger rotted away for a week before it was finally removed. While you can see the gruesomeness (kind of, its a crappy video I know) you can not smell the horrible dead rotting smell that came from this. I had to sleep with my arm taped to a chair to keep it elevated above my heart just to help the pain. It was by far the worst pain I have ever gone through in my life. After a week of the rotting I was more than happy to have my finger removed. \n\nSorry again for the incredibly crappy video and the utter stupidity you are seeing in this video. I watch my old, recordings and shutter at how stupid I was. I am very glad I grew up, dumb it had to take me being bitten to see the error of my ways.\n\nP.S. I did not get actual video of the bite itself, the reason for the beginning of the video is to show why I was bit.

(Sorry for the crappy video quality, I was using my cell phone camera, I guess it's alright for a first upload...)\nI measured 20 000 cpm per square meter of wipe today!!! This is the all time record since I have been taking measurements since March 14th 2011 . Previous record was 10 000cpm (counts per minute). \nOne panel I always keep clean, but the other panels collected quite a bit of dirt which seems to increase the radioactivity collection ability. The panels were not radioactive before it rained.\n\nThe decay rate is typically 33min - 45minutes. This matches Radon decay daughter products being selectively washed out of the atmosphere, (hence the variable decay rate.) \n\nWhere is it from? Is it normal? Is it from Fukushima? Is the NWO spiking the clouds with radioactive isotopes for weather modification? Dunno. I all know, is we get cooked virtually every time it rains or snows. The levels are increasing. In the beginning the levels were roughly doubling every 2 weeks. Since the start of the summer the levels stabilized to 3500-5000 cpm per sq. meter every time it rained. But today, yikes! 20 000cpm!\n \nLuckily the decay rate is short and I never detect any residual radiation in the wipes after a day or so. That's what is saving us from being cooked well done.\n \nI've noticed that the worse the storm, the more extreme the weather, the higher the counts, leading me to think that this is done on purpose:\n \nFrom the reasearch I did, Radon is a heavy gas that is 8 times as heavy as air, so it hugs the ground, aprox. 100 meters or less is where it tends to collect. So if this is ground Radon why does the levels increase if it rains all day? \nWouldn't it wash out of the air after 15 minutes or so and then the levels should drop?\n(My area is not known for Radon collecting in basements).\n\n I matched the highest counts with days where the storm clouds were the tallest in the troposphere. This is much too high for Radon to collect. \nIs it being pumped there on purpose? Would Radon daughters charge up and seed rain and snowflakes? Dunno?\n\nIs it coming from space? Radon has a very short half life of 8 days, I don't think it would be floating around in space and stay radioactive for billions of years waiting for the earth's gravity to pick it up...\n\nCould it be traveling from Fukushima via the jet stream? It doesn't make sense, as the Radon gas is 8 times as heavy as air.\nCould it be traveling from Fukushima via ground winds? Maybe?\nCould it be Radon coming from the tailings from the Uranium mines and washing out by the rain? At these levels? Yikes we need to shut down all the mines and cover up the tailings quick!\n \nHas anyone any insight on this? I know what I'm measuring it's real, it's no trick and the radioactivity falling in my area is real... The question is where is it from?\n\nThanks for your time!\n \n :o)\n\n Electrosyl", "title": "(pt3) Radioactivity in rain 20 000cpm / sq. meter Toronto Canada!!!", "publishedDate": "2011-08-14T23:44:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDT7SSQxFng", "description": "Check your flight status and sign up for Flight Status Messaging at www.southwest.com under Travel Tips.", "title": "Inside Southwest Airlines: Flight Planning and Dispatch", "publishedDate": "2009-06-25T19:22:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDTTHiyH2e8", "description": "A likelihood surface over a grid of parameters for tau and omega in a one epoch model of D. melanogaster population growth.", "title": "D. melanogaster demography likelihood surface", "publishedDate": "2008-01-28T04:58:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDTpn6Ralbs", "description": "", "title": "Vlog Depression And Agoraphobia", "publishedDate": "2014-01-18T02:21:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDULkhGN1-U", "description": "v Victory at Backbencher 2", "title": "v Victory at Backbencher 2", "publishedDate": "2007-08-27T09:37:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDUZtsDI2iE", "description": "- Subscribe for all the latest unbiased news: https://www.youtube.com/user/nnisnewsindia \n\nStay up to date with the latest news on your time line.\n Like us on http://tinyurl.com/q837kvj\n\nFollow us on Twitter for unbiased news:\nhttps://twitter.com/NNISNews1 Subscribe for all the latest unbiased news: https://www.youtube.com/user/nnisnewsindia \n\nStay up to date with the latest news on your time line.\n Like us on http://tinyurl.com/q837kvj\n\nFollow us on Twitter for unbiased news:\nhttps://twitter.com/NNISNews1", "title": "Govt Has Opened Way For Rail Disinvestment Sharad Yadav", "publishedDate": "2014-07-09T11:02:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDU_2alPBM4", "description": "", "title": "Unconditional Acceptance & Nurturance", "publishedDate": "2013-09-15T14:38:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDUt4NVIrG4", "description": "An authentic Iroquoian village on property located on Mohawk Street close to Her Majesty's Royal Chapel of the Mohawks in Brantford.

The defining features of the breed are its maximum size of 7 pounds (3.2 kg) and its gray, black, and tan coat. The breed is nicknamed Yorkie and is placed in the Toy Terrier section of the Terrier Group by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and in the Toy Group or Companion Group by other kennel clubs, although all agree that the breed is a terrier. A popular companion dog, the Yorkshire Terrier has also been part of the development of other breeds, such as the Australian Silky Terrier.\nHypoallergenic coats[edit source | editbeta]\nMain article: Hypoallergenic dog breed\nThe typical fine, straight, and silky Yorkshire Terrier coat has also been listed by many popular dog information websites as being hypoallergenic. In comparison with many other breeds, Yorkies do not shed to the same degree, only losing small amounts when bathed or brushed.[8] and it is the dog's dander and saliva that trigger most allergic reactions.[9] Allergists do recognize that at times a particular allergy patient will be able to tolerate a particular dog, but they agree that \"the luck of the few with their pets cannot be stretched to fit all allergic people and entire breeds of dogs.\"[10] The Yorkshire Terrier coat is said to fall out only when brushed or broken, or just said to not shed.[11] Although neither of those statements agree with what biologists, veterinarians, and allergists know about dog fur, allergists \"think there really are differences in protein production between dogs that may help one patient and not another\",[10] meaning that some allergic people may not have allergic reactions to a specific dog, like the Yorkie.\nThe ideal Yorkshire Terrier character or \"personality\" is described with a \"carriage very upright\" and \"conveying an important air.\"[2] Though small, the Yorkshire Terrier is active, very overprotective, curious, and loves attention. Mentally sound and emotionally secure ones should normally not show the soft submissive temperament seen in lap dogs. Yorkshire Terriers, also known as Yorkies, are an easy dog breed to train. This results from their own nature to work without human assistance.\nYorkshire Terriers tend to bark a lot. This makes them excellent watch dogs because they will sound the alarm when anyone gets near. This barking problem can be resolved with proper training.\nYorkshire Terriers are ranked 27th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs.\nThe Yorkshire Terrier breed descends from larger but similar Scottish breeds such as the now extinct Paisley Terrier and the Skye Terrier. In its turn, other breeds have been resulted in high prices being paid for Yorkshire Terriers crossed with various other breeds, which are described with a portmanteau word made up of syllables (or sounds) from Yorkshire Terrier and the breed name of the other parent. A list of such portmanteau-named crosses can be found on the List of dog hybrids page.\nbeen easily attained.\"[19]\nWhat is known is that the breed sprang from three different dogs, a male named Old Crab and a female named Kitty, and another female whose name is not known.[20] The Paisley Terrier, a smaller version of the Skye Terrier that was bred for a beautiful long silky coat, also figured into the early dogs. Some authorities believed that the Maltese was used as well.[21] funny video, viral video, popular video, puppy, cute dog, funny videos, funny animals videos, funny dogs, hilarious videos,\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Videos\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFunny Video\nFail Compilation, viral video, popular video,", "title": "FUNNY VIDEO, YORKSHIRE TERRIER, \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605,  CUTE YORKIE,  FUNNY YORKIE, FUNNY BARKING DOG", "publishedDate": "2013-08-28T05:41:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDdK0CjMIWk", "description": "\"Never Give Up\" is taken from the Chassis upcoming album Social Distortion!

Chimps prefer dense tropical rainforests but can also be found in secondary-growth forests, woodlands, bamboo forests, swamps, and even open savannah. \nBehavior\nChimpanzees are great apes (not monkeys) who are native to the continent of Africa. If you ever wonder if you are looking at an ape or a monkey, look for a tail. Monkeys have tails, apes: chimps, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, gibbons, and humans --do not. Along with bonobos, chimpanzees are our closest living relatives. We share approximately 98% of our DNA with chimps, so it's fair to say that we are 98% chimpanzee, and chimps are 98% human.\n\nChimpanzees are an endangered species. Millions of chimpanzees used to live throughout equatorial Africa from southern Senegal through Central Africa to western Tanzania. This is an area almost the size of the United States. Today, there are estimated to be merely 170,000-300,000 chimpanzees left in Africa, and their population is decreasing rapidly. One recent census in the Ivory Coast revealed that the chimp population there had decreased 90% in just the past twenty years.\nChimps live in communities. These communities are composed of family groups of three to six individuals, totaling about 50 animals. Hierarchies are formed by the adult males of the community, which is led by one alpha (the highest) male. Adolescent females may move freely between communities, although territory is strictly patrolled and conflicts can occur between neighbors.\n\nOn the ground, chimpanzees usually walk on all fours using their knuckles for support with their hands clenched, a form of locomotion called knuckle-walking.\n\nChimpanzee Facts - Facts About Chimpanzees\n\n\n\n101AnimalFacts 101AnimalFacts\n\nChimpanzee Facts - Facts About Chimpanzees", "title": "Chimpanzee Facts - Facts About Chimpanzees", "publishedDate": "2013-10-28T14:40:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDf61yi_f-0", "description": "LIKE US on FACEBOOK\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WBshow\n\nFOLLOW US on TWITTER\nhttps://twitter.com/wbangcaHD\n\nINSTAGRAM\nhttp://instagram.com/wbangcaHD", "title": "Dragon City: Breeding Sanctuary Upgrades New Mirage, Supersonic Dragons!", "publishedDate": "2014-07-17T15:32:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDfm40sBKM8", "description": "Serena Williams is the only -- repeat ONLY -- woman alive who could pull off crashing a beach wedding while wearing a leopard print one-piece swimsuit.", "title": "Serena Williams -- Leopard Swimsuit-Wearing Wedding Crasher", "publishedDate": "2014-06-02T17:52:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDfnQfz-GTQ", "description": "This classic song is taken from the film \"SOCIETY GIRL\".

A recent study by geologists at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado shows that during the Hadean period, Earth was hit by lots of asteroids that created a volatile environment.\n \n\nWhat Earth looked like during its first 500 million years is unknown as we have not found any rocks older than roughly 3.8 billion years, but scientists think our planet was constantly hit by a rain of asteroids that melted the surface and boiled the oceans. \n\nA recent study by geologists at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado has attempted to show what really happened during this volatile Hadean period as it is known. \n\nThe evidence of all the asteroid impacts was covered up over time by erosion and plate tectonics, so to study the conditions of early Earth, scientists looked to the moon. \n\nThey analyzed the frequency of different size craters on the surface of the moon to measure when asteroids of different shapes and sizes made impact. Using this information, they created a computer simulation of the size and frequency of asteroids that may have impacted early Earth including several more than 600 miles wide.\n\nDoctor Simone Marchi of the Southwest Research Institute, who worked on the study is quoted as saying: \"We found that the magma oceans were likely to be regional events, so at any given time there were some locations that were calm. That means liquid water could have existed in one place or another throughout the 500 million years of the Hadean period.\"\n\nThough it\u2019s also possible that life existed at that time, it would have had to survive some harsh conditions.", "title": "What Did Early Earth Look Like", "publishedDate": "2014-08-01T11:55:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDi6Jay0XNw", "description": "Lady A performed a new song off of their next album at the Ohio State Fair.

MacDonald, Wesley Strick, James R. Webb\nFilm Description: Martin Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear provided the director with a box-office success to follow up the critical success of the previous year's Goodfellas. After serving a lengthy prison sentence for a sexual assault, Max Cady (Robert De Niro) comes calling on the man who served as his public defender, Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte). Max begins a campaign of harassment against the man and his family because Bowden buried a report that would have in all likelihood acquitted Cady of the charges against him. Bowden's shaky ethics continue in his personal life as he is considering beginning an extramarital affair with colleague Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), since he and his wife, Leigh (Jessica Lange) have had a difficult time coming back together since he has admitted to previous indiscretions. Cady infiltrates the family most insidiously by cultivating a relationship with the Bowden's troubled teenage daughte, Danielle (Juliette Lewis), who is all the more susceptible to Cady's advances because of her parents' problems. Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck, the stars of the original film, have cameo appearances in this version of Cape Fear. De Niro and Lewis were both nominated for Academy Awards for their work in the film.\n\n\"cape fear\",\"cape fear clip\",\"cape fear trailer\",\"cape fear part 1\",\"nick nolte\",\"juliette lewis\",\"jessica lange\",\"martin scorsese\",\"cigar videos\",\"handcuffs videos\",\"lighter fluid videos\",\"lighter videos\",\"crime dramas\",\"crime thrillers\",drama,\"psychological thrillers\",suspense,\"steven spielberg\",\"robert de niro\",\"barbara de fina\",\"evil videos\",\"family videos\",\"sacrifice videos\",\"boat videos\",\"max cady\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++8064,/m/06cgy,/m/0lkr7,/m/0hsn_,/m/02g0mx", "title": "Cape Fear (8/10) Movie CLIP - Leigh Offers Herself (1991) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01T12:27:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDiYyp06cfo", "description": "Oscar, the driver, from\nhttp://www.comic-oscar.com\nin german, spanish, too", "title": "the lay-by", "publishedDate": "2008-02-05T12:05:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "BDiarxFSv1Q", "description": "This video shows an orthodontic treatment simulation animation with a Herbst Appliance.

Such a discovery could help shine light on the leadership structure of the city, including whether rule was hereditary.\n\n\"We have not lost hope of finding that, and if they are there, they must be from someone very, very important,\" Gomez said.\n\nSo far Gomez's team has excavated only about 2 feet (60 centimeters) into the chambers. A full exploration will take at least another year.\n\nInitial studies by the National Institute of Anthropology and History show the tunnel functioned until around A.D. 250, when it was closed off.\n\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/fc26b9b778ba4770baed1a6da7ca393b/mexico-archaeologists-explore-teotihuacan-tunnel", "title": "Mexican Archaeologists Find 3 New Chambers at End of Teotihuacan Tunnel", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T04:23:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "BE2qaxnzS7k", "description": "My warden sides with the Cult of Andraste and destroys the Urn of Sacred Ashes.", "title": "Dragon Age: Origins Destroying the Urn of Sacred Ashes", "publishedDate": "2012-09-19T01:36:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "BE2t8Lcah8k", "description": "Die 1000 Augen des Dr. Mabuse, aka The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse (1960). \n\nFritz Lang's third in his Mabuse series, and his final film altogether.

Less frequently used is shadowing where ethnographers accompany or follow people as they go about their tasks. However, with the increasing penetration of mobile personal devices like cell phones and GPS-enabled, digital tablets, it is becoming more important for us to understand how technologies fit into people lives as they go about their daily business.

(The previous record was \u00a35,300,000 for a painting sold in London in 1999). It is also the highest price for an Old Master Painting sold at auction anywhere in the world this year.\n\nThe painting was the leading work in the sale of paintings and sculpture from the renowned collection of the German philanthropist, the late Dr Gustav Rau which raised more than \u00a319 million.\n\nThe proceeds will be used to benefit the Foundation of the German Committee for UNICEF -- for the children of the world.\n\nBonhams Director of Old Master Paintings, Andrew McKenzie, said, \"The Portrait of Fran\u00e7ois-Henri d'Harcourt is one of the paintings on which Fragonard's reputation as an artistic genius rests. It is impossible to overstate its cultural and artistic significance. Handling this great painting for sale was a huge privilege and a landmark in the history of the art market.\"\n\nGroup Head of Pictures, Caroline Oliphant, said: \"We were thrilled to do so well for UNICEF. It was a real pleasure to work with this collection, particularly the Fragonard, over the past months.\"\n\nOne of Fragonard's famous 15 fantasy portraits, The Portrait of Fran\u00e7ois-Henri d'Harcourt was the most significant of the artist's works to have appeared on the market for many years. Only two other fantasy portraits remain in private hands making this painting rarer than portraits by Frans Hals, Joshua Reynolds or even Rembrandt.\n\nJean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard (1732-1806) was a master of genre painting and a leading exponent of the Rococo style of which The Swing in the Wallace Collection in London is probably the best known example. In great demand as a portraitist in the dying days of the Ancien Regime, Fragonard fell on hard times after the French Revolution and although he continued to live in France he died in obscurity and poverty.\n\nFragonard's fantasy portraits -- often depicting friends and acquaintances - were painted quickly with bold, fluid brush work which anticipated the Impressionists in bravura and technique. This style was referred to by some contemporaries as the artist's, 'swordplay of the brush'. The Portrait of Fran\u00e7ois-Henri d'Harcourt is unusual among Fragonard's fantasy portraits because the subject is identified. Many of the other portraits are personifications of the arts rather than representations of named individuals.\n\nhttp://www.bonhams.com/press_release/15308/\nhttp://www.bonhams.com/departments/PIC-OMP/", "title": "Bonhams Old Master Paintings: Fragonard portrait makes \u00a317million at Bonhams", "publishedDate": "2013-12-06T10:16:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "BEKLvqo61hs", "description": "\u0540\u0578\u0582\u056c\u056b\u057d\u056b 7 , 19:00 \u0540. \u0544\u0561\u056c\u0575\u0561\u0576\u056b \u0561\u0576\u057e. \u0539\u0561\u057f\u0580\u0578\u0576", "title": "Kentron TV", "publishedDate": "2012-07-09T14:07:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "BEKgyFC8k98", "description": "Embracing Abomination's interview with Shaw TV. \nJuly 26th, 2012, debut live show at Louis' Pub in Saskatoon, SK.\nwww.embracingabomination.com", "title": "Embracing Abomination Shaw TV Interview", "publishedDate": "2012-07-24T16:39:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "BEKtUNbluqo", "description": "Deadpool Funny Wisecrack Marvel Ultimate Alliance Xbox 360 HD", "title": "Deadpool Funny Wisecrack Marvel Ultimate Alliance Xbox 360 HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-24T00:16:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "BELL1xYK38w", "description": "Formatie de nunti Barlad,Vaslui,Iasi,Husi,Bacau,Piatra Neamt,Galati,Focsani,Adjud,Onesti,BUCURESTI,Formatie nunti ITALIA", "title": "Formatia Occident Barlad 2014 Ce seara minunata-TEL.0768.458859", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T14:33:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "BELOjZL3SOU", "description": "Grade eights, this lesson covers our topic for cycle 16 - eighth note sixteenth note combinations, both where the eighth note comes first and where the sixteenth notes come first.", "title": "Eighth note-sixteenth note combinations", "publishedDate": "2013-01-30T15:18:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "BELPjR82W3Y", "description": "F.
