The group's office is in Washington.\n\nThe letters, which contained what the FBI described as \"very low concentrations\" of ricin, were discovered before causing any injuries or fatalities.

I've done it. I've finally vidded an entire song to my FAVOURITE ATLA CHARACTER! RAWR!! Hopefully after this video, you'll see why I love her so much :)\nAlso, I'm just gonna add how extremely hard it is to make a three and a half minute AMV for a minor character. I only JUST had enough scenes to cover the whole song.\n\nAND speaking of the song - I hope you guys really appreciate it. And it was about someone got the guts to edit to this masterpiece. It was created by this TALENTED youtuber who I admire SO much - her name is Adriana Figueroa, and she wrote this one specifically about Yue. But her other stuff is really cool too - she's done avatar parodies of disney songs, and similar works, which are SUPER cool - so definitely check her out, and I hope you're as impressed with her as I was!!!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/adrisaurus\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/adrisaurus\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/adrisaurus\n\nBUY THE SONG - only $1!!!\nhttp://adrianafigueroa.bandcamp.com/track/daughter-of-the-moon\n\nBACK TO THE VIDEO - this took a LONG time to make, because I kept quitting on it since it was so hard. But I've wanted to edit to one of Adriana's songs for AGES - so I stuck to it :3\n\nI was also going to add voiceovers to the instrumental parts, but due to the shit-ass feedback on the voiceovers in my Supermassive Black Hole vid, I've decided to mute them all, so you'll NEVER KNOW!!!\n\nThis one is dedicated to two recent avatar editors whose editing has just shone in their last few videos.

A common problem today is that most people don\u2019t know how to deal with conflict\u2014nor do they understand the source of real peace. As a result, we have become somewhat ignorant. We see the issues around us, but we often choose to ignore them. It seems that most people have a common goal of avoiding conflict at all cost.\n\nPeople tend to define peace as the absence of hostility and anxiety, but the biblical term actually refers to something far broader. The Greek word eirene means \u201cto bind together.\u201d So in today\u2019s verse, peace has the sense of wholeness or inner completeness that brings stability to a person\u2019s walk, regardless of what is happening in his or her life. Jesus spoke not of the kind of peace that comes today and goes tomorrow but of prevailing, or undefeatable, peace.\n\nThe key to lasting peace is found in a relationship. If you want tranquility that is unending, you need to build a relationship with Jesus Christ. We, too, can enjoy the oneness that He and the Father experienced. When the Lord says, \u201cMy peace I give to you,\u201d He is not referring to a loan. His peace is a free gift, available to every one of His children.\n\nIf we focus our attention on the Son of God, He will give us perfect peace (Isa. 26:3). That does not mean we are immune to sudden shocks or occasional times when we are thrown off balance by circumstances. But the power of the Lord\u2019s prevailing peace is adequate to carry us through anything He allows us to experience.", "title": "Prevailing Peace During Conflict", "publishedDate": "2014-10-17T15:27:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "4SUwojqO0YQ", "description": "hello a tous,\n\nPetite vid\u00e9o pour vous montrer mes cheveux au naturel.\nMa transition dure depuis novembre 2012\n\n\u25ba\u25baPour avoir des nouvelles entre deux vid\u00e9os, c'est juste ici:\u25ba\u25ba\n\nI\u2764FB: http://facebook.com/tahiri.sentosa\nI\u2764BLOGGING: http://drop-dead-life.blogspot.fr\nI\u2764TWITTER: http://twitter.com/tahiri_ddl\nI\u2764INSTAGRAM: @tahiriddl\nI\u2764YOU!", "title": "MES CHEVEUX EN TRANSITION", "publishedDate": "2013-03-22T05:15:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "4SVVaEVpbLI", "description": "", "title": "Lo schema Formidabile 2012...Canta Sandro Paudice.", "publishedDate": "2012-12-08T11:10:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "4SW-i2km-Ho", "description": "The Sundarbans (Pron:/\u02c8s\u028and\u0259\u02ccb\u028cnz/) (Bengali: \u09b8\u09c1\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09b0\u09ac\u09a8, Shundorb\u00f4n) is the largest single block of tidal halophytic mangrove forest in the world.[2] The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site covering parts of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal.\nTwo-third of the Sundarbans is in Bangladesh and the remaining third in West Bengal, India. The Sundarbans National Park is a National Park, Tiger Reserve, and a Biosphere Reserve located in the Sundarbans delta in the Indian state of West Bengal. Sundarbans South, East and West are three protected forests in Bangladesh. This region is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is one of the largest reserves for the Bengal tiger.\n\nThe history of the area can be traced back to 200--300 AD. A ruin of a city built by Chand Sadagar has been found in the Baghmara Forest Block. During the Mughal period, the Mughal Kings leased the forests of the Sundarbans to nearby residents. Many criminals took refuge in the Sundarbans from the advancing armies of Emperor Akbar. Many have been known to be attacked by Tigers[3] Many of the buildings which were built by them later fell to hands of Portuguese pirates, salt smugglers and dacoits in the 17th century. Evidence of the fact can be traced from the ruins at Netidhopani and other places scattered all over Sundarbans.  The legal status of the forests underwent a series of changes, including the distinction of being the first mangrove forest in the world to be brought under scientific management. The area was mapped first in Persian, by the Surveyor General as early as 1764 following soon after proprietary rights were confiscated from the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II by the British East India Company in 1757. Systematic management of this forest tract started in the 1860s after the establishment of a Forest Department in the Province of Bengal, in British India. The management was entirely designed to extract whatever treasures were available, but labor and lower management mostly were staffed by locals, as the British had no expertise or adaptation experience in mangrove forests.\n\nThe first Forest Management Division to have jurisdiction over the Sundarbans was established in 1869. In 1875 a large portion of the mangrove forests was declared as reserved forests in 1875--76 under the Forest Act, 1865 (Act VIII of 1865). The remaining portions of the forests were declared a reserve forest the following year and the forest, which was so far administered by the civil administration district, was placed under the control of the Forest Department. A Forest Division, which is the basic forest management and administration unit, was created in 1879 with the headquarter in Khulna, Bangladesh. The first management plan was written for the period 1893--98.\nIn 1911, it was described as a tract of waste country which had never been surveyed, nor had the census been extended to it. It then stretched for about 165 miles (266 km) from the mouth of the Hugli to the mouth of the Meghna river and was bordered inland by the three settled districts of the 24 Parganas, Khulna and Bakerganj. The total area (including water) was estimated at 6,526 square miles (16,902 km2). It was a water-logged jungle, in which tigers and other wild beasts abounded. Attempts at reclamation had not been very successful. The Sundarbans was everywhere intersected by river channels and creeks, some of which afforded water communication throughout the Bengal region both for steamers and for native boats.", "title": "We See The Royal Bengal Tiger at Sunderbans!!!

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Virginia Tech vs Pittsburgh | 2014 ACC Football Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-10-17T04:20:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Svd4xyrdPE", "description": "violent vivisection - vivisection", "title": "violent vivisection - vivisection", "publishedDate": "2009-10-02T12:42:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "4SvgJhXdJnI", "description": "Squats, deadlifts, benchpress :-)", "title": "5/1-14 w strained buttock", "publishedDate": "2014-01-05T20:36:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "4SvmsCwP01o", "description": "Vis\u00edtanos tambi\u00e9n en:\nCharHadas TV - http://videos.charhadas.com/\nFb - https://www.facebook.com/CharHadas?fref=ts\nTw - https://twitter.com/CharHadas\nG+ - https://plus.google.com/+charhadas/posts\n\nEn este v\u00eddeo tutorial aprender\u00e1s paso a paso a hacer un \u00e1rbol de chuches con nubes de colores.

Large molecules synthesized in the cell body, intracellular components such as vesicles, and organelles such as mitochondria are too large (and the cytosol too crowded) to diffuse to their destinations. Most kinesins transport such cargo about the cell by walking unidirectionally along microtubule tracks hydrolysing one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) at each step. It was thought that ATP hydrolysis powered the kinesin walk but it now seems that the force of binding to the microtubule is what pulls the cargo along while the binding of ATP assists the direction of motion.\n\nStructure\n\nThe typical kinesin is a protein dimer consisting of two heavy chains and two light chains. The heavy chains comprise a globular head (the motor domain) connected via a short, flexible neck linker to the stalk - a long, central coiled-coil region - that ends in a tail region formed with a light-chain. The stalks intertwine to form the kinesin dimer. Cargo binds to the tail while the twin heads alternately bind the microtubule as the kinesin pulls the cargo along. The heads will hydrolyze 2 ATP molecules per step.\n\nPolarity\n\nMotor proteins travel in a specific direction along a microtubule. This is because the microtubule is polar, the heads only bind to the microtubule in one orientation, and ATP hydrolysis drives the molecule in one direction.\n\nMost kinesins walk towards the positive end of a microtubule which, in most cells, entails transporting cargo from the centre of the cell towards the periphery. This form of transport is known as anterograde transport.\n\nSome kinesins {EG5}, and a different type of motor protein known as dyneins, move towards the minus end of the microtubule. Thus they transport cargo from the periphery of the cell towards the centre. This is known as retrograde transport. These motors have a different morphology: their structure is such that they move in the opposite direction though the directional principle is the same as for the rest of the family.\n\nProposed mechanisms\n\nKinesin accomplishes transport by essentially \"walking\" along a microtubule. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain how this movement occurs.\n\n* In the \"hand-over-hand\" mechanism, the kinesin heads step over one another, alternating the lead position.\n* In the \"inchworm\" mechanism, one kinesin head always leads, moving forward a step before the trailing head catches up.\n\nDespite some remaining controversy, mounting academic evidence points towards the symmetric inchworm mechanism as being more likely.\n\nAsters and assembly\n\nIn recent years, it has been found that microtubule-based molecular motors (including a number of kinesins) have a role in mitosis (cell division). The mechanism by which the cytoskeleton of the daughter cell separates from that of the mother cell was unclear. It seems that motors organize the two separate microtubule asters into a metastable structure independent of any external positional cues. This self-organization is in turn dependent on the directionality of the motors as well as their processivity (ability to walk). Thus motors are necessary for the formation of the mitotic spindle assemblies that perform chromosome separation. Specifically, proteins from the Kinesin 13 family act as regulators of microtubule dynamics. The prototypical member of this family is MCAK (formerly Kif2C, XKCM1, Gene KIF2C) which acts at the ends of microtubule polymers to depolymerize them. The function of MCAK in cells and its mechanism in vitro is currently being investigated by numerous labs.", "title": "Kinesin Transport Protein", "publishedDate": "2007-10-05T07:31:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "4TGSbXLtUR8", "description": "oinn :3 skype para contato : dudu.lv", "title": "Intro Zenutis v2  (By:Duds esse gostoso da porra)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T15:50:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "4TGixIAP92c", "description": "From a stinky and crude inception, the word fizzle's history is nothing to poo poo at.

Considering the world literature this condition is not very uncommon. Ophthalmic myiasis has been reported from different parts of the world in rural areas only amongst farmers,agriculturists and shepherds. It is still frequently misdiagnosed as allergic or viral conjunctivitis\nThis case is reported from urban region and ophthalmic surgeons need to be aware : \nPresenting a case of Ophthalmic Myiasis from Jabalpur.\nThe case was a school going boy of 14 yrs of age residing in good locality. While eating fast food he felt severe FB. Sensation in lt. eye and eye became red with lacrimation and reached my hospital within 30 minutes.\nThere was no history of allergy or conjunctivitis..\nOn slit lamp examination attempt was made to detect any foreign body as there was an evidence of unilateral inflammation.\nA fast moving multiple translucent foreign bodies identified in bulbar conjunctiva avoiding light..Diagnosis of Myiasis was made by direct visualization under higher magnification. There was no corneal or intraocular involvement.\nAfter instillation of local anaesthetic drops twenty eight paralysed larvae were removed by minimal suction force with rubber dropper\nTo prevent damage to the larva. Material was collected in normal saline. \nForeign body was mounted on microscope slide examined carefully and photographed under microscope. The larvae measured 2-4 mm In length showing active forward progressive movement under    microscope. \nThe larvae were identified as oestrus ovis. (sheep botfly) on the basis of their spindle shaped, the pair of sharply curved mouth hooks. The larvae were fast moving using mouth hooks for Invasion and fixing to the tissue. \nNo literature described and demonstrated live botfly larva movements under cover slip of microscope. \nTreatment consists of mechanically carefully removing of larva. Conjunctival sac washed with Betadine solution. Topical steroids and antibiotic drops. The patient was symptomless within few hours. \nRelieved of symptoms completely.\nThere must be proper communication\nbetween ophthalmologists and pathologists.", "title": "Dr. S. C.

Introducing the BR350 Evolution 8, brought to you by Buschur Racing and Medina Mitsubishi. Here is a sedan that can blast to 60 mph in less that 4 seconds.

This optional performance package will not only drop your 0-60 mph times from 4.7 seconds to 3.9 seconds it will also drop your \u00bc mile times from 13.4 at 104 mph to an amazing 12.6 seconds at 110 mph! You will also lose some weight, taking an additional 55 pounds from the cars already lightweight design. Impressed with the cars stock horsepower and torque levels?

You'll find this is more than enough to take yourself and 4 of your friends to dinner......very quickly. \n\nOverview\n\nWith the BR350 being the big brother to the BR330, of course means more modifications and more bang for your buck.

Even though I red lighted, this was the closest and most joyful run of the night. \n\nI started out by jumping the gun :( Even though I got the jump on the BR 350 he quickly regained that ground and more. Looking at the time slip, the EVO had me beat from the start by three tenths. I left the line 3 tenths before the EVO and he caught up to me by the 60 foot!!!! This was a great run and I only started making up ground on the top end but it was not enough. \n\nI hope that you enjoy this video and if the Owner of this car would like to come back out to VMP, I would love a friendly rematch without a red light on my behalf :) \n\nEnjoy!!!", "title": "Buschur Racing 350 EVO VS Eagle Talon TSI AWD", "publishedDate": "2013-03-04T15:07:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Tf8mZ5geEc", "description": "i have tried to translate it, but i don\u00b4t know if it can be understood :)\n\nlike i said I bought a copy of the Koran\nand I was really surprised  how clear that was written in it\nthe Koran does so: you do not take your fathers and brothers as \nfriends if they prefer the unbelief instead the belief\nand further\nFight those who believe not in God, until they pay tribute as a decreased\n...yes that is a clear statement....you can follow that\nyes because so many people say that is not the Koran that is not the Islam\n...hehe hehe mhh sure it is\nyes that stands there\nyes or.. moment ... moment..

Siamo noi la prova tangibile di un mondo in declino e di una comunit\u00e0 allo sbando? Siamo noi l'esempio calzante a cui contrapporre ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 bello, bravo e giusto?  Siamo noi i cattivi in questa sceneggiatura banale e scritta male? Se aiuta a sentirsi meglio, volentieri.\nDopo un lustro da turisti abbiamo deciso di tornare a casa, parcheggiare il furgone e scrivere una recensione sul nostro viaggio: le persone che abbiamo incontrato, i luoghi che abbiamo attraversato, quello di cui ci siamo nutriti e quello che dentro di noi \u00e8 cambiato. Questa \u00e8 quella che molti considerano l'Italia peggiore. Il paese dei giovani sfaccendati, degli eterni ragazzi a casa di mamma, dei pericolosi ribelli con mire terroristiche, degli artisti che impietosiscono perch\u00e9, anche loro, sono giovani disoccupati. Siamo noi l'Italia peggiore, \u00e8 una questione di punti di vista\".\n\n\"L'Italia peggiore\" segna il ritorno della band bolognese a poco pi\u00f9 di due anni dal fortunato \"Turisti della democrazia\", dopo un tour di 200 concerti e otto mesi lontani dai palchi. E' stato anticipato dal singolo \"C'eravamo tanto sbagliati\" e dal suo successo, capace di raggiungere il primo posto nella classifica italiana.\nL'album esce il 2 Giugno: una data di uscita scelta non a caso - quella del giorno in cui si celebra la Festa della Repubblica in Italia - ma proprio per il suo significato e le sue forti connotazioni patriottiche, a cui si contrappone, ironia pungente ma nient'affatto avulsa dalla realt\u00e0, il titolo del disco: \"L'Italia Peggiore\". Un titolo che \u00e8 un po' il filo conduttore dell'album, carico di umorismo critico e sferzante. Un'Italia bacchettata beffardamente per le sue contraddizioni, le sue ipocrisie piccole e grandi.\n\"L'Italia peggiore\" \u00e8 un disco lungo e vario: 14 brani che mostrano l'eclettismo dei cinque componenti della band e del collettivo Garrincha, che vi ha partecipato. C'\u00e8 pi\u00f9 rock che in passato (\"Senza macchine che vadano a fuoco\", \"La rivoluzione non passer\u00e0 in tv\", \"C'eravamo tanto sbagliati\", \"Piccoli incendiari non crescono\", \"Io, te e Carlo Marx\") ma c'\u00e8 anche tanta elettronica (\"Il sulografo e la principessa ballerina\", \"Linea 30\"), c'\u00e8 il reggae (\"La musica non \u00e8 una cosa seria\") e anche lo Ska (\"Forse pi\u00f9 tardi un mango adesso\"). C'\u00e8 tutto l'amore per il teatro canzone (\"Te per canzone una scritto ho\", \"In due \u00e8 amore in tre \u00e8 una festa\"), c'\u00e8 un divertissement registrato in presa diretta in un momento di cazzeggio (\"Amore Dozzinale\") e poi ci sono due pezzi che raccontano ed ironizzano sul nostro tempo (\"Questo \u00e8 un grande paese\", \"Instant classic\").\n\nIn questo secondo album, come sul palco accadeva gi\u00e0 da tempo, tutti e cinque i membri della band ci mettono la voce, caratterizzando fortemente ogni momento del disco: Bebo racconta \"Linea 30\", Checco canta e suona l'ukulele in \"La musica non \u00e8 una cosa seria\", Albi strilla in \"Forse pi\u00f9 tardi un mango adesso\" e Carota ci mostra il suo bellissimo timbro in \"Amore Dozzinale\". Come se non bastasse, altri tre illustri ospiti sono venuti a dar loro una mano: Piotta e Max Collini (Offlaga Disco Pax) in \"Questo \u00e8 un grande paese\" e Caterina Guzzanti in \"Instant Classic\". La produzione, come per i precedenti lavori, \u00e8 nelle mani di Matteo Costa Romagnoli, fondatore di Garrincha Dischi e Francesco Brini (Frank Agrario), titolare di Mozzarella Records e da anni collaboratore degli inglesi Swayzak.\n\n\"L'idea dell'artwork \u00e8 nata, come spesso accade tra di noi, un po' per caso, un po' mangiandoci la faccia e un po' di corsa. Il problema principale \u00e8 stata la scelta del titolo che ci ha portato via parecchio tempo. Dall'Italia peggiore, ai cappelli da asino, il passaggio \u00e8 stato veloce perch\u00e9 sono un bel simbolo, fanno ridere ma sono anche spiacevoli per chi le indossa. Siccome eravamo in pieno dibattito \"quote rosa\" ci siamo detti \"Troppa braga in questo disco!\" e cos\u00ec abbiamo pensato fosse bello affidare la cura grafica de L'Italia Peggiore ad un team di ragazze che portasse le nostra idea del catalogo da asini da un'altra parte. E cos\u00ec \u00e8 stato: sei artiste, sei ragazze di talento: Cristina Amodeo, Fada Full, Martina Galetti, Kerin, Cristina Span\u00f2, Elisabetta Percivati. Ed in ultima istanza Elia Della Casa che, come sempre, mette ordine, aggiusta, rifila e chiude il progetto di tutto quello che \u00e8 Lo Stato Sociale e Garrincha, con genialit\u00e0 e gusto.", "title": "Lo Stato Sociale con Caterina Guzzanti - Instant classic", "publishedDate": "2014-06-04T19:27:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ThJT-snhK4", "description": "BED COVERS \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nBed Covers - Buy Bed cover Sets Online in India | Jabong.com\n    www.jabong.com/home-living/home.../bed-linen/covers.../bed-covers/\n    Buy Designer Bed Covers Online in India.

Instead, you have decided to impose worsening austerity measures upon the people of the UK, increasing taxes for citizens and small businesses, making cuts to our National Health Service, education system, pensions and police force.\n\nYou have told the people that the only option out of the financial crisis is to make cuts and have made this humours joke of \"we are all in this together\", while simultaneously giving tax breaks to the wealthy corporations, enormous bonuses to the bankers who are responsible for the financial crisis in our country, and increasing your own wages. \n\nYou have created to system which ensures the poor remain poor, and the wealthy remain wealthy. You continue to infringe on the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people, attempting to gain access to our private and confidential information. It is now very clear to us that you have no intention of running the country for our people, but you will continue to run it to benefit yourselves. \n\nThis system has failed us. We now have homeless people dying on the streets this winter, people unable to support their families. People can no longer afford their education; you keep the elderly in work for much longer, keeping jobs and opportunities for younger people out of reach. The number of unemployed has skyrocketed. In response, you force those on benefits into unpaid labour, doing more hours unpaid than those who are properly employed. You add insult to injury, we say enough is enough.\n\nTo the UK government, you have made an enemy of Anonymous, you have angered us considerably and we pose a significant threat to you. You disregard the requests of the people and continue to operate for your own selfish gain. Anonymous is not a small group of powerless people to ignore, we are an organised , globally active, collective of like-minded individuals and our message is clear, we declare war on this current system you have imposed on us. Your worst enemy is now your own people.

Ruth publicly apologized to Dr. Curry for Ruth's errors.  \nhttp://rexcurry.net/daniel-ruth-tampa-tribune.html\n\nThe response against Ruth from the general public was so great that Ruth said he was labeled a \"Dork, anti-free market statist $#@%!&@, Dummkopf, liberal, daffy, dolt, stupid, dunce and, oh by the way, socialist.\" http://rexcurry.net/ruth.html\n\nRuth's use of \"socialist\" is very telling in that Ruth continues to cover-up for the National Socialist German Workers Party and its deadly dogma. Ruth writes flippantly about mass torture. Good Grief, Lyndon LaRouche was not as delusional as Ruth is. For many years, Ruth has flittered about the fringes of political life in the Tampa Bay area as a sort of scary class clown, although one suspects that Ruth's flatulence worsens every time Ruth tries rubbing his brain cells together. Both of them.\n\nRuth's insane clown posse act is like something out of \"Apocalypse Now\" meets \"A Clockwork Orange.\"\n\nRuth is still jealously mad about Dr. Curry's success in exposing Ruth and that explain's Ruth's pirouettes of linguistic blather. Recently, Ruth was educated by RexCurry.net about the Pledge of Allegiance. Ruth lost a lot of his naivete' and ignorance after viewing the web site. http://rexcurry.net/ruthmore.html\n\nIn a recent article about the web site Ruth did not dispute the work of the noted historian Dr. Rex Curry (author of \"Pledge of Allegiance Secrets\"). http://rexcurry.net/pledge-allegiance-pledge-allegiance.jpg\n\nPreviously, Ruth has proven his supreme economic ignorance. Recently, he has proven his historical ignorance and his legal ignorance.\n\nAs a career move, Daniel Ruth should not become a lawyer.  His \"journalism\" might cause some people to wonder if he is competent even to write about legal issues, or to write at all about anything. If Ruth is considering a career change to law then here is a Memo to Daniel Ruth: Don't start packing your bags.\n\nRuth's employer, the Tampa Tribune, is a so-called newspaper that has never published a historical photograph of the Pledge's early stiff-arm salute, nor printed an article about the Pledge's relationship to the salute of the National Socialist German Workers Party, its symbol and its rituals. Ruth has also never informed his readers about the new discoveries concerning the Pledge's past.  http://rexcurry.net/swastika3swastika.jpg\n\nIf there has ever been an article about Francis Bellamy (author of the Pledge of Allegiance) in Ruth's newspaper it repeated the usual shallow propaganda common to most \"news\" outlets. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html\n\nIn that way, the Tampa Tribune promotes and perpetuates flag fetishism by repeating the tired propaganda through touch-holes such as Ruth.  Now Ruth can no longer use the defense of unintentional ignorance, as he might have in the past.\n\nRuth remained unable or unwilling to state the simple issue: The Pledge of Allegiance was the origin of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers Party. Is Ruth dense or does lack of integrity and honesty make him unwilling to provide simple accurate reporting?\n\nRuth failed to discuss nor even enumerate the six or more issues that Curry's appellate brief argued on behalf of the defendant in the case. Ruth has the ability to let his audience decide for themselves because Ruth could post Curry's brief on the web site of the Tampa Tribune or TBO.com, but Ruth did not do so and will not do so because the brief would expose his inane comments, omissions and cover-ups.\n\nRuth learned to write in the government schools of Planet Zircon 9. Ruth's name is longer than his writing career highlights. It is no wonder that Ruth's columns never state any qualifications he has to write articles about the topic (or any articles). Only Ruth's phone number and email address were given with no biographical or background information (nor any link to such information).  There is a complete lack of disclosure of whether Ruth has any licensing or educational acheivement that qualifies him to write on such a topic, how she was selected, nor how much Ruth was paid to write the piece.\nRuth's remarks are a reminder of the cliche' \"If you can't do, and you can't teach, then write.\"\n\nRuth knows that the media debate challenge that was issued by Dr. Rex Curry as quoted by another Tribune reporter, is also available to Ruth and Ruth knows that everyone else knows that Ruth has always been too much of a cowardly to do it over the many years he and never will.\nIt will always remain another media debate challenge victory for Dr. Curry over Daniel Ruth and the Tampa Tribune.", "title": "Daniel Ruth Tampa Tribune Flag Fetishism Nazis LaRouche", "publishedDate": "2008-09-11T15:03:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "4TtsDEp4GkA", "description": "Download Links: http://playon101.blogspot.com/2013/11/Timelines-Assault-On-America-Free-PC-Direct-Download-Links-full-game-Torrent-crack.html\n\nTimelines Assault On America Free Download The occupation is mature by 4Flash Mutual and published by Strategy Premiere and its basic monumental insolvency is linked to the plot around which the run is stacked.\n\nIn the summer of 1942, the OSS, the freshman embodiment of commandoes in the Consolidated States, manages to assassinate Hitler and the gritty explains how this leads to a non-aggression accord with the Country Organized and then a cooperative Nazi and Noble Asiatic intrusion of the mainland of the Tied States.\n\nI bed secondary fiction, something easily verified by the fact that I individual played likely around 100 hours of Hearts of Metal III, but Timelines Assault On America Free Download has a substandard postulate and fails to get it in an fascinating style.\n\nIn 1942, Frg had already been fighting Country for most a sonorous assemblage and so untold carnage took expanse that the Pol program would have never signed a isolable peace low any conditions Timelines Assault On America Free Download.\n\nThe Germans did not human the ships or planes to attack Great Britain, which is honourable a stone's verbalize away from mainland Europe Timelines Assault On America Free Download.\n\nSurvey somebody Review soul Action term Liquidator output Timelines Assault On America Free Download\n\nIt was unrealistic for them to begin an invasion of the Allied States for at lowest 10 period, such little control the Atlantic and use Land as a mustering area.\n\nAll the lie elements could be ignored as desire as Timelines Assault On America Free Download: Thoroughbred on Ground delivered worthy gameplay and gripping strategic choices, but in a concern that has seen the start of Associate of Heroes and Sharp Excise, the gamy offers cypher new or fascinating.\n\nSupposal construction is clunky and insensitive and it's harder than it should be to set a simple recuperate inform.\n\nOrganisation laxation is supernatural but noneffervescent allows foot and tanks to suggest at roughly the aforesaid quantify across the map Timelines Assault On America Free Download.\n\nThere's no dedication to practicality and virtually all matches move around concentrating the biggest limit of tanks in the duplicate region at the very experience and defeating the resister piecemeal Timelines Assault On America Free Download.\n\n\nTimelines  Assault On America Free Download\nAssault On America Free Download\nTimelines  Assault On America\nAssault On America", "title": "Timelines Assault On America Free Download [PC]", "publishedDate": "2013-12-04T13:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Tu3iUx1NZ4", "description": "Benedict Cumberbatch plays Julian Assange; the man behind WikiLeaks....and the controversial \"whistle blowing\" as a result of the website.

The shaping process involves \"reinforcement of successive approximations of the desired response.\" Following initial exposure to the box, the rat is given pellets of food for approaching the lever, then sniffing the lever, touching the lever, and finally pressing the lever. (A green circle indicates food presentation.) Although the rat's behaviors remain variable throughout the process, the delivery of reinforcement following specific behaviors increases the future likelihood of those, and similar, behaviors.

Patients are admitted who have a traumatic injury, debilitating disease or following certain types of surgery. Acute Rehabilitation is appropriate for patients who will benefit from an intensive, multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. Patients receive physical, occupational and speech therapy as needed and are medically managed by specially trained physicians. There is an attending physician onsite 24 hours a day to manage the medical aspects of each patient's care.\n\nFor patients with neurological diagnoses, a neuropsychologist is on staff to determine if they are in need of additional psychological or psychiatric treatment. In an acute rehabilitation hospital, the patient is expected to make significant functional gains and medical improvement within a reasonable time frame. Patients receive a minimum of three hours of therapy per day, up to six days a week.  Therapy is provided on both a one to one and group basis, depending on the needs of the individual patient. Additional services such as respiratory therapy and therapeutic recreation programs are also available for patients during their rehabilitation.\n\nAcute vs Sub Acute - What's the Difference?\nSub acute level care is less intensive than acute rehabilitation. Although a combination of physical, occupational and speech therapy may be provided in the sub acute setting, the number of hours each patient receives is lower. Generally, patients in a sub acute facility only receive between one and two hours of therapy per day. The average length of stay at a sub acute facility is also generally longer than at an acute hospital. For patients who are not appropriate candidates for acute rehabilitation, Burke offers a network of affiliated sub acute facilities that offer Burke trained physical, occupational and speech therapists", "title": "What is Acute Rehabilitation?", "publishedDate": "2013-03-01T15:17:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "4U0EKFMjHTY", "description": "German version: Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Honolulu Strandbikini - Club Honolulu (Original: Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini)", "title": "\u266a\u266b Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Honolulu Strandbikini - Club Honolulu (German version) \u266b\u266a", "publishedDate": "2012-03-24T13:00:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "4U0WWTLX68A", "description": "DOWNLOAD LINK:\n\nFor ORIGINAL INSTRUMENTALS or to UPLOAD BEATS signup: http://www.hipstrumentals.net\n\nIndustry Instrumentals: http://www.hipstrumentals.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/hipstrumentals\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/hipstrumentals\nOriginalsYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/hipstrumentalsorig\n\nL'A Capone Ft.

This is the most advanced life saving method available today, and is used when every other life support measure fails to support patients whose heart and lungs are so severely diseased or damaged that they can no longer function. It is similar to heart-lung bypass technology, used for longer periods of time in Intensive Care Units, till the patient recovers.\n\nECMO is used only when medicines and ventilator treatment are not able to keep a patient alive, and there are strict criteria to determine which patients will benefit from this technology. The procedure involves using a specialized machine called ECMO pump. Blood from the patient is run through special pipes for the purpose of achieving gas exchange through a membrane Oxygenator. The purified blood is sent back to the body through the tubes. This happens until the heart and/or lungs are able to work on their own. The amount of time this takes depends on how the heart and lungs heal. \n\n\u0c05\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c35\u0c38\u0c30 \u0c38\u0c02\u0c26\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c2d\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c4b

These handsome digger wasps provide exclusively Honey Bees Apis mellifera as live food for their larvae. The bees are usually ambushed whilst feeding on flowers (often those of Hedera species), stung to induce paralysis and they are then slung upside-down underneath the wasps and held by the middle pair of legs. The helpless bees are then flown back to the nest hole where they will be clasped by the wasp's secateur-like jaws and hauled down backwards.  The wasps' front legs are well adapted for digging loose sand. The holes themselves are quite deep excavations and the larvae are therefore very well protected.  Although the holes are often covered over when the females are not in attendance the wasps are able to relocate them without difficulty. It was observed that the wasps will not attempt to take bees paralysed by other wasps if they have been discarded. In between these activities the wasps are often observed feeding on flowers including those of  Creeping Thistles Cirsium arvense as illustrated here.", "title": "Bee Wolves Philanthus triangulum feeding on Creeping Thistle Cirsium arvense", "publishedDate": "2013-04-01T00:04:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "4U5M4L0l8t8", "description": "", "title": "Black-legged Kittiwake", "publishedDate": "2013-02-06T21:57:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "4U5P3o4dwME", "description": "", "title": "The Stone Foxes - Locomotion (Live at The Complex SF)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-26T09:29:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "4U5Wc7Jl8pk", "description": "Aziz ber\u00e4ttar vad han jobbar med", "title": "Farsan - Maffia Scen", "publishedDate": "2010-07-04T13:41:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "4U5kKnQxc3E", "description": "If you think going green is too expensive, you're burying your head in the sand.

March 4] 1877, at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow as The Lake of the Swans.\nAlthough it is presented in many different versions, most ballet companies base their stagings both choreographically and musically on the 1895 revival of Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, first staged for the Imperial Ballet on January 15, 1895, at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia. For this revival, Tchaikovsky's score was revised by the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatre's chief conductor and composer Riccardo Drigo.\n\nComposition process\n\nTchaikovsky's excitement with Swan Lake is evident based on the quick speed with which he composed.\nCommissioned in the spring of 1875, the piece was created within one full year, however from Tchaikovsky's letters to Sergei Taneyev from August 1875, it was not only his excitement which compelled Tchaikovsky to create it so rapidly, but his wish to finish it as soon as possible, so as to allow him to start on an opera. Respectively, he created scores of the first three numbers of the ballet, then the orchestration in the fall and winter, and was still struggling with the instrumentation in the spring.\nBy April 1876, the work was fully completed. Judging upon Tchaikovsky's mention of a draft, the presence of some sort of abstract would be plausible. However, no such draft has ever been seen.\nTchaikovsky wrote various letters to friends expressing his longstanding desire to work with this type of music, and his excitement concerning his current stimulating, albeit laborious task.\n\nInstrumentation\n\nSwan Lake is scored for the typical late 19th-century large orchestra:\n\nStrings: violins I and II; violas, violoncellos; double basses\nWoodwinds: piccolo; 2 flutes; 2 oboes; 2 clarinets in B\u266d, A and C; 2 bassoons\nBrass: 4 horns in F; 2 cornets in A and B\u266d; 2 trumpets in F, D, and E; 3 trombones (2 tenor, 1 bass); tuba\nPercussion: timpani; snare drum; cymbals; bass drum; triangle; tambourine; castanets; tam-tam; glockenspiel\nOther: harp\n\nOther versions/uses\n\nThe 1990 LucasArts adventure game Loom used a major portion of the Swan Lake suite for its audio track, as well as incorporating a major swan theme into the storyline. It otherwise bore no resemblance to the original ballet.\n\nIn Radio City Christmas Spectacular, The Rockettes do a short homage to Swan Lake during the performance of the Twelve Days of Christmas (Rock and Dance Version), with the line \"Seven Swans A-Swimming.\"\n\nBilly Elliot the Musical incorporates the most famous section of Swan Lake in a dance number, in which the main character dances while shadowed by his future, adult self.\n\nTelevision\n\nThe 2002 anime Princess Tutu (2002) frequently alludes to Swan Lake.\nIn the second season of the anime Kaleido Star, a circus adaptation of Swan Lake becomes one of the Kaleido Stage's most important and successful shows.\nIn the Japanese tokusatsu show Kamen Rider Den-O, the main protagonist has the ability to take different forms, based on the \"imagin\" that possess him. One of the imagin, known as Sieg, is analogous to the legend of Swan Lake.\nIn Episode 213 of The Muppet Show, Rudolf Nureyev performs \"Swine Lake\" with a giant ballerina pig.\nSwan Lake was heard in two episodes of the Playhouse Disney series Little Einsteins.\n\nSelected Discography\n\n1954, Antal Dor\u00e1ti (conductor), Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (first complete recording, available only in mono)\n1975 (approx.), Andre Previn (conductor), London Symphony Orchestra\n1982, John Lanchbery (conductor), Philharmonia Orchestra\n1988, Yevgeny Svetlanov (conductor), Russian State Symphony Orchestra\n1990, Michael Tilson Thomas (conductor), London Symphony Orchestra\n1992, Charles Dutoit (conductor), Montreal Symphony Orchestra\n2006, Valery Gergiev (conductor), Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre", "title": "The Cats - Swan Lake (Pyotr Tchaikovsky)", "publishedDate": "2012-05-06T22:18:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "4UFrRwg7Bgo", "description": "Smith & Wesson Model 642 Airweight Subcompact Revolver .38 Caliber - The Lighthouse Lady\n\nSmith & Wesson 38 SPL is my carry gun.

He graduated from Newark's Weequahic High School in or around 1950.[7] \"It has provided the focus for the fiction of Philip Roth, the novelist who evokes his era at Weequahic High School in the highly acclaimed Portnoy's Complaint.... Besides identifying Weequahic High School by name, the novel specifies such sites as the Empire Burlesque, the Weequahic Diner, the Newark Museum and Irvington Park, all local landmarks that helped shape the youth of the real Roth and the fictional Portnoy, both graduates of Weequahic class of '50.\" The Weequahic Yearbook (1950) describes Roth as \"A boy of real intelligence, combined with wit and common sense.\" Roth was known as a comedian during his time at school.[8] Roth attended Bucknell University, earning a degree in English. He pursued graduate studies at the University of Chicago, where he received an M.A. in English literature in 1955 and worked briefly as an instructor in the university's writing program. Roth taught creative writing at the University of Iowa and Princeton University. He continued his academic career at the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught comparative literature before retiring from teaching in 1991.\n\nWhile at Chicago, Roth met the novelist Saul Bellow, as well as Margaret Martinson in 1956, who became his first wife in 1959. Their separation in 1963, along with Martinson's death in a car crash in 1968, left a lasting mark on Roth's literary output. Specifically, Martinson was the inspiration for female characters in several of Roth's novels, including Lucy Nelson in When She Was Good, and Maureen Tarnopol in My Life As a Man.[9] Between the end of his studies and the publication of his first book in 1959, Roth served two years in the United States Army and then wrote short fiction and criticism for various magazines, including movie reviews for The New Republic. Events in Roth's personal life have occasionally been the subject of media scrutiny. A post-operative breakdown mentioned in the pseudo-confessional novel Operation Shylock (1993) and others[10][11][12] drew on Roth's experience of the temporary side-effects of the sedative halcion (triazolam), prescribed post-operatively in the 1980s.[13][14] (It was subsequently discovered that unfavorable studies had been suppressed by triazolam's manufacturer, Upjohn, which showed the drug carried a high risk of causing short term psychiatric disturbance.[15] When this became known, the drug was banned in some countries[16] and its withdrawal due to high risk and poor clinical benefit was also discussed in the United States.[17][18])\n\nIn 1990, Roth married his long-time companion, English actress Claire Bloom. In 1994 they separated, and in 1996 Bloom published a memoir, Leaving a Doll's House, which described the couple's marriage in detail, much of which was unflattering to Roth. Certain aspects of I Married a Communist have been regarded by critics as veiled rebuttals to accusations put forth in Bloom's memoir.", "title": "Unboxing Nemesis by Philip Roth", "publishedDate": "2014-04-01T00:03:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "4UNqhM1xBk0", "description": "", "title": "AP Latin Video 6B Ablative Case Cont", "publishedDate": "2012-07-04T20:50:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "4UOHbiV6CC8", "description": "In the Summer of 2014, Royer Corp. held the \"Show Us Your Swizzle\" video contest as part of Ohana, Luau at the Lake in lake George, NY All of the awesome entries can be seen at this link:\n\nhttp://blog.royercorp.com/swizzle-stick-creativity-at-its-best-ohana/royer-video-contest-2014\n\nAs LUCK would have it, WE WON!!!

Prior wingspan estimates for pelagornithids went up to 6 metres, but they were based on more fragmented fossils.\n\n\"Most likely, evolution of such large sizes was to avoid competition with other birds,\" says lead author Gerald Mayr, a palaeornithologist at the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum in Germany. \"Birds with such a large size can, of course, sail across huge distances and may more easily find prey in the open ocean.\"\n\nBut, \"there are a number of drawbacks if you become so large,\" he adds. Chicks would have to be raised over a long period of time, making them more prone to predation.\n\n\"Moreover,\" Mayr says, \"bird feathers are quite heavy, so very large birds may have become too heavy.\"\n\nMayr and palaeontologist David Rubilar of Chile's National Museum of Natural History analysed the big bird's fossilised remains, which are 70% complete. The bird is described in the latest issue of the  Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology .\n\nRuled the skies\n\nThis new species was a seabird from northern Chile, but fossils of other bony-toothed birds have been found on other continents. It's likely that all of these species were huge.\n\nThe researchers think the birds soared the skies looking for food, such as fish and squid. Once prey was spotted, the birds would cruise across the surface with their lower jaws immersed in the water, grabbing the slippery prey securely with their beaks.\n\nBony-toothed birds were a very successful group, living during most of the Cenozoic period over a time span of 50 to 60 million years. They all became extinct approximately 2 million years ago at a time when the Panamanian isthmus between North and South America closed.\n\nOur distant human ancestors may have even watched these boat-sized birds in action. Fossils suggest pelagornithids lived in North Africa during the Pliocene Era.\n\n\"If early humans, such as australopithecines or Homo erectus, lived in Morocco by that time and went to the sea, they would have seen these birds,\" says Mayr.\n\nMayr thinks it's possible predation by mammals coming over from North America could have wiped out the birds at their breeding grounds, or perhaps they couldn't tolerate resulting changes in sea currents.\n\nCecile Mourer-Chauvire, a paleornithologist at Claude Bernard University, says she wasn't surprised by the study, since it's been theorised for a while that pelagornithids \"were really gigantic flying birds.\"\n\nStig Walsh, Senior Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology at National Museums Scotland, also thinks it's \"entirely possible the Chilean Pelagornis could have had a wingspan of 17 feet [5 metres].\"\n\nWalsh explained that the bird's bones had extremely thin walls, like those of pterosaur bones. \"The lightness this must have given their bodies probably contributed to their ability to grow to such a large size,\" says Walsh.\"", "title": "Flying BIrds", "publishedDate": "2012-04-06T17:44:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "4UQYIGt2iuw", "description": "There's only one thing Prince Wu is looking forward to more than ruling the Earth Kingdom, his PARTY!

A late-term abortion using Caesarean section procedures is termed a hysterotomy abortion and is very rarely performed. The first modern Caesarean section was performed by German gynecologist Ferdinand Adolf Kehrer in 1881.\n\nA Caesarean section is usually performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby's or mother's life or health at risk, although in recent times it has also been performed upon request for childbirths that could otherwise have been natural. In recent years the rate has risen to a record level of 46% in China and to levels of 25% and above in many Asian, European and Latin American countries. In 2007, in the United States, the Caesarean section rate was 31.8%. Across Europe, there are significant differences between countries: in Italy the Caesarean section rate is 40%, while in the Nordic countries it is only 14%. Medical professional policy makers find that elective cesarean can be harmful to the fetus and neonate without benefit to the mother, and have established strict guidelines for non-medically indicated cesarean before 39 weeks.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Posner, Michael Roban, Steven Shainberg\nScreenwriter: Erin Cressida Wilson, Mary Gaitskill, Steven Shainberg\nFilm Description: Sadomasochism provides the backdrop for a very unusual employer/employee relationship in this very offbeat romantic drama from filmmaker Steven Shainberg. Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a shy young woman, who, after a brief spell in a mental institution, is released in the care of her overprotective mother (Lesley Ann Warren) and hard-drinking father (Stephen McHattie). Hoping to make good on her own, Lee begins looking for a job, and in her free time indulges in her odd habit of inflicting pain upon herself in various ways. Lee is hired as a secretary by E. Edward Grey (James Spader), a grim and ruthlessly efficient attorney who warns her that her work will be both dull and demanding. Lee takes to the job with genuine enthusiasm, and while she's recently acquired a new boyfriend, Peter (Jeremy Davies), she's far more intrigued by Grey's coldly patrician demeanor. While Grey often criticizes Lee, she seems to thrive on his abuse, but one day he crosses a line when he insists upon spanking her after some minor mistake. Lee quite enjoys the treatment, and wants it to continue, but Grey can no longer take pleasure humiliating Lee when he knows that she likes it; he fires her, despite her pleas to be allowed to stay. Finally discovering the key to her sexual and emotional needs, Lee tries to persuade Peter to be rough with her, but he simply doesn't have the taste or talent for it, and Lee soon maps out a last-ditch effort to win back her position with Grey, whatever the cost. Secretary won a special award for \"Originality\" at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nsecretary,\"secretary clip\",\"secretary's office\",\"secretary bird\",\"james spader\",\"jeremy davies\",\"maggie gyllenhaal\",\"lesley ann warren\",\"stephen mchattie\",\"jacket videos\",\"kleenex videos\",\"mirror videos\",\"ring videos\",\"wedding gown videos\",\"independent comedies\",\"independent dramas\",\"indie romance\",\"dark humor black comedies\",drama,\"steamy romance\",\"michael roban\",\"amy hobby\",\"andrew fierberg\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++261189,/m/043js,/m/023mdt,/m/078mgh,/m/04bdqk,/m/0fs9jn", "title": "Secretary (8/9) Movie CLIP - I Love You (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-25T19:51:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "4UfwilPzTJ0", "description": "Duminic\u0103, 16 noiembrie, \u00een ziua votului din turul doi al Alegerilor Preziden\u021biale, o echip\u0103 Rom\u00e2nia TV a \u00eencercat s\u0103 ne prezinte o realitate paralel\u0103, la una dintre sec\u021biile de votare de la Paris.

They would vomit in order to keep eating\nEmperor Caligula's horse lived in a marble stable with an ivory manger.\nHe also tried to make his horse the Consul, which is the highest elected office in the Roman Republic\nPeople socialized at communal toilets. Rome had about 150 of them.\nRomans used urine to clean their clothes because it contains ammonia\nRoman physicians recommended gladiator blood in order to aid fertility\nEarly Rome had very few women so they would kidnap them from neighboring tribes\nThe word \"decimate\" derives from the Roman practice of killing every tenth soldier if they tried to mutiny\nOn the opening day of the Colosseum 5,000 animals were killed\nSince then it is estimated that over half a million people and one million animals died there\nRomans were petrified of anything to do with the \"left\" (including being left handed). In fact, our word \"sinister\" derives from the ancient Roman word for \"left\"\nAfter birth a baby was placed at his father's feet. If the father took the child into his arms it showed that he accepted responsibility. If not, it would be left for dead.\nWhen children couldn't fall asleep mothers would put goat dung in their diapers\nTo clean themselves, Romans covered themselves with oil and then scraped it off with a special tool\nThey ate stuffed flamingos\nGirls were expected to marry by age 13 or 14\nWhen Roman soldiers were first ordered to invade Britain in 43 AD they refused because it was \"beyond the known world and there could be monsters\".\nAfter Cicero was murdered for criticizing Rome, Fulvia, the wife of another politician, apparently pulled his tongue out and stabbed it repeatedly with her hairpin\nTo make sure that gladiators weren't faking their deaths, the bodies would be bashed with mallets after the competition.\nTo escape a forced marriage, Emperor Valentinian II's sister sent Attila the Hun her engagement ring as a plea for help. He interpreted it as a marriage proposal and demanded Rome as dowry.\nRomans actually recorded several UFO sightings\nHaving murdered both his wife and his mother, Nero's last words were \"What an artist I die!\"\nRomans used powdered mouse brains as toothpaste\nJulius Caeser hated going bald so he made it illegal for anyone to stand above him and look down on his bald patch. The consequence for doing so was death.\nThere were people in Rome who earned their living by plucking other people's armpits", "title": "25 Reasons The Ancient Romans Were Out Of Their Minds", "publishedDate": "2014-06-26T15:28:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Uga9aVIWFc", "description": "Skyfox and I had a little pun war.

Symbols depicted in these pictures can be found in proto-Celtic, Egyptian ideograms, Mlecchan and Droopa symbolic writing. These signs, belong to an ancient Alien language, that was here long before modern cultures erased them after the destruction of the tower of Babel and the reduction of languages and alphabets to something about 20 to 50 symbols. Pictograms of this kind can be found in stone age caves, and sacred scriptures of such complexity, that are non alphabetic, can be written upwards, downwards, from left to right, from right to left, in circular mode, jumping mode, and have various meanings at the same time, in consideration of particular aspects that we are coding in writing. Seganography and cryptology scientist know about these languages but are not allowed to say. Anyhow, University courses and teachers will laugh at you if you and give you a no comment answer if you happen to investigate this subject. This is not called ignorance, but nescience, and knowledge of this kind, kept apart for military purposes, they say, could be useful just in case we want to communicate something to someone without fear that someone else understands what we are saying. Dark Powers love these tricky games, but can't understand or even read such languages. I know that one of the most complex of these languages is composd of 600.000 symbols of this kind. Fortunately, only to write them all down it would take a man something like 40 years, and so there is no point in hyding such a language to mankind, unless we fear our Word, which we say ir comes directly form God, is not exactly holy language, but an over simplyfied system in vogue since ice age. Jedi Masters know, can read this language, write and possess direct perception of this holy language because they use uncommon, sense, sensing truth before accepting definitions made to paralize mind and thought itself limiting reality. ... more on www.jedisimon.com if you are interested in the topic... take care", "title": "Alien Symbols by Jedi Simon", "publishedDate": "2010-11-13T16:16:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "4UiZSiArBQw", "description": "Lily Allen describes what it's like from selling out concerts to now being an opening act for Miley Cyrus.\n\nSubscribe to The Jonathan Ross Show YouTube channel for weekly videos and the best bits from the show - http://www.youtube.com/TheJonathanRossShow\n\nFollow the show on Twitter: https://twitter.com/JRossShow\nLike the show on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheJonathanRossShow", "title": "Lily Allen Performing With Miley Cyrus - The Jonathan Ross Show", "publishedDate": "2014-11-08T22:30:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "4UirQjU3kgk", "description": "", "title": "How to Burn Wise with an EPA Non-Catalytic Stove", "publishedDate": "2009-09-02T12:57:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Uj1deBbEYQ", "description": "Kids actin goofy", "title": "Kids actin goofy", "publishedDate": "2013-07-31T13:14:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "4UjAbrD7MqE", "description": "Watch the full Worlds Apart: http://youtu.be/Fl9ybM1ITe8\nThe Ebola outbreak has ravaged communities, destroyed lives and alienated victims from their loved ones.

G.Monfils 6-4, 6-1, 4-6, 1-6, 6-0 Andy Murray celebrates during his 6-4, 6-1, 4-6, 1-6, 6-0 win against Ga\u00ebl Monfils in the French Open quarter-finals. Photograph: Tony O'Brien/Action Images\nAndy Murray, forced to finish a fight in the dark he should have ended with a knockout in the sunlight, drew on all his obduracy to bagel a rampant Ga\u00ebl Monfils in 21 minutes in the quarter-finals of the French Open and seal one of the most improbable victories of his career.\n\nBeating Monfils 6-4, 6-1, 4-6, 1-6, 6-0 (a scoreline as perverse as the winner) earned him a semi-final against the defending French Open champion, Rafael Nadal, and now all things are possible in the craziest of all possible worlds.\n\nIt took Murray three hours and 12 minutes to knock out Monfils but he could have and should have done the job more quickly than the two hours and 34 minutes it took Nadal to beat David Ferrer 4-6, 6-4, 6-0, 6-1 in the other quarter-final on Court Suzanne Lenglen.\n\nFerrer, one of the game's renowned fighters, later explained to the media how he lost 13 of the last 14 games. \"It wasn't that good as a match,\" he said, \"given the players that we are. The court was slow. He started playing a lot better, making fewer mistakes, and I threw in the towel. I don't usually do this, but I thought, I'm not going to be able to come back. Not against Rafa. He's such good a player.\"\n\nIf Murray ever allowed himself such a negative thought, he would probably quit the sport. He laced his own courtside assessment with a good deal of irony when he observed of the man who has won eight titles on Court Philippe Chatrier, \"Nadal had good memories on this court. I'll need to recover well but I'm happy to be in the semi-finals.\"\n\nMurray brings a unique ingredient to what will be their 20th encounter, one fashioned from doggedness. In finding the grit to play a fifth set in deteriorating light, Murray was energised. He showed them all: the crowd, who like and admire him but wanted his blood, and his friend on the other side of the net. When a demoralised Monfils drove his final forehand into the net, Murray had pulled off an extraordinary comeback -- and he was as sorry for the loser as everyone in France.\n\n\"We've known each other since we were 10, 11 years old,\" he said of Monfils. \"I'm very good friends with him, so it's tough.\"\n\nAlthough he appeared to be pleading with the tournament supervisor Stefan Franzen to let them go to the locker room at two sets apiece, he explained later he was asking how long they might have to play -- and he wondered why Franzen was talking only to him, giving the impression to the crowd that it was Murray, and not Monfils, who wanted to stop playing. \"I didn't want to stop the match,\" Murray said. \"I just wanted clarification.\"", "title": "Andy Murray - Ga\u00ebl Monfils highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-06-05T08:56:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Ul3LzLTXuw", "description": "Denne videoen handler om Superspeed julecruise 2013", "title": "coolztv doing skagerrak", "publishedDate": "2013-12-01T21:34:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "4UlJ69byR3w", "description": "BUY! http://itunes.apple.com/album/aston-ii/id521907550 \n\nAus iTunes link: http://itunes.apple.com/au/album/aston/id398442669\n\nA Classical version of Rihanna's Rude Boy.

To get into the next batch of dung, it needs to get its spores away from the poop and onto grass where a hungry herbivore might accidentally eat it. So it cleverly shoots its black cap full of spores many centimeters away. The stalks are phototropic and aim towards the sun to maximize the distance the spores travel from their dung pile. This is a 21 hour time lapse movie of Pilobolus crystallinus, also known as the \"dung cannon\" or \"hat thrower.\" Images were taken at 1 minute intervals. The medium is a \"poo-cube\" solidified with agar, then seeded with spores. \n\nHere you can see external droplets developing and resorbing on the stalks, the production of yellow carotenoid pigments involved in light sensing, and the growth and discharge of the fungus's ballistic mechanism.\n\nRead about an animal that exploits the rocket-like power of Pilobolus at the Cornell Mushroom Blog:   http://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2006/12/14/pilobolus-and-the-lungworm/", "title": "Pilobolus crystallinus 3", "publishedDate": "2012-07-27T17:43:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Up9eHUEgwQ", "description": "Welcome to Algonquin Middle School! \nWe're going to help you learn how to use your locker and keep it clean!", "title": "Algonquin Middle School Lockers", "publishedDate": "2013-03-19T15:01:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Up_t8rMYzg", "description": "The first video made in my experimental aircraft series and my most recent replica.

Both have a 7\" screen and both feature Pioneer's impressive AppRadio system/software. \n\nBoth of these models cost $500 and both of these models use SSP \"Secure Simple\" pairing. It's the coolest thing for Bluetooth use that I've sen. There's no code to use\u2014it's just a prompt asking you if you want the head unit to use the app. What these models do is use the AppRadio app for both Apple and Android. So you have a system that uses the same Android or iOS apps\u2014there just optimized for the widescreen display of the in-dash receiver and they also take into account safety features. You don't want a lot of little tiny little buttons and you dont' want to have to stare at the screen. These apps are made so that you can really just keep your eyes on the road and not get distracted by using the basic features of the radio. You can really just wing a hand out and access a track or turn up the volume without really thinking about it.\n\nBottom line: I love that I can take the experience that I have with my iPhone or my Android device...and put it in my car. I mean, I can't run every app\u2014but the number of apps already out there is astounding. \n\nFor the full written review, please visit:\nhttp://www.audioholics.com/gadget-reviews/pioneer-avh-x7500bt-and-sph-da210-appradio-review/", "title": "Pioneer AVH-X7500BT and SPH-DA210 AppRadio 3 In-Dash Car Stereo Review", "publishedDate": "2014-02-16T13:17:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "4V43zF90U8s", "description": "About enslaved people who mine tantalum, a precious metal found in the DRC", "title": "Enslaved Tantalum Miners", "publishedDate": "2011-10-30T15:41:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "4V4OiW8tcps", "description": "Leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters Julius Malema along with Floyd Shivambu were thrown out of Parliament on Wednesday 17 September 2014.\n\nThe EFF MPs, during a question session with the deputy president, accused Cyril Ramaphosa of having the blood of slain Marikana mine workers on his hands.", "title": "Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu call Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa a Murderer", "publishedDate": "2014-09-17T20:40:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "4V4Qv5RvtDk", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Koleksi-Tree-Indah-Amy/143092915790126\nhttp://treeindahamy.blogspot.com/", "title": "Izinkan Aku Mencintaimu - Republik ~ Lirik~", "publishedDate": "2013-11-10T03:29:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "4V4bIzP1bY8", "description": "Glenn Greenwald slammed the lapdog Obama media today on FOX News.\n\"I think you see it in the coverage of the Obama administraion where all the time newspapers and media outlets just uncritically repeat what the government says without any investigation.

The pore is bordered by a pair of specialized parenchyma cells known as guard cells that are responsible for regulating the size of the opening. The term is also used collectively to refer to an entire stomatal complex, both the pore itself and its accompanying guard cells. Air containing carbon dioxide and oxygen enters the plant through these openings and is used in photosynthesis in the mesophyll cells (parenchyma cells with chloroplasts) and respiration, respectively. Oxygen produced as a by-product of photosynthesis diffuses out to the atmosphere through these same openings. Also, water vapor is released into the atmosphere through these pores in a process called transpiration.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC-BY-3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma\n\nText to Speech powered by voice-rss.com\n\nImages are Public Domain or CC-BY-3.0:\nTracheal_stoma.jpg from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tracheal_stoma.jpg\n\nTomato_stoma_observed_through_immersion_oil.gif from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma\n\n300px-HPIM0188-ligusterblad.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma\n\nClonorchis_anterior_showing_Stoma_and_oral_sucker.jpg from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Clonorchis_anterior_showing_Stoma_and_oral_sucker.jpg", "title": "All About - Stoma", "publishedDate": "2014-11-01T19:40:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "4V6uvtc-3wk", "description": "", "title": "Keefah and his c4", "publishedDate": "2014-05-14T09:57:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "4V6wRsrzxS0", "description": "Stupid Girl rents harley, hole shot and drops it...

This increases if you move to stainless steel pipes or if you move to big diameters of tubing. However, regardless of the shape of the tube or pipe, a variety of factors such as wall thickness, size, tooling and lubricants influence the bending process. Very important is at the design process to take in considerations the complicated factors that take place in order to make clamping and wiper dies effective. All parts of a bending die need to be accurate, whereas wipers need to have the sliding effect, that is why we are using bronze-aluminium material (CUPRAL 2), or heat treated and nitrating steel tools. Heat treatment ensures the hardness of the piece at the point the designer requires, and nitrating ensures an extra hardness on the surface. This gives the flexibility to leave the core of the material less hard and at the same time less brittle.", "title": "Stelco Romania - CNC Bending - Metalworking and Steel Fabrication", "publishedDate": "2011-06-29T09:54:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "4VInSCDVnP0", "description": "Annoying Orange swaps places with Pac-Man in celebration of Pac-Man's 30th anniversary!\n\nFREE version of my video game Kitchen Carnage is out!!!\niTunes: http://bit.ly/KitchenCarnageFREE\nAndroid: http://bit.ly/KCLiteGoogle\n\nMERCH:\nAO TOYS! http://bit.ly/AOToys\nT-SHIRTS:   http://bit.ly/AOMerch\niPHONE  iPOD GAME: http://bit.ly/KitchenCarnage\niPAD GAME: http://bit.ly/KitchenCarnageHD\nANDROID GAME: http://bit.ly/qqDmRi\n\nFOLLOW ME:\nTWITTER: http://twitter.com/annoyingorange\nFACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/annoyingorange\nGOOGLE+: http://bit.ly/AOGooglePYouTube\n\nMY WEBSITE: http://annoyingorange.com\n\nWATCH ALL MY EPISODES: http://bit.ly/AOPlaylist\n\nCREATED BY: \nDANEBOE: http://youtube.com/daneboe\nDANEBOE GAMING CHANNEL: http://youtube.com/superboebros\nDANEBOE 2ND CHANNEL: http://youtube.com/user/gagfilms", "title": "Annoying Orange - Pacmania", "publishedDate": "2010-05-14T15:22:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "4VIvE39vTPQ", "description": "Atlanta Falcons beat New York Giants @ Georgia Dome. \nCopyrights Fox Sports \n\nFirst Quarter\n02:48 Turner M.

It may refer to only the mansion (the 340-room main building) that has the President's official residence and offices; it may also refer to the entire 130 hectare (320 acre) President Estate that includes huge gardens (Mughal Gardens), residences of bodyguards and staff, other offices, stables and open spaces. The Rashtrapati Bhavan is a large and vast mansion with four floors and has 340 rooms. It is built on a floor area of 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2). It faces east. A straight east-west road, Rajpath (called King's Way or Kingsway by the British), starts from the huge square, Vijay Chowk, in front of Rashtrapati Bhavan and ends at India Gate on the western end of the road. North Avenue and South Avenue are two approach roads north and south of the estate in perfect symmetry. The east-west road (Rajpath) out of the Rashtrapati Bhawan is flanked by the two huge Central Secretariat buildings (North and South Blocks) that house various ministries of the Government of India. The Parliament House is located at eastern end of North Block.\n\nThe plan of the building is designed around a massive square with multiple courtyards and open inner areas within. The plan called for two wings; one for the Viceroy and residents and another for guests. The residence wing is a separate four-storey house in itself, with its own court areas within. This wing was so large that the first Indian governor-general, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, opted to live the smaller guest wing, a tradition that has since been followed by subsequent presidents. The original residence wing is now used primarily for state receptions and as a guest wing for visiting heads of state.\n\nThe centre of the main wing of the building, underneath the main dome, is the Durbar Hall, which was known as the Throne Room during British rule when it had thrones for the Viceroy and Vicereine (his wife). The interior of this room and almost all the rooms of the palace are bare, relying on stonework and shapes to show austerity rather than intricate decoration. In the hall, the columns are made in Delhi order which combines vertical lines with the motif of a bell. The vertical lines from the column were also used in the frieze around the room, which could not have been done with one of the traditional Greek orders of columns. The hall has a 2-ton chandelier which hangs from a 33-metre height. The two state drawing rooms, the state supper room and the state library are each on the four corners of the hall. \n\nThere are also other rooms such as many loggias (galleries with open air on one side) which face out into the courtyards, a large dining hall with an extremely long table, sitting rooms, billiards rooms, and a large ball room, and staircases. Water features are also through the palace, such as near the Viceroy's stairs, which has eight marble lion statues spilling water into six basins. These lions were symbolic of the heraldry of Great Britain. There is also an open area in one room to the sky, which lets in much of the natural light.\n\nMuseum has etchings of Thomas Daniel and William Daniel and autographed photographs of several Heads of States. Also on display are a number of gift items received by the President during visits abroad or during India and from visiting Heads of State at New Delhi including a dry sunflower which adorned the mortal remains of Mahatma Gandhi on January 31, 1948, 1 K.M. long thread of superfine Khadi spun by a weaver in Nadia Dist. (West Bengal), the 640 Kg. silver chair used by King Emperor at the Delhi Durbar in 1911-12.\n\nSource: Wikipedia & presidentofindia.nic.in\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

He had one of the most prestigious orchestras at hand -- the Vienna Philharmonic with its silken, rich strings, full-throated brass and intricately delineated winds is perfectly suited to Bruckner's dramatic symphonic works. The recording took place in the St. Florian Church in Linz, Austria, where Anton Bruckner is buried, where he was organist and where themes of this symphony were first heard in an organ improvisation in 1886. Boulez's much discussed interpretation is unique in its clarity of the musical structure without loosing the rich expression of the symphony.

The ROV descended to a volcanic cone shaped seamount hoping to find new vents and their associated critters. Instead we were astonished by the diversity of corals, sponges, crinoids, and countless fascinating invertebrates. Personnel were immediately struck by the incredible diversity of colors and species on display as we rose up along the steep WSW slope toward the summit. Some of the organisms imaged included a 30cm wide, 20cm tall sea spider (pycnogonid) whose bright orange spindly legs and specially modified arms were quite a sight to see; a colorful octopus who danced around frantically in search of a place to hide; a large flat fish with big protruding eyes; a striped crinoid; and a wide array of fish of different types and colors including one species that had little feeler fins beneath its pectoral fins. We also saw some large white venus flytrap anemones, many colorful corals of many different species and morphologies, a huge brittle star filter feeding on a rock, large tubular sponges with striped fish feeding inside them, and fluorescent blue mucous nets that stretched up to a meter long from rock to rock.

This is one of those in-betweener animals that almost looks snakelike. It's evolved to have little, almost insignificant arms and legs. It's really a defenseless creature in nature. They're plentiful. \n\nOf the 3,000 plus skinks in the world, I believe over 900 of them are different types of skinks. So of all the different skinks, they're all that elongated body, but only one has got that infamous blue tongue. And that's this one. There's a couple of species of Blue-Tongued Skinks that inhabit Australia and the Indonesian area, but they all use that tongue for the same reason. And that is to scare off or ward off a potential predator. \n\nThis animal hides. It's terrestrial. It's almost fossorial in its approach to life. It stays just underneath the ground. That pattern on its back just blends in to leaf litter, and it stays there kind of a couple of inches under the ground to look for food and to stay away from being food. \n\nBut if encountered by a larger animal, it really doesn't have the ability to run very fast due to those arms and legs. It can't propel itself quickly. It does not climb trees at all. It has no ability to do that because of those arms and legs and its body shape. He swims a little bit, but he's not winning any races getting away from anyone. He's kind of toast if somebody finds him. So, what did nature give him? They gave him that amazing tongue. \n\nAnd oftentimes, in the animal kingdom, color means watch out. Color means poison or venom. And what he'll do is open his mouth and wag his tongue back and forth in an attempt to scare off the predators trying to eat him. Works sometimes, but it's not the greatest method of scaring someone away. \n\nIf someone's pointing a gun at you, you don't stick your tongue out at them. It's not going to work, right? You want to have an ability to run. But the Blue-Tongued Skink doesn't do that. So, oftentimes he becomes prey, not the predator, to a larger animal. Australia would be a large dingo, a cat, or something like that, a larger lizard, or even a snake. That's the Blue-Tongued Skink, one of those Australia animals caught almost in an evolutionary bind. \n\nHe's got a beautiful ear hole there making it clear that he's a lizard. He has that opposable eyelid, but it's those little tiny arms and legs that make it quite funny. Here's a baby one. Another fantastic thing about Blue-Tongued Skinks, first, they're omnivores. They'll eat all types of animals, meat, vegetables, live animals, dead animals, you name it. \n\nYou give a Blue-Tongued Skink something to eat, put it in front of them he's going to have it. But they're also a lizard that has live babies, which is unusual in the lizard world. And this little guy, which is a different subspecies than the adult here, was born just about eight weeks ago. They come out in the placental sac very much alive, no eggs in the Blue-Tongued Skink world.

Color washing is a technique that was basically made very popular in Italy. You'll find it in a lot of the Tuscan walls. It's an absolutely beautiful technique.\n\nYou just need a glaze, you need at least a three or four inch brush, and obviously your base color. So the key is to apply the glaze onto your base. You are going to be working in a cross hatch technique. \n\nThe base I have here is very small, but when you're working on a wall you use your whole arm to make giant X's. So you don't get... I will actually show you how to do that on here, but I'm first getting all the glaze onto my surface. \n\nAnd color washing by and large is done in terracotta, so warm siennas, very Tuscan colors. As you can see, the cross hatching is becoming much bigger. So, having these brush strokes showing is a very, very desirable part of this technique. \n\nAnd if you do want to soften it I have a very special brush here called a badger brush which is made of 100 percent badger hair, and it is used to soften techniques, soften brush marks. And you use it in the direction of the cross hatching. It just gives a nice, mottled look to your finish. \n\nAnd there you have color washing in a single color glaze.", "title": "How to Color Wash a Wall | Paint Techniques", "publishedDate": "2013-07-31T07:53:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Vr-SZyXwLo", "description": "For Tha Sauce:\n1 large carrot\n1 half largeo nion\n2 garlic cloves\n1 bay leaf\n2 pinches dried oregano\n1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce\n300 g minced beef\n1 tbsp tomato puree\n2 tsp red wine\n1 tinned chopped tomatoes (400 g tin)\n50 ml milk\n\nFor The Cheese Sauce:\n25 g butter\n25 g plain flour\n300 ml milk\n1 pinch ground nutmeg\n60 Cheddar\n30 g Parmesan\n\nTo Layer The Lasagne: \n6 'non pre cook' lasagne sheets\n\nFor The Salad:\n1 tsp Dijon mustard\n1 tbsp white wine vinegar\n1 round lettue head (rinsed and dried)\n\nYou Will Also Need:\nsalt and freshly ground blac pepper\nolive oil\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\nTIme 55 minutes", "title": "Midweek Meals - 5 - Gordon's Classic Lasagne Al Forno By Gordon Ramsay", "publishedDate": "2012-01-18T22:42:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "4VrBXhVL1d4", "description": "La renuncia(rectificaci\u00f3n) de Derechos de autor Bajo la Secci\u00f3n 107 del Acto 1976 de Derechos de autor, la concesi\u00f3n es hecha para EL EMPLEO JUSTO para objetivos como la cr\u00edtica, el comentario, el reportaje de noticias, la ense\u00f1anza, la beca, y la investigaci\u00f3n.

Por causa disso, recebem apelidos como escorpi\u00e3o d'\u00e1gua, pica-dedo e toe biters (algo como \"mordedores de p\u00e9, em ingl\u00eas), em alguns pa\u00edses de l\u00edngua inglesa.\nAs baratas d'\u00e1gua podem sair de seu habitat a noite para se acasalarem.

Acredita-se que por serem animais que evolu\u00edram orientando-se pelas estrelas, costumam ser atra\u00eddas por luzes brilhantes, o que faz com que se desorientem, voem em espiral e depois morram de exaust\u00e3o. Por isso, \u00e9 comum aparecerem baratas d'\u00e1gua mortas embaixo de postes de luz. A c\u00f3pula ocorre durante a primavera e os ovos s\u00e3o postos em plantas aqu\u00e1ticas ou em mat\u00e9ria vegetal em decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o.

Acredita-se que isso ocorra porque os machos costumam consumir os ovos e, em suas costas, o acesso torna-se praticamente imposs\u00edvel.\nSe retiradas da \u00e1gua, as baratas d'\u00e1gua costuma fingir-se de mortas e expelir um fluido pelo \u00e2nus.

Although humanity was in such a state, still God's virtue was not lacking; rather, he revealed his mercy and justice. He revealed his mercy when he revealed to Adam and other good people that they would obtain help at a predetermined time. This stirred up their fervor and love for God. He also revealed his justice through the flood in Noah's day, which filled human hearts with the fear of God. Even after that the devil still did not leave off further molesting humankind, but attacked it by means of two other evils. First, he inspired faithlessness in people; second, hopelessness. He inspired faithlessness in order that people might not believe in the word of God but would attribute his wonders to fate. He inspired hopelessness lest they hope to be saved and obtain the glory they had lost.\n\nThe God of virtue supplied two remedies to fight these two evils. Against hopelessness he offered hope, giving Abram a new name and promising him that from his seed there would be born the one who would lead him and the imitators of his faith back to the lost inheritance. He also appointed prophets to whom he revealed the manner of redemption and the times and places of his suffering. With respect to the second evil of faithlessness, God spoke to Moses and revealed his will and the law to him and backed his words up with portents and deeds. Although all this was done, still the devil did not desist from his evil. Constantly urging humankind on to worse sins, he inspired two other attitudes in the human heart: first, that of regarding the law as unbearable and losing peace of mind over trying to live up to it; second, he inspired the thought that God's decision to die and suffer out of charity was too incredible and far too difficult to believe.\n\nAgain God provided two further remedies for these two evils. First, he sent his own Son into the womb of the Virgin so that nobody would lose peace of mind over how hard the Law was to fulfill, since, having assumed a human nature, his Son fulfilled the requirements of the Law and then made it less strict. With respect to the second evil, God displayed the very height of virtue. The Creator died for creation, the righteous one for sinners. Innocent, he suffered to the last drop, as had been foretold by the prophets. Even then the wickedness of the devil did not cease, but again he rose up against humanity, inspiring two further evils. First, he inspired the human heart to hold my words in contempt and, second, to let my deeds fall into oblivion.", "title": "UKRAINE TURNS ITS BACK ON NATO !!! WILL RETURN TO RUSSIA !!!

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "The First Snowfall by James Russell Lowell", "publishedDate": "2013-07-27T10:10:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "4WNFWqAPxOo", "description": "", "title": "Cuscuta, Stanleya and Eriogonum on CA 168", "publishedDate": "2008-12-08T03:26:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "4WNWqQaorSQ", "description": "Ever wanted to be a teenage heartthrob?
