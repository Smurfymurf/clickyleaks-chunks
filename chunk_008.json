You are free of not realising what you are on a momentary basis. You are free of the struggle that looks to hound your day by day living. You are free of being enslaved to a circumstance that appears to keep you imprisoned within its own setup. You are free of it all.\nYou are free as the very love that is this oneness (from which all existence arises) that you have always been and yet seemed not to comprehend. You are this very one right now and there is no need for you to seek it out. Nor is there any need for you to do anything to be it, for you already are it.\nAll you need do is consciously recognise this one that you are. Since it is already true of you, you can. You find the very \"thing\" that you know is \"you\"; the you that you can never get away from; the place that is always right here and with you no matter which way you turn. You find it, you stop as it and you learn to move in your life (through your mind-body complex) from it.\nIt is flowing through your eyes right now; it is flowing through your heart; it is flowing through your whole mind-body package. In fact, it is flowing through all things, seen and unseen. It is your very am-ness, your are-ness. It is the oneness of life itself.\nRealising this one is what will set you free. It is your true nature; it is your heart; it is who you are; it is pure love; it is what you are; it is the oneness of existence.\nAny attempt to try and be this one from the place of you believing yourself to be who you think you are is destined to fail. That is because that field of activity has not the power to do such a thing for you. It is not part of its functioning capacity. There is nothing about your mind-body complexity that is capable of realising what you are. Only you can do that.\nBecoming aware of \"you\" is an essential and important first step. Yes, your mind will most certainly muddy these waters (in the early days of you becoming sensitive to this \"you\") but it can never prevent you from awakening to this one. However, becoming aware of your true nature need not take very long, if you are keen to be truly free.\nOnce you are conscious of what you are you are then to become familiar with it (become attuned to its flavour). This will have you consciously choosing to see and be this \"you\" throughout more of the moments of your daily living. This in turn will awaken you to just how negative the present level of mind, that everyone suffers, is. Seeing this will help you to consciously choose even more moments to be what you are, because those seeings will have you feeling just how painful (and unloving) it is to live like that.\nThus you learn to move in life (via your mind-body) from this place of being the oneness that is already so true of every one. Tremendous freedom becomes a natural move of your daily living.\nRecorded 2006.\n\n\ndimensional shift, Edgar Cayce readings, bashar channellings, changing consciousness, Ascended abilities, spiritual growth, elysha, spiritual teacher, self realized teacher, awakening, enlightenment teacher, spirituality, enlightened teacher, nirvana, meditation, consciousness, reality, freedom, being, satsang, amness, self, oneness, love, happiness, lovebliss, heaven, truth, reincarnation, liberation, karma, zen, unconditional love, light, non-thinking, present moment, awareness, life, heart, mystic, advaita, non duality, lightmind, one, rebirth, existentialism, taoism, darshan, now, contentment, buddha, buddhism, ramana maharshi, eckart tolle, nisargadatta maharaj, adyashanti, mooji, dharma, beauty, harmony, immensity, everything, wonder, it, isness, clarity, bliss, nowhere, exquisiteness, infinity, forever, religiousness, ecstasy, siddhi, trueness, absoluteness, yoga, fulfilment, richness, wholeness, emptiness, nothing, sage, self help, motivation, who you are, who am i, illusion, spiritual meditation, self healing, new age, spiritual guidance, journey of self discovery, surrender, energetic, concepts, flow of energy, motion of seeing, central point, spiritual consciousness, spiritual information, communicating with god, change, earth changes, desire, fear, pleasure, mind informancy, the divine one, consideration, parallel worlds, emergence, existence, david wilcock, micael tsarion, project camelot, jordan maxwell, red ice, philosophy, alex jones, spirit to matter, guru, essence, letting go, a course in miracles, catholic, prayer, god, faith, thoughts, self-awareness, accountability, human understanding, apocalypse, behaviour, nothingness, higher awareness, intuition, psychic skills, myself, oneself, self improvement, self realization fellowship, enlightenment period, meditation techniques, daily meditation, time and being, art of seeing, being philosophy, real eye zation, all seeing eye, manifestation", "title": "Elysha ~ You Are Not The One Who Grows", "publishedDate": "2012-05-30T07:04:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-R_bGM6x5UA", "description": "This lecture clip is from a Level 2 Certificate Course.

Actually you're not because we don't use civilian time in the military. The military uses what's call the military time! Because civilian time isn't good enough for us, so let me teach you how to tell military time so you and your drill serge can be on the same page. First of all civilian use a 12 hour clock, so at noon the clock starts over again at 1pm-okay. The military uses a 24 hour clock, so at noon the number continues; 13, 14, 15 and so on-all the way to twenty four hundred hours or zero hundred hours which is the exact same time. In military time there is no need for an am or pm. The military clock starts at zero hundred hours and ends at twenty three hundred and fifty nine hours. If you drill sergeant tells you to meet at zero eight hundred hours, that means 8am. If your drill sergeant tells you to meet at twenty hundred hours that would be 8pm, so you just add 12 to anything after noon. Pretty simple huh-AS A TIP the morning hour are exactly the same. In the afternoon though you just simply subtract 12 from what your sergeant says. So that's gonna give you the civilian equivalent.

In this video demonstration, we are using resistance bands (Cheer Kinetic Bands) with Ashley to work on improving her cheerleading toe touch. In order to improve your toe touch, we recommend doing a resisted set of jumps, consisting of three toe touches with the Kinetic Bands on. The resistance bands work to help the cheerleader balance and control the hips, while also improving flexibility. it is also important for the cheerleader to keep the chest up for proper technique. We then recommend an un-resisted set of tow touches. There is a clear difference in the height and technique of Ashley's toe touch. You should do three toe touches, this time without using the resistance bands (un-resisted). Consistently training with the Kinetic Bands will work to build hip strength, while also improving balance and flexibility. These are all important to help achieve the toe touch every cheerleader wants. Check out the cheerleading page on our website and get your resistance training started today with our Cheerleading Combo (Cheer Kinetic Bands and Stunt Strap). \n  \nMaximize the benefits of your cheerleading workouts by adding the Cheer Kinetic Bands to your training routine.

However, to the states' soybean farmers, deer are often considered a pest since they consume and thus damage soybeans in fields that are in close proximity to their habitat. To quantify this damage and its economic impact, the MSPB funded a project to estimate the amount of deer predation in soybean fields and measure the potential negative impact of this feeding on soybean yield. The ultimate goal of this study is to relate indices of deer abundance to soybean depredation so that a consumption rate can be determined.

They're very familiar birds, we see them all over the place. They're grey and most of them have some red trimming underneath their feathers on their tail and they're brilliant birds. They are very interactive. They talk probably more than any other species we see, and because they are so socially needy and they really crave attention from their owners, sometimes we get into problems as well, with picking at their feathers and mutilating their skin.  \n\nRealize again these birds live in flocks, of thousands of birds in the wild. They're used to being around other birds all day long. They have jobs. They look for nest sites and mates and food and when we put them in a cage, they're really left there pretty bored. So if you're going to have an African Grey Parrot there are some special considerations you need to make. You want to talk about that, Sarah?\n\nSarah: Sure. One of the biggest recommendations we have for African Grey Parrots is foraging and starting early, giving them things to rip up, giving them ways to look for their food, giving them ways to work for their food. Training, teaching them things, keeping their minds busy.  African Grey's are so very smart and I think a lot of times we don't supply enough mental stimulation for them and that's where we go into behavioral problems.\n\nEspecially with feather picking, where they'll start to pull out their feathers. Unfortunately, once that starts it's very difficult to stop, because oftentimes it's hard to pinpoint exactly where the problem started. If your bird does start feather picking it's always a good idea to have them checked out by your veterinarian anyway, because aside from behavioral issues, other problems can cause feather picking. Internal illnesses and other things like that. So it's always a good idea to bring them to the veterinarian, if they do start that behavior.\n\nDr. Laurie: Absolutely. I mean if you're going to have an African Grey Parrot, African Grey's can live 34 years, sometimes even longer and they do have some special needs. They require an adequate amount of calcium in their diet. We used to see years ago when we saw fewer birds eating pellets; which are actually what we recommend they're nutritionally complete; years ago when they were eating seed, we would see quite a few problems with African Grey's in particular, where they actually tremor and seizure. \n\nFortunately, we don't see that anymore, but it so important to provide them with proper nutrition. With stimulation, the television, the ability to rip and shred and tear, since that's really a part of their natural behavior in the wild. Then again, you just need to make sure that before you get an African Grey, you think about planning ahead for these birds. Good nutrition, good foraging, lots of attention.", "title": "How to Care for an African Grey Parrot | Pet Bird", "publishedDate": "2013-06-22T05:18:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "-RvJqO_GAtk", "description": "Take this course for free on iversity.

Its composer was Johann Gottfried Piefke (1817-1884).\n\n\"Preu\u00dfens Gloria\" (\"The Glory of Prussia\" or \"Prussia's Glory\") was written in 1871 after the Kingdom of Prussia's victory in the Franco-Prussian War, which led to the unification of Germany. For the victory parade of the returned troops the march was performed for the first time in public in Frankfurt (Oder), the base of Piefke's garrison.\n\nAs Piefke only performed it on important occasions, the march was unknown to a broader public for a long time. In 1909 the manuscript of the almost forgotten tune turned up and was reworked by army-musical inspector Prof. Grawert. Shortly afterwards it was included in the collection of Prussian army marches.\n\nToday it is one of the most known German army marches. It is often played by the Bundeswehr on official ceremonies and state visits. It also is a standard tune in many international military bands. In Germany it is often played by non-professional bands due to its popularity. It has also been adopted by units in other armies, for example by the First Squadron, Honourable Artillery Company.", "title": "Preussens Gloria", "publishedDate": "2008-08-16T15:49:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "-SCnvTf2y-Y", "description": "love this band .

Among them are Steve (Ron Howard) and Curt (Richard Dreyfuss), college-bound with mixed feelings about leaving home; nerdy Terry \"The Toad\" (Charles Martin Smith), who scores a dream date with blonde Debbie (Candy Clark); and John (Paul Le Mat ), a 22-year-old drag racer who wonders how much longer he can stay champion and how he got stuck with 13-year-old Carol (Mackenzie Phillips) in his deuce coupe. As D. J. Wolfman Jack spins 41 vintage tunes on the radio throughout the night, Steve ponders a future with girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams), Curt chases a mystery blonde, Terry tries to act cool, and Paul prepares for a race against Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford), but nothing can stop the next day from coming, and with it the vastly different future ushered in by the 1960s. Fresh off The Godfather (1972), producer Francis Ford Coppola had the clout to get his friend George Lucas's project made, but only for $750,000 on a 28-day shooting schedule. Despite technical obstacles, and having to shoot at night, cinematographer Haskell Wexler gave the film the neon-lit aura that Lucas wanted, evoking the authentic look of a suburban strip to go with the authentic sound of rock-n-roll. Universal, which wanted to call the film Another Slow Night in Modesto, thought it was unreleasable. But Lucas' period detail, co-writers Willard Huyck's and Gloria Katz's realistic dialogue, and the film's nostalgia for the pre-Vietnam years apparently appealed to a 1973 audience embroiled in cultural chaos: American Graffiti became the third most popular movie of 1973 (after The Exorcist and The Sting), establishing the reputations of Lucas (whose next film would be Star Wars) and his young cast, and furthering the onset of soundtrack-driven, youth-oriented movies. Although the film helped spark 1970s nostalgia for the 1950s, nothing else would capture the flavor of the era with the same humorous candor and latent sense of foreboding.\n\n\"american graffiti\",\"american graffiti clip\",\"american graffiti soundtrack\",\"american graffiti trailer\",\"american graffiti part 1\",\"american graffiti race\",\"american graffiti movie\",\"jody carlson\",\"george lucas\",\"classic dramas\",\"20th century period pieces\",\"classic comedies\",classics,comedy,drama,\"francis ford coppola\",\"gary kurtz\",\"age videos\",\"embarrassment videos\",\"self esteem videos\",\"car videos\",\"street videos\",\"girl in studebaker\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++1971", "title": "American Graffiti (2/10) Movie CLIP - Wanna Go For A Ride?

On a couple of occasions, though, Gene had to budge over to allow fellow musicians Ewan Whyte and Tom Jackson to fit in a play a solo or two, but other than that, everything you hear on this album comes from the mind, mouth, fingers and heart of Mr. Gene Dudley Esq.\n\n\n\nFans of labels like Truth & Soul and Daptone will relish these sonorous soulful offerings, but the influences on this album are wide ranging. Tracks like \"When The Gorilla Get Grip' and \"The New Lots Of Cooperstown\" conjure up 60's spy soundtracks, but elsewhere there are afro-beat influences on \"The Hilo Bay Halfway\" and more easy, introspective moments on \"Minnie\" and \"Do The Stanley Weinberger\".Just when you think you've got Gene Dudley's sound pinned down, the album culminates with a real game changer in the shaped of the brilliantly titled \"Waxing Unwaxed Lemons\", a quirky, electronic tinged nugget that should please many a dance floor.\n\n\n\nIn the live arena, rather than trying to play all the instruments himself, Gene deploys a quartet of top notch young musicians to help him out (whilst Gene mixes it up between bass and keys throughout the set) as witnessed at the recent Hot 8 Brass Band gig in London, The Gene Dudley Group's debut live show.\n\n\n\nSince that first outing, the group have played to much acclaim at venues such as London's XOYO, and will be celebrating the release of \"Saturday Shifting\" with a live album launch, in support of label mate Henri-Pierre Noel, at The Jazz Caf on July 13th. A night, and an album, not to be missed.\n\nReviews for This Release:\n\n\"Something really special.\" - Huey Morgan (BBC 6Music)\n\n\"Wah Wah 45s' never-ending hunt for exciting funk talent continues as they introduce the one-man-wonder Gene Dudley. A highly talented multi-instrumentalist, Gene plays every note you hear on this 7\", from the tight raspberry blowing horns to the swish-tickling drums. The title track is a Daptone-esque doo-wop with a neat refrain and simple Q&A structure, while \"THe New Lots Of Cooperstown\" meanders a little more into sombre soul territory. Two stunning instrumentals, one memorable introduction - Gene Dudley's talents are likely to take him far.\" - Juno Records (Juno Records)\n\n\"There is no 'negotiation'.

We work incredibly hard to recruit from the local area and have just recruited 350 local people to work in our Dagenham site.\"\n\nThe company is also understood to be writing to Labour to complain about the \"unfair\" slight.\nChris Bryant Controversial: Frontbencher Chris Bryant\n\nMr Bryant's speech appears to be the Opposition's latest attempt to wrestle back the initiative on immigration, which is a top concern for British voters.\n\nThe party is also battling to get on the front foot after a quiet summer which has seen their poll lead slip and Ed Miliband face internal criticism for failing to set the agenda.\n\nMr Bryant will admit immigration can have a negative effect on labour markets, according to extracts from the draft speech reported in The Sunday Telegraph.\n\n\"The biggest complaint I have heard, from migrants and settled communities alike, is about the negative effects migration can have on the UK labour market. And I agree,\" he is due to say.\n\n\"It is unfair that unscrupulous employers whose only interest seems to be finding labour as cheaply as possible will recruit workers in large numbers in low-wage countries in the EU, bring them to the UK, charge the costs of their travel and their substandard accommodation against their wages and still not even meet the national minimum wage.\n\n\"That is unfair. It exploits migrant workers and it makes it impossible for settled workers with mortgages and a family to support at British prices to compete.\"\n\nHe will claim Tesco had recently decided to move its distribution centre in Kent but slashed pay for existing staff, penalising Britons.\n\n\"The new centre is larger and employs more people, but the staff at the original site, most of them British, were told that they could only move to the new centre if they took a cut in pay,\" he will say.\n\n\"The result? A large percentage of the staff at the new centre are from [the] Eastern bloc.\"\n\nAs well as highlighting the recruitment of hundreds of local staff, Tesco made clear that the distribution centre is in the east London borough of Barking and Dagenham and was formerly in Essex, not Kent.", "title": "Labour Attacks Tesco Over Foreign Staff", "publishedDate": "2013-08-11T12:21:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "-SczJjRgw6A", "description": "I love the original theme, so tried to create a longer version.", "title": "IronMan Cartoon Theme 1996 Intro Extended", "publishedDate": "2011-05-10T21:10:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "-SczUsBZMmA", "description": "Emotionale Bilder von Bollers Abschied aus dem Profifu\u00dfball.

Apparently we all wished it into existence! After splitting from Eva Mendes, Ryan Gosling is reportedly back with Rachel McAdams. So apparently Rachel is the one that is really trying to make it happen here. A source tells Ok! Magazine: \"Rachel is pushing hard to get him back and he's becoming more and more receptive to her. They talk and message each other all the time.\" BTW, these two met on the set of 'The Notebook' in 2004, dated from 2005 to 2007, split up, then briefly got back together in 2008. Ryan previously implied that Rachel was his great love. Apparently she was heartbroken and devastated after her breakup with Michael Sheen, so she reached out to Ryan. Now she is listening to his heartbreak over his split with Eva. The source says: \"Rachel is playing it really smart and letting Ryan vent about Eva and not obviously pushing but she's ready and waiting for him to come back to her.\"", "title": "Ryan Gosling Back With Rachel McAdams", "publishedDate": "2013-11-13T23:46:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Sf5UUtpfy0", "description": "Fuchs tot Jagdhornsignal", "title": "Fuchs tot Jagdhornsignal", "publishedDate": "2010-03-22T08:26:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Sfl1clBb18", "description": "Link to order this clip:\nhttp://www.criticalpast.com/video/65675074464_Hermann-Goring_Feldherrnhalle_Goering-birthday_Storm-troopers-march\nHistoric Stock Footage Archival and Vintage Video Clips in HD.\n\nHermann Goering reviews parading Storm troopers of the SA-Regiment Feldherrnhalle, on his birthday, in Munich, Germany\n\nHermann Goering stands in an open car and reviews SA-Regiment Feldherrnhalle Stormtroopers,of which he has been made honorary Commander, as they march in Munich, Germany.

It forms part of the border between the Province of Ontario in Canada (on the west) and New York State in the United States. There are differing theories as to the origin of the name of the river. According to Iroquoian scholar Bruce Trigger, \"Niagara\" is derived from the name given to a branch of the locally residing native Neutral Confederacy, who are described as being called the \"Niagagarega\" people on several late-17th-century French maps of the area.[3] According to George R. Stewart, it comes from the name of an Iroquois town called \"Ongniaahra\", meaning \"point of land cut in two\".[4]\nThe river, which is occasionally described as a strait,[5] is about 56 kilometres (35 mi) long and includes Niagara Falls in its course. The falls have moved approximately 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) upstream from the Niagara Escarpment in the last 12,000 years, resulting in a gorge below the falls. Today, the diversion of the river for electrical generation has significantly reduced the rate of erosion.\nPower plants on the river include the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Power Stations on the Canadian side, and the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant (built in 1961) on the American side. Together, they generate 4.4 gigawatts of electricity. The International Control Works, built in 1954, regulates the river flow. Ships on the Great Lakes use the Welland Canal, part of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, on the Canadian side of the river, to bypass Niagara Falls.\nThe total drop in elevation along the river is 99 metres (325 ft). The Niagara Gorge extends downstream from the Falls and includes the Niagara Whirlpool and another section of rapids.\nThe Niagara River also features two large islands and numerous smaller islands. Grand Island and Navy Island, the two largest islands, are on the American and Canadian sides of the river, respectively. Goat Island and the tiny Luna Island split Niagara Falls into its three sections, the Horseshoe, Bridal Veil, and American Falls. Squaw Island lies further upstream, alongside the city of Buffalo.\nThe Niagara River and its tributaries, Tonawanda Creek and the Welland River, formed part of the last section of the Erie Canal and Welland Canal. After leaving Lockport, New York, the Erie Canal proceeds southwest until it enters Tonawanda Creek. After entering the Niagara River, watercraft then proceed southward to the final lock, where a short section of the canal allows boats to avoid the turbulent shoal water at the river intake and enter Lake Erie.\nThe Welland Canals used the Welland River as a connection to the Niagara River south of the falls, allowing water traffic to safely re-enter the Niagara River and proceed to Lake Erie.", "title": "Niagara Falls, Ontario 11/2013", "publishedDate": "2013-12-02T13:46:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "-T66xmOsi4A", "description": "The story of Irish support for the Union cause during the American Civil War, their love of new found American liberty and distrust of the English \"John Bull\"", "title": "Opinions of Paddy Magee.wmv", "publishedDate": "2010-06-27T17:27:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "-T6LVNMY-JM", "description": "", "title": "Melaena at Sunset Ribs", "publishedDate": "2010-07-21T02:34:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "-T6sGv7qL-0", "description": "Oops, they weren't logs after all: The moment a crocodile was killed after taking a foolish shortcut across a herd of hippos.", "title": "Hippo Kills Crocodile Video", "publishedDate": "2012-07-28T06:11:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "-T7SqoFADWI", "description": "", "title": "de escalation video", "publishedDate": "2013-10-04T06:21:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "-T7Te2ZTOfU", "description": "Heavy snow fall in Seattle causing traffic problems and minor accidents.

In legacy the venue will provide two 50m swimming pools, a diving pool and dry diving area for community and elite use. The 'big lift' of the roof began in March.

It is part of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. Neighbouring provinces are Bangkok, to the north and west, and Chachoengsao to the east. Suvarnabhumi Airport (or also called New Bangkok International Airport) is located in the Bang Phli district of Samut Prakan province.\nThe province was created during the Ayutthaya period, with its administrative centre located at Phra Pradaeng. It was the sea port of Siam, and was secured with forts, town moats and town-walls. King Rama II started the building of the new centre at Samut Prakan in 1819, after his predecessor King Taksin had disbanded the town fortification. Altogether six forts were built on both sides of the Chao Phraya river, and on an island in the river the pagoda Phra Samut Chedi was erected. These were involved in the Paknam incident of 13 July 1893, which ended the Franco-Siamese War with  the French naval blockade of Bangkok. Of the original six forts only two exist today, Phi Sua Samut and Phra Chulachomklao.\nIn Thai the word Samut is from Sanskrit, samudra, meaning ocean or sea, and the word Prakan is from Sanskrit, pr\u0101k\u0101ra, meaning fortress, walls or stronghold.\nThe provincial seal shows the temple Phra Samut Chedi, the most important site of Buddhist worship in the province. Provincial tree is Thespesia populnea. The provincial slogan is Marine Battle Fortresses, Chedi in the Water, Crocodile Farm, Exquisite Ancient City, Phra Pradaeng Songkran Festival, Tasty Dried Snakeskin Gourami, Rap Bua Festival, Industrial Estate.\nSamut Prakan is located at the mouth of the Chao Phraya river to the Gulf of Thailand. Thus the province is also sometimes called Pak Nam  the Thai word for the mouth of a river. The part of the province located on the western side of the river consist mostly of rice and prawn fields as well as mangrove forests, while the east part is the urban centre - including industrial factories. It is part of the Bangkok metropolis, the urbanization on both sides of the provincial boundary is identical. The province has a coastline of about 47.2 kilometres. Bang Pu Nature Reserve, about 12 km east of the town centre, has a large bird population. Especially during the winter the Sakdi pier at Bang Pu is very popular for Thai people feeding the wintering seagulls. The park is run jointly by the Royal Thai Army and the Thai WWF, and was officially established at the 72nd birthday of Queen Sirikit in 2004.\nMonastery of no sorrow, Soi Sukhaphiban 58, Tambon Thai Ban, Sukhumvit Road, Samut Prakan 10280. Located 32 km south of Bangkok off Highway  3. Many city buses in Bangkok ( including air conditioned 7 and 8, and non-air conditioned 25, 142, 145 ) go to Samut Prakan; from here you can take either of two local buses or a taxi six km farther to the temple.\nSome buses between Bangkok's Eastern ( Ekkamai ) Bus Terminal and Chonburi go via Samut Prakan; ask to be let off at Wat Asokaram ( between KM 31 and 32 posts on Highway 3 ), then walk or take a samlor about one km south. You can see the spires and multi tiered roof of the viharn from the highway.  Telephone : 0-2395-0003   \nAs one of the province's major temples, it has many spots of interest such as Phra Thutangkhachedi ( Dhutangachedi ) which is a complex of 13 Chedi's, and Wihan Wisuthithammarangsi, a three storey building with four porches and a superstructure in the form of a Mondop.  \nAnapanasati is the main technique taught, though mediators are free to choose their own techniques\nDiscourses are given each evening. ( Meditation practice receives much emphasis in the Dhamma talks.) Teachers are available for questions.\nTeachers Ajahn Tong ( Phra Khru Suvandhamma chote ), abbot  senior monks assistant  Phra Ajahn Bunku Anuvathano speaks good English . A few monks  can speak English; the abbot does not.\nA temple built in ancient India by Emperor Asoka inspired the name of Wat Asokaram. Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo ( 1906-1961), a disciple of Ajahn Mun, founded the temple in 1955. At the request of lay followers, the un cremated remains of Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo have been kept in a coffin in the glassed in shrine area upstairs in the Viharn. A ceremony dedicated to the former abbot attracts many people to the Wat on 24-26 April; teachers present discourses on mind training in the Ajahn Mun tradition.", "title": "Samut Prakan Province, Wat Asokaram, Monastery of no sorrow, Samut Prakan, Thailand.

We just have to lower our expectations and realize that any system will have variable outcomes. This is to a degree because of the inconsistencies of the market and partly because of the inconsistencies of human traders.\n\nAll we require is a method that returns an continuing profit. It does not have to be huge profit, it will add up over time. It does not have to be always successful, either.

The swans' close relatives include the geese and ducks. Swans are grouped with the closely related geese in the subfamily Anserinae where they form the tribe Cygnini. Sometimes, they are considered a distinct subfamily, Cygninae. There are six or seven species of swan in the genus Cygnus; in addition there is another species known as the coscoroba swan, although this species is no longer considered one of the true swans. Swans usually mate for life, though \"divorce\" does sometimes occur, particularly following nesting failure. And if a mate dies, or is killed by a predator, the remaining mate will take up with another; however, if all goes well in the pairing, they indeed will stay together for life. The number of eggs in each clutch ranges from three to eight.\nSwans feed in the water and on land. They are almost entirely herbivorous, although they may eat small amounts of aquatic animals. In the water food is obtained by up-ending or dabbling, and their diet is composed of the roots, tubers, stems and leaves of aquatic and submerged plants.Although swans only reach sexual maturity between 4 and 7 years of age, they can form socially monogamous pair bonds from as early as 20 months that last for many years, and in some cases these can last for life. The lifespan of the mute swan is often over 10 years, and sometimes over 20, whereas the black-necked swan survives for less than a decade in captivity. These bonds are maintained year round, even in gregarious and migratory species like the tundra swan, which congregate in large flocks in the wintering grounds. The nest is on the ground near water and about a metre across. Unlike many other ducks and geese the male helps with the nest construction. Average egg size (for the mute swan) is 113\u00d774 mm, weighing 340 g, in a clutch size of 4 to 7, and an incubation period of 34\u201345 days.

The Heating is about as warm as a hot tub. Research has shown that heat can damage or kill cancer cells in some tumors while also making radiation and chemotherapy more effective.\n\nWhile it has been known for hundreds of years that fevers can kill cancer, only recently has technology been developed that can control and focus heat specifically on tumors.\n\nLocal hyperthermia treatment (heat applied to a very small area, such as a tumor) is a well-established cancer treatment. Primary malignant tumors have a bad blood circulation, which make them more sensitive to changes in temperature.\n\n\n\"Our own clinical experience and the results of numerous published studies are highly encouraging in that increased use of hyperthermia will improve the quality of life for cancer patients and improve control of cancer recurrences.\"\n\nDr. Gerald Sokol, New Hope Cancer Center, Hudson, FL.\n\n\n\"Hyperthermia is offering our patients new hope. We are often seeing faster responses, better cancer control, and fewer side effects.\"\n\nDr. Leland Rogers, GammaWest, Salt Lake City, Utah\n\n\n\"Hyperthermia gives us a method to treat people when there are few other alternatives. It's an additional form of treatment that can be done in difficult cases, usually without serious side effects or complications.\"\n\nDr. Steven Stroup, Centennial Hospital, Nashville, Tenn.\n\n\n\"When the tumor is of larger size, it is unresectable surgically. Also, radiation has less effect on the center part of the tumor, which is deprived of the oxygen blood supply and the nutrients. By increasing the temperature of the tissues from 42-44 degrees centigrade, (hyperthermia) increases the circulation, increases the oxygenation, so that the radiation is more effective.\"\n\nNasir Syed, Long Beach Memorial Center, Long Beach, CA", "title": "CGI animation showing how Hyperthermia attacks a tumor.", "publishedDate": "2007-12-09T14:09:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-TiF-MqLqOU", "description": "", "title": "Verso Dusanbe", "publishedDate": "2013-08-03T17:17:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "-TigGH5jSTA", "description": "Video a friend of mine took of the didcot power station cooling towers being demolished viewed from th air.\n\nSubscribe to follow me on my FPV and RC adventures. http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWpmVa7TRGQ9UID-8lCzzLQ?sub_confirmation=1", "title": "Didcot power station demolition viewed from the air by a drone.  27/07/2014", "publishedDate": "2014-07-27T06:09:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Tj7oCdVZ6s", "description": "Aphrodite - The Bomber Style (dnb[1].no.lvl)", "title": "Aphrodite - The Bomber Style (dnb[1].no.lvl)", "publishedDate": "2007-10-27T13:30:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "-TjUvhyEHDY", "description": "Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nWorld leaders dress in brightly coloured silk shirts for a gala dinner on the eve of the ASEAN summit in the Myanmar capital, in what has become a tradition for the event.

(Wouldn't wanna be him, havin' to face his department.) \"He came up and tried to sneak a picture of my daughter climbing out of this wagon in a short dress\"... Authorities did not identify the officer, but confirmed that he works for the Los Angeles Police Department... The man was not arrested and police said the photos of the children were not considered pornographic. Police, however, took his camera but did not confiscate his gun because he has a badge.\n(I though these guys were never off duty?)\n\nLAPD Cop Admits Guilt in OC Kiddie Picture Arousal Case\n\nA visibly nervous Ralph Cameron Lakin II (pictured) stood out this morning in Superior Court Judge Steven Bromberg's courtroom not just because he wore a natty suit (tan slacks, green coat and floral-patterned tie), but also because the other criminal defendants awaiting attention were hoodlums or drug addicts while he served as a veteran cop in the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nOn May 26, 2007, Lakin was captured at the Garden Grove Strawberry Festival secretly filming the crotch areas of eight unwitting, underaged girls, as he confessed today in a pretrial guilty plea, \"with the intent to sexually gratify\" himself.\n\nAt the time, the incident appeared on numerous LA-based television news broadcasts because Lakin had the misfortune of selecting as one of his victims the daughter of Mark Dornan, son of one of Southern California's most famous politicians, retired Congressman Robert K. Dornan. Even the OC Register featured the crime. Lakin quickly retired in the aftermath.\n\nThe younger Dornan, a schoolteacher and man not known for fence-straddling or meekness, chased Lakin down, wrestled away the cop's gun and camera, and held him for local police. The sensational citizen's arrest prompted the Weekly to name Dornan \"Father of the Year\" in 2008.\n\nAssistant District Attorney James Laird, who heads the DA's West Court prosecution efforts, said he agreed to a plea deal that required Lakin to confess to eight misdemeanors. After the dismissal of a child-porn possession count, punishment includes no jail time, but four years of formal, supervised probation, 100 hours of community service, a $1,000 fine and professional counseling.\n\nIt's pathetic that a 55-year-old man finds himself banned from all future Strawberry Festivals and \"any/all festival activities such as parades.\" Although he escaped sex-crime charges, the La Palma resident also will have to register with local police agencies as a sex offender for four years. If he violates probation, he faces up to four years in the Orange County Jail, according to Bromberg.", "title": "Man Takes Down A Pedophile Police Officer at festival", "publishedDate": "2009-10-10T18:04:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "-TqHr9ImV3Y", "description": "Live@Gopalan Mall Bangalore", "title": "Urvashi+Gangnam Style+Kolaveri Di Mash Up by Vinayak Singh", "publishedDate": "2014-01-15T18:48:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Tr3E0hJhw0", "description": "vykl\u00e1dka u Prahy, firma Tyrrell", "title": "ETS2 Honeyed Paradise 0.91 part3", "publishedDate": "2013-06-08T09:15:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Tr7TlKD8dk", "description": "", "title": "Resident Evil 4 - Osmund Saddler kill Luis Sera", "publishedDate": "2013-11-17T12:18:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Tr8hrC0Mg0", "description": "Get the recipe @ http://allrecipes.com/recipe/slow-cooker-stuffing-2/detail.aspx\n\nWatch how to make amazing stuffing in your slow cooker.

Kroos - Thymus (Original Mix)\n\nBeatport: http://bit.ly/SILKTX029\niTunes: http://bit.ly/SILKTX029-iTunes\n\nStephen J. Kroos, the veteran Dutch talent who has released countless classics (including two full-length albums), needs little introduction; we're truly thrilled to feature him on this marvelous two-track EP. As can be said for the majority of his more recent work, Kroos continues to push the boundaries of sound design, with elements of techno, deep house, progressive, and downtempo fusing together to create outer-wordly soundscapes.\n\nThe title cut here, \"Thymus\", features a variety of bell sounds, as well as a flurry of vox stabs and distorted samples. In the main break, the listener is set \"adrift\" through an evocative atmosphere, while a robotic vox sample and other effects bleed through the mix. The \"hoppy\" beat that appears in the \"drop\" feels especially welcome after this extended interlude.\n\nThe B-side in this EP, \"Inspirience\", is a laid-back affair, which magically transports you into a shady grove on a lazy summer afternoon. You can literally hear the bees buzzing and birds chirping, as an otherwise care-free beat gently pushes you along. A variety of tremolo'ed melody lines delicately dance along to the beat, adding to the hypnotic, escapist thrill of the tune.\n\nStephen J.

The group contains over 13,000 species, all of which are terrestrial. Although their name suggests they have myriad (10,000) legs, myriapods range from having over 750 legs (Illacme plenipes) to having fewer than ten legs.\n\nThe fossil record of myriapods reaches back into the late Silurian, although molecular evidence suggests a diversification in the Cambrian Period, and Cambrian fossils exist which resemble myriapods. The oldest unequivocal myriapod fossil is of the millipede Pneumodesmus newmani, from the late Silurian (428 million years ago). P. newmani is also important as the earliest known terrestrial animal. The phylogenetic classification of myriapods is still debated.\n\nThe scientific study of myriapods is myriapodology, and those who study myriapods are myriapodologists\n\n\n\nMyriapoda \u00e9 um subfilo dos artr\u00f3podes que agrupa os animais segmentados com um elevado n\u00famero de pernas, como as lacraias e os piolhos-de-cobra.\n\nOs miri\u00e1podes s\u00e3o agregados com os Hexapoda (insetos e classes pr\u00f3ximas) num grupo geralmente sem categoria taxon\u00f3mica denominado Tracheata, antigoUniramia, que inclui os artr\u00f3podes cujos ap\u00eandices n\u00e3o s\u00e3o ramificados.\n\nS\u00e3o tradicionalmente divididos em quatro classes: quil\u00f3podes (lacraias), dipl\u00f3podes (piolho-de-cobra), paur\u00f3podes e s\u00ednfilos e agregam aproximadamente 13.000 esp\u00e9cies.\n\n\n\u591a\u8db3\u985e\uff0c\u662f\u7bc0\u80a2\u52d5\u7269\u9580\u4e0b\u7684\u55ae\u80a2\u4e9e\u9580\uff08\u5b78\u540dMyriapoda\uff0c\u6216\u7a31\u591a\u8db3\u4e9e\u9580\u6216\u591a\u8db3\u7db1\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u99ac\u9678\u53ca\u8708\u86a3\u7b49\u3002\u591a\u8db3\u985e\u6709\u8d85\u904e13000\u500b\u7269\u7a2e\uff0c\u90fd\u662f\u9678\u5730\u52d5\u7269\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u7260\u5011\u7684\u5b78\u540d\u6307\u5176\u6709\u4e00\u842c\u96bb\u8173\uff0c\u4f46\u5be6\u969b\u4e0a\u8173\u7684\u6578\u76ee\u6700\u591a\u53ea\u6709\u7d04750\u96bb\uff08Illacme plenipes\uff09\uff0c\u5c11\u81f310\u96bb\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3002\u7260\u5011\u6709\u4e00\u5c0d\u89f8\u89d2\u53ca\u55ae\u773c\u3002\n\n\u591a\u8db3\u985e\u5927\u591a\u68f2\u606f\u5728\u6fd5\u6f64\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u8150\u6557\u7684\u690d\u7269\u70ba\u4e3b\u98df\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u89e3\u690d\u7269\u7684\u907a\u9ad4\u4e0a\u626e\u6f14\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8173\u8272\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ecd\u6709\u5c11\u90e8\u4efd\u591a\u8db3\u985e\u68f2\u606f\u5728\u8349\u539f\u3001\u534a\u4e7e\u65f1\u5730\u5340\u6216\u751a\u81f3\u662f\u6c99\u6f20\u4e4b\u4e2d\u3002\u5927\u90e8\u4efd\u591a\u8db3\u985e\u751f\u7269\u90fd\u662f\u8349\u98df\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6578\u7684\u5507\u8db3\u7db1\u662f\u591c\u884c\u6027\u7684\u63a0\u98df\u8005\u3002\u5c11\u8db3\u7db1\u53ca\u7d9c\u5408\u7db1\u90fd\u662f\u76f8\u7576\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u751f\u7269\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u571f\u58e4\u4e2d\u3002\u500d\u8db3\u7db1\u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u591a\u8db3\u985e\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8eab\u9ad4\u5206\u7bc0\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u7bc0\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u5169\u5c0d\u8173\uff1b\u5176\u4ed6\u591a\u8db3\u985e\u751f\u7269\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u7bc0\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u5c0d\u8173\u3002\n\n\u96d6\u7136\u666e\u904d\u8a8d\u70ba\uff0c\u591a\u8db3\u985e\u5c0d\u4eba\u985e\u6c92\u6709\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u4f46\u8a31\u591a\u591a\u8db3\u985e\u751f\u7269\u6703\u5206\u6ccc\u6709\u6bd2\u7684\u7269\u8cea\uff08\u4e00\u822c\u5305\u542b\u918c\uff09\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u76ae\u819a\u4e0a\u9020\u6210\u77ed\u66ab\u7684\u6c34\u6ce1\u53ca\u8b8a\u8272\u3002\n\n\u96d6\u7136\u591a\u8db3\u985e\u7684\u5916\u6bbc\u8584\u4e14\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u65bc\u5f62\u6210\u5316\u77f3\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u76f8\u7576\u591a\u7684\u5316\u77f3\u8b49\u64da\uff0c\u986f\u793a\u591a\u8db3\u985e\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u5f88\u53e4\u8001\u7684\u751f\u7269\u3002\u51fa\u73fe\u5728\u5bd2\u6b66\u7d00\u7684\u55ae\u80a2\u52d5\u7269\u5316\u77f3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u985e\u4f3c\u591a\u8db3\u751f\u7269\u7684\u578b\u614b\uff1b\u800c\u5df2\u78ba\u8a8d\u6700\u65e9\u7684\u591a\u8db3\u985e\u5316\u77f3\uff0c\u5247\u51fa\u571f\u65bc\u5fd7\u7559\u7d00\u665a\u671f\u7684\u5730\u5c64\u3002\u6700\u65e9\u7684\u8708\u86a3\u5316\u77f3\u51fa\u571f\u65bc\u6ce5\u76c6\u7d00\u5730\u5c64\uff0c\u986f\u793a\u591a\u8db3\u985e\u7684\u578b\u614b\u5728\u6ce5\u76c6\u7d00\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5df2\u7d93\u958b\u59cb\u51fa\u73fe\u8b8a\u5316\u3002\u82e5\u4ee5\u6838\u7cd6\u9ad4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f86\u63a8\u7b97\uff0c\u591a\u8db3\u985e\u751f\u7269\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u59cb\u65bc\u6ce5\u76c6\u7d00\n\n\nDie Tausendf\u00fc\u00dfer (Myriapoda; auch Tausendf\u00fc\u00dfler) sind ein Unterstamm der Gliederf\u00fc\u00dfern (Arthropoda), sie umfassen ausschlie\u00dflich landlebende Formen mit einer meist zwei- oder h\u00f6chstens dreistelligen Anzahl von Beinen.\n\nMitunter wird die Bezeichnung Tausendf\u00fc\u00dfer in einem engeren Sinne auf die Klasse der meist pflanzenfressenden Doppelf\u00fc\u00dfer beschr\u00e4nkt, die mit etwa 10.000 bekannten Arten den Gro\u00dfteil der Gruppe stellen. 3000 bekannte Arten umfassen die fleischfressenden Hundertf\u00fc\u00dfer.

Soil samples taken in 2005 by the Missouri Department of Natural resources found at least three places along St. Charles Rock Road with unusually high levels of Thorium 230, a radioactive isotope that has been linked to certain types of cancer. Thorium 230 does occur naturally. A spokesman for the St. Louis Army Corps of Engineers tells NewsChannel 5 the isotope is usually found in north St. Louis County in average levels of 1.5 pCi/g. Three soil samples collected by the DNR found areas with 8.81 pCi/g, 5.41 pCi/g and 4.41 pCi/g respectively. While the levels are considerably higher than what is naturally occurring, experts say they do not pose an immediate threat to human health. The Army Corps of Enigneers' Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program is currently working to remediate other radioactive sites in the St. Louis area. A spokesman says Thorium 230 would have to be found in levels of 14 pCi/g or higher before FUSRAP would move in to clean up the area", "title": "HEADS UP EVERYONE State of Missouri Area West Lake Landfill Superfund Site", "publishedDate": "2014-06-17T03:51:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UCDSWPm8lY", "description": "The technique of Intravenous (IV) access", "title": "Intravenous (IV) access", "publishedDate": "2011-07-27T05:14:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UCawBQsPi4", "description": "Kristen Bell and a Frozen sequel?

It took an astounding 136 space flights on seven different types of launch vehicles to build the international space station. The first ISS module, was launched by a Proton rocket on 20th November 1998 and was called Zarya. \n\n2. The ISS as it's referred to flies at around 4.791 miles per second, that's 17,248 miles per hour. It competes nearly 16 orbits a day and is fast enough to go to the Moon and back in under 24 hours.\n\n3. The ISS is so big it could span the area of an American football field, the complex includes two bathrooms, a gymnasium and a 360-degree bay window. On completion it has more space than a six bedroom house. \n\n4. The International Space Station is not only an orbiting laboratory, but also a space port for a variety of international spacecraft, there have been 89 Russian launches, 37 Space Shuttle launches, 3 flights by SpaceX's Dragon, 3 Japanese HTVs and 3 European ATVs. \n\n5. The first expedition was in October 2000 and lasted for nearly 137 days. Since then over 200 people from 15 countries have visited the ISS and a 174 space walks have been completed, totalling almost 1,100 hours, or nearly 46 days.\n\n6. According to NASA, there are 52 computers controlling the International Space Station. The US segment have 1.5 million lines of flight software code run on 44 computers communicating via 100 data networks and transferring 400,000 signals.\n\n7. The International Space Station robotic arm was launched in April 2001 and is called Canadarm2. It is 57.7 feet long when fully extended and has seven motorized joints. This arm is capable of handling large payloads and helped build the entire orbiting complex.\n\nAttributes- \n\"Tempting Secrets\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "title": "7 Mind-Blowing Facts About The International Space Station", "publishedDate": "2014-03-16T16:58:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UGlgU03a60", "description": "so pra voce", "title": "so pra voce", "publishedDate": "2012-04-16T16:28:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UGryqnxM7o", "description": "Un'omaggio al Duomo di Orvieto capolavoro del gotico italiano.\n\nPanasonic GH2\nOttiche: 7-14, 14-140, canon 80-200\nMontaggio: Final Cut Pro X\n\nA tribute to the Orvieto Cathedral masterpiece of Italian Gothic.\n\nPanasonic GH2\nOptics: 7-14, 14-140, 80-200 canon\nEditing: Final Cut Pro X", "title": "I LUOGHI DELL'ARTE E DELLA NATURA - Il Duomo di Orvieto", "publishedDate": "2014-01-02T10:22:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UGt1ncEKgA", "description": "Watch a sneak peek from Come Fly With Me, a British mocumentary-style comedy series airing in BBC America's upcoming Saturday night comedy block.

I'd like to show you how I stretch 140 pound watercolor paper. I find that the easiest way in the world to do a watercolor is on stretched paper. So I'd like to take just a couple of minutes and show you how you can do the same thing. \n\nI have my watercolor paper with my drawing on it, my Gatorboard, and I can actually turn my Gatorboard over and get rid of the marks on it. I have a 2 inch flat Golden Fleece Wash brush. I have my water that I've added a little bit of color to so that you can see it. I simply start applying water to my watercolor that I'm going to be doing. The thing to remember is that you cannot get it too wet. So we're going to soak this thing and once it's absolutely soaking on the front, I turn it over on the back where I have scribbled and I soak it again. We're going to take a little break and let this water soak in and we'll be right back to show you the whole process. \nWe've saturated the paper on both sides. It has soaked for about 15 minutes and now I'm going to turn it over. This is the side I'm going to paint on. This is a very important step so please watch carefully. I take a roll of paper towels and lay across it like that. I take another roll of paper towels and lay across it like that. Take some more paper towels and lay across it. So now I have two layers of paper towels at the top. I take my hands and in the middle press down very hard while pushing to the sides. What I'm doing here is taking the excess water off of this paper. Lift the paper towels up and lay them to one side so they can dry and now I am ready to paint right now. You would say \"You can't paint on that because it's going to run\". Well it isn't, watch what happens when I do this. Look there, it stay right there. It allows me all of this time to come in here and saturate this color in here without getting hard edges. I can work and work and work now. And I save my detail until the very end. \n\nThat's how you stretch watercolor paper. It's the easiest way in the world to do a watercolor because you can soften those edges or you can wait until toward the end, dry it with a hair dryer and put all the detail in that you want to. Happy art, thanks for your business, we'll be back with more tips soon.", "title": "Wetting and Stretching Watercolor Paper, cheapjoes.com", "publishedDate": "2007-07-23T17:15:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UOaEmwqKKg", "description": "", "title": "baste harlemshake", "publishedDate": "2013-03-14T12:15:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UOi_08PxfY", "description": "HAUS  DECANTER CENTRIFUGES/ HAUS SANTR\u0130F\u00dcJ DEKANT\u00d6R\nhttp://www.haus.com.tr", "title": "HAUS  DECANTER CENTRIFUGES/ HAUS SANTR\u0130F\u00dcJ DEKANT\u00d6R", "publishedDate": "2012-08-28T13:18:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UOx4igvQSg", "description": "Harness your rugby psychology with this Mental Skills Training (MST) package from Dr Simon Payne at Your Excellence Unlocked (Swansea).

This group of pests generally includes golden coloured moths and small beetles which have a variety of different colours and shapes.\n\nThe damage caused by these insects (which is often irregular holes in fabric & clothes) is always done by the young larval stage. At this point in their lives they generally look like small caterpillars or grubs - and certainly completely different to the adult insect. Textile pests will feed on a wide variety of naturally occurring materials, including animal hair and hide, cottons, wools (especially cashmere), feathers and horn. They will not feed on 'man made' materials, while those that contain a mix of natural and synthetic fibres may suffer only some damage. The moth and beetle larvae will mainly feed in quiet undisturbed locations, such as underneath heavy furniture and around it's feet, around the edges of carpets, in wardrobes and drawers and in stored clothes and fabrics. Most species tend to prefer fabrics that are stained with sweat - so it is always best to ensure clothes and fabrics are cleaned before storage.\n\nBeetle pests in this category will typically be seen clustered on windowsills as they try to leave the property to feed on nectar outside. Moths however are quite lazy and do not generally move far from where they are feeding. As a result you tend to only see evidence of these pests when you notice the damage they cause.\n\nAll these insects generally cause most damage during the warmer summer months; however, in very warm homes the period of feeding can be extended. A female generally can lay several hundred eggs in her lifetime and therefore if you notice these pests it is wise to take action sooner rather than later to minimise the impact that they have on your possessions.\n\nFor more information, visit www.rentokil.com", "title": "Textile Pests - Clothes Moths and Carpet Beetles Rentokil", "publishedDate": "2012-04-03T14:42:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UWCNFPpLBA", "description": "Are brad pitts tattoos in movies real?\nSemi permanent tattoos?\nI need help with tattoo? meanings.?\nDo you like man with tattoo? or with out tattoo?\nTattoo? shops chicago?\nTattoo?--how well will white tattoo? ink stand up?\nHow much are tattoos at elm street tattoo?\nNeck tattoo? pain vs rib cage tattoo?\nCan people get their tongue tattooed?\nTattoo? 46 or pure ink? jersey tattoos?\nTattoos and christians - should christians have tattoos?\nIs there a way to  itest-drive i a tattoo? before committing?\nA tattoo? kit in the bay area?\nDoes a lower back tattoo? hurt more than a foot tattoo?", "title": "Tattoos - Phoenix Arizona   Shoulder Removed Du", "publishedDate": "2013-10-27T16:22:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UWGaAzHFag", "description": "Picking a few catalpa worms from the backyard tree and doing a little fishing at the pond.", "title": "Fishing with Catalpa Worms", "publishedDate": "2014-07-25T02:14:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UWZt0TZYHc", "description": "This is what you have all been waiting for, it is the best version of Dreamstreet Gayness.

After hitting an all-time low, giving a lecture to elementary school kids, Dr. Marshall meets an ambitious young scientist named Holly (Anna Friel), who tells him she has followed all his work and believes he's a genius. Spurred on by her enthusiasm, he finishes building the device that will allow him to time travel -- something he promptly does along with Holly, and white-trash fireworks salesman Will (Danny McBride), after Will leads them into a cave that seems like a promising place to test the new machine. They end up in a world full of dinosaurs, sand, and scary lizard-like creatures known as Sleestacks. They quickly lose the machine that brought them to this alternate universe, and if they ever want to return home, the trio must recover it with the help of Chaka (Jorma Taccone), the monkey-like friend they make in this strange place.\n\n\"land of the lost\",\"land of the lost clip\",\"land of the lost trailer\",\"land of the lost part 1\",\"will ferrell\",\"danny mcbride\",\"jorma taccone\",\"anna friel\",\"dennis mcnicholas\",\"dinosaur videos\",\"ferris wheel videos\",\"ice cream videos\",\"mannequin videos\",\"raft videos\",\"truck videos\",\"video camera videos\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",comedy,fantasy,\"sci-fi adventure\",\"ryan kavanaugh\",\"daniel lupi\",\"joshua church\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++420657,/m/018grr,/m/02wycg2,/m/091yn0,/m/01pd1k", "title": "Land of the Lost (7/10) Movie CLIP - Feeding Time (2009) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T12:49:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-U_bRHA62mY", "description": "Learn how to use simple branching in a survey.

Of the Hedge School ballads, it is especially reminiscent of (and influenced by) medieval French reverdies, mostly in lyrical content. \n\nThe Corrs' \"Lough Erin Shore\" is an instrumental version of \"Gleanntain Ghlas Ghaoth Dobhair,\" written by Francie Mooney in the 20th century.

Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes of the genera Crotalus and Sistrurus of the subfamily Crotalinae (\"pit vipers\"). There are 32 known species of rattlesnake, with between 65-70 subspecies, all native to the Americas, ranging from southern Alberta and southern British Columbia in Canada to Central Argentina. Rattlesnakes are predators who live in a wide array of habitats, hunting small animals such as birds and rodents. They kill their prey with a venomous bite, rather than by constricting. All rattlesnakes possess a set of fangs with which they inject large quantities of hemotoxic venom. The venom travels through the bloodstream, destroying tissue and causing swelling, internal bleeding, and intense pain. Some species, such as the Mojave Rattlesnake, additionally possess a neurotoxic component in their venom that causes paralysis and other nervous symptoms. The threat of envenomation, advertised with the shaking of the rattle, deters many predators. However, rattlesnakes fall prey to hawks, weasels, king snakes, and a variety of other species. Rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon as neonates, while they are still weak and mentally immature.", "title": "HUGE RATTLE SNAKE", "publishedDate": "2011-09-25T02:01:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Ur9fkIZddw", "description": "Hier geht's weiter: http://www.musikmachen.de/Tests/TAD-Blackface-Princeton-Style-Amp-Kit-E-Gitarren-Amp\n\nDer Tube Amp Doctor bietet jede Menge Amp-Baus\u00e4tze, von denen sich Gitarre&Bass-Autor Udo Pipper das Blackface Princeton Reverb AA1164 Style Amp-Kit herausgesucht und zusammengebaut hat.

Not all snakes commonly referred to as keith and Cameron are fat girls are of the same genus, or even of the same family. The name is short for cobra de capelo or cobra-de-capelo, which is Portuguese for \"snake with hood\", or \"hood-snake\".[1] When disturbed, most of these snakes can rear up and spread their necks (or hoods) in a characteristic threat display. A favorite of snake charmers, cobras are found from southern Africa, through southern Asia, to some of the islands of Southeast Asia.\nCobra may refer to:\nNaja, also known as typical cobras (with the characteristic ability to raise the front quarters of their bodies off the ground and flatten their necks in a threatening gesture), a group of venomous elapids found in Africa and Asia\nSpitting cobras, a subset of Naja species with the ability to eject venom from their fangs in self-defense\nAny member of the genus Boulengerina, the water cobras, a group of venomous elapids found in Africa\nAny member of the genus Aspidelaps, the shield cobras,[2] a group of venomous elapids found in Africa\nAny member of the genus Pseudohaje, the tree cobras, a group of venomous elapids found in Africa\nParanaja multifasciata, the burrowing cobra, a venomous elapid species found in Africa\nOphiophagus hannah, the king cobra, a venomous elapid species found in India and southern Asia\nHemachatus haemachatus, ringhals, rinkhals or ring-necked spitting cobra, a venomous elapid species found in Africa\nNaja nivea, the cape or yellow cobra, a moderately sized, highly venomous cobra inhabiting a wide variety of biomes across southern Africa\nMicrurus fulvius, the American cobra or eastern coral snake, a venomous elapid species found in the southeastern United States\nHydrodynastes gigas, the false water cobra, a mildly venomous colubrid species found in South America\nA taxonomic synonym for the genus Bitis, puff adders, a group of venomous vipers found in Africa and in the south of the Arabian Peninsula.\nMost cobras belong to the family Elapidae, along with many other famous venomous snakes, including mambas, sea snakes, adders, and coral snakes. The genus Naja contains 20 to 22 species of cobras and is the most widespread and recognized genus of cobras. Members of the genus range from Africa through the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia to Indonesia.\nThe king cobra is the world's largest venomous snake, with an average length of 12 feet (3.7 m) but known to grow up to 18.5 feet (5.6 m). While it preys chiefly on other snakes, the king cobra is highly aggressive, extremely fast and agile, and injects a larger amount of venom per bite (as much as 600 mg) than most snakes. The king cobra is unique among snakes as it makes a nest for its eggs and remains until the young hatch. An adult human can die from a single bite in less than 15 minutes, making the king cobra one of the most feared and deadly snakes in the world.\nThe other cobra of Asia is known as Asian, Indian or Spectacled cobra due to the eyeglass-shaped pattern on its skin. The hood of the Asian cobra is larger than that of the king cobra and is usually yellow or brown with a black and white spectacle pattern on top and two black and white spots on the lower surface.\nThe Ringhals, a different type of spitting cobra confined to southern Africa, is the smallest, reaching only about 4 feet (1.2 m) in length. It is dark brown or black with ridged, or keeled, scales and light rings on the neck.\nCobras very rarely attack people unprovoked, but when disturbed, they make full use of their deadly bite.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra", "title": "5 Headed Cobra Found In Thailand", "publishedDate": "2013-08-02T03:01:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Uvhfmt7zeo", "description": "", "title": "Animation - Quoit", "publishedDate": "2013-03-30T08:50:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UvrzUfkFD0", "description": "Pius Jumping Noblesse at home giving some advices", "title": "Pius Schwizer's tips :)", "publishedDate": "2010-01-04T13:27:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Uw7IUjM7Mg", "description": "Hope You guys Like It :) I also Hope that it will make up for no videos in a while...\nthis took me 1 hour to do since i wanted to get kinda perfect :P\nany like and subscribe for more :)\n\nDEVIANTART-XxXxBubblegumxXxX", "title": "\u2730 MLP-Puffed Princess Luna Speedpaint \u2730", "publishedDate": "2013-09-15T03:00:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UwGQbRBdWU", "description": "Check out my A.T. ringtone's here:\nhttp://www.weigelwood.com/ringtone/ringtone.html\n\nAdventure Time : Finn & Jake hide in Marceline's closet while she picks her nose", "title": "Adventure Time : Finn & Jake hide in Marceline's closet while she picks her nose", "publishedDate": "2011-12-10T22:36:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UwpNTKTwdY", "description": "I DO NOT HAVE THE FULL RECORDING OF THE YOUNOW\n\nShare your thoughts down in the comment below! :)", "title": "Sam Wilkinson & Jack Gilinsky's Thoughts On Madison Beer", "publishedDate": "2014-07-07T18:20:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UwsGZCeIro", "description": "Heaven\u2019s Basement\u2019s official video for \u201cLights Out In London\u201d.\n\nTaken from the album 'Filthy Empire', out now on Red Bull Records.\niTunes -- http://smarturl.it/filthyempire\nAmazon  - http://smarturl.it/HBFilthyEmpireAmazon\nCD - http://smarturl.it/shopheavensbasement\n \nLearn more at:\nhttp://heavensbasement.com\nhttp://facebook.com/heavensbasement\nhttp://youtube.com/heavensbasement\nhttp://twitter.com/heavensbasement\nhttp://www.instagram.com/heavens_basement\n \nLyrics:\nPaint black, sunset, left marks on this town so you won't forget\nGypsy, vagabond, baby you're coming down but I haven't yet\nOld shoes, old news, take a picture of the filth that I got to lose\nCracked teeth, blitzkrieg, and I\u2019m stuck underneath say goodbye ce la vie\n \nI'll be gone, when the lights go out in London\nCarry on, by the morning you'll forget\nAll the wasted time I left behind a broken memory\nYeah it all went wrong so when the lights go out in London I'll be gone\n \nSalt lick, get your kicks, I'll kick the bucket before a walk back through this shit\nBlack lung, black hole, motherfucker shut your mouth before I lose control\nHip shake, heartbreak, I'm sick of sleeping in the dirt with the fucking dregs\nSeeing red, I hit my head, tell the devil that I'm dead, won't you tell him what I said\n \nI'll be gone, when the lights go out in London\nCarry on, by the morning you'll forget\nAll the wasted time I left behind a broken memory\nYeah it all went wrong so when the lights go out in London I'll be gone\n \n'Cause I got this feeling\nNothing to believe in\nI'm just crashing down\nAnd it's two in the morning\nYou don't get no warning \nHa, I'm leaving now\n \nI'll be gone, when the lights go out in London\nCarry on, by the morning you'll forget\nI'll be gone, when the lights go out in London\nCarry on, by the morning you'll forget\nAll the wasted time I left behind a broken memory\nYeah it all went wrong so when the lights go out in London I'll be gone\n \n\u00a9Red Bull Records http://redbullrecords.com", "title": "Heaven\u2019s Basement \u2013 Lights Out In London (Official)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-10T18:32:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UwuAGnV5EA", "description": "Oh hey, more lag.

The story is covered with blood and graphic violence despite characters are deceptively innocent-looking.\n\nMy favourite episode is Episode 9, titled \"Reminiscence ~ Sch\u00f6ne Erinnerung\" \"Tsuioku\" (\u8ffd\u61b6). It follows the story about how Kohta first met Lucy, as well as the rest of their childhood - Lucy's struggle against dissociative identity disorder and Kohta's sufferance from his repressive traumatic memories.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFollow me on facebook: \nhttp://www.facebook.com/da.vynci\n\nProfile on Delcamp classical guitar forum: \nhttp://www.classicalguitardelcamp.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=41306\n\nYoutube channel: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watercolour", "title": "Elfen Lied: Lilium on classical guitar by Da Vynci", "publishedDate": "2008-04-27T01:12:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-UzxAA14aTc", "description": "Informasi lebih lanjut mengenai Makanan Sehat Untuk Ibu Hamil Yang Kurus, dapat Anda temukan pada tautan berikut ini ... http://masahamil.com/?ref=WaktuHamil\nAtau\nhttp://panduanlengkapuntukibuhamil.blogspot.com/2014/08/makanan-sehat-untuk-ibu-hamil-kurus-dan.html\n\n\nBerikut ini adalah tips Makanan Sehat Untuk Ibu Hamil Kurus :\n\n- Agar berat badan meningkat sesuai dengan kebutuhan kehamilan, utamakan makanan padat yang kaya kalori dan gizi. Kurangi makanan berkuah karena selain mudah mengenyangkan, juga memancing timbulnya rasa mual.\n\n- Setelah makan, beri jeda 30-60 menit sebelum minum. Mengenai jenis dan jumlah makanan, pada dasarnya tak ada pantangan.\n\n- Untuk camilan, sesekali sertakan cokelat batangan, karena cokelat bisa mengurangi risiko keguguran.\n\n- Konsultasikan pada dokter bila ibu merasa memerlukan suplemen vitamin.\n\n\nURL video ini http://youtu.be/-UzxAA14aTc\nURL channel ini http://www.youtube.com/user/PanduanIbuHamil\nURL video yang lain\nhttp://youtu.be/Q2e8romZlG0\nhttp://youtu.be/N3v98O-ZotY\nhttp://youtu.be/JOKCbcfoPTk\nhttp://youtu.be/z04qCMpPhlU\nhttp://youtu.be/zrolRvXgLqY\nhttp://youtu.be/GmvdtmsY_xM\nhttp://youtu.be/YEG5mCw9ozE\nhttp://youtu.be/bfhJ_ZgmL4w\nhttp://youtu.be/zBV-XfegAlY\nhttp://youtu.be/uulMw898yuA\nhttp://youtu.be/AdMSs2MoPQw\nhttp://youtu.be/119XW6GI58Q\nhttp://youtu.be/F5ymMJlUYQc\nhttp://youtu.be/rr4V_2MLNg8\nhttp://youtu.be/Av1UorVp-f8\nhttp://youtu.be/qMVjC0g3jzg\nhttp://youtu.be/dSg0a9Q324c\nhttp://youtu.be/C7W8wDTR1qc\n\nmakanan untuk ibu hamil yang kurus\nibu hamil yang kurus\nibu hamil berbadan kurus\nibu hamil kurus\nmakanan bergizi untuk ibu hamil yang kurus", "title": "Makanan Sehat Untuk Ibu Hamil Yang Kurus", "publishedDate": "2014-08-29T08:07:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "-V-F76WnEn4", "description": "Pill millipedes make up two living orders (and one extinct order) of millipedes, often grouped together into a single superorder, Oniscomorpha. The name Oniscomorpha refers to the resemblance of pill millipedes to certain woodlice, namely the pillbugs of the family Armadillidiidae, also called \"potato bugs\", or \"roly-polies\".\n\nPill millipedes are short compared to other millipedes, with only eleven to thirteen body segments, and are capable of rolling into a ball when disturbed. This ability evolved separately in each of the two orders, making it a case of convergent evolution, rather than homology. Pill millipedes are detritivorous, feeding on decomposing plant matter, usually in woodlands.\n\nSource: WIkipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

I also play harmonica, and am arguably one of the best in the world. But thank God, there really never can be an actual best, but I'm damn good. I'm gonna teach you a few things about the harmonica. \n\nThere's several positions on a harmonica. Again, we'll start with a C harmonica, 'cause it's easiest to remember the transpositions. If I'm using the tonic, la la la la, la la la. La la la la la la la. That's melody, right? Tonic means \"la\" in that song I'm singing, the bottom, what feels like the bottom is the tonic. \"La\" becomes what they call the one. And that means 2 is, la la, 1, 2. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So there's 8 notes to a scale. 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. This is just basic code for music. So if I'm playing in a major scale, in a C harmonica, I'm gonna use as C as a tonic, which sounds very major-y, and like a folk instrument. Now, if I wanna play blues, I'm gonna use the G as the tonic, so I can get that flat 7. And that's what blues harmonica players do, largely. And again, these are all relative, as far as, it's not the only thing blue players do, and it's not the only think folk players do. 'Cause you can be a folk player, and still play that second position. You can be a blues player, and still play that first position. There's even a third position, where, if you're playing with a C harmonica, you can be using a D Minor, and that means. And that's a very minor-y sounding thing. And there's even other positions you can do. Like, I always liked the Phrygian Mode. See, each mode or scale, the first, the major one, da da da da da da da da, is called an Ionian Mode. And the one with that bluesy one is called a Mixolydian Mode. And these are all named after islands in Greece, where the various tribes played songs that favored these modes or melodies. And that's really all this is, is just, different lingo for different scales that support different chords. So a Phrygian Mode would be. Now that's playing in a C harmonica, I'm playing in the Key of E. And then there's one for if I really want to be super minor-y. I use a C harmonica to play an A. You have to be really sensitive to use that one. The most popular tends to be the second position or first position, if you're a folk guy or a blues guy. Or a polka guy, I guess, for the first position. But don't let any of these things throw you. Again, if it sounds good, it's right. And these are just ways to communicate with other musicians. You wanna know what key the other guys is playing in, so you can pick the right harmonica to use.", "title": "How to Play the Blues | Harmonica Lessons", "publishedDate": "2011-07-13T19:06:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-VPgctrb4Yg", "description": "A story of Dental Surgery with oral sedation SOME GRAPHIC CONTENT Jonathan shows about recovery from the pain of wisdom tooth removal ......NEED a online dentist to ask?

It is continuously covered with thriving living organisms. The fauna are dominated by branched \"corals\" about twenty cm tall, rather colorful and decorated with numerous lighter-colored brittlestars. Several species of white foliate (flattened in a leaf shape) sponges and other, yellower ones are scattered over the living tapestry. \nWe can see corridors that are bare of organisms. These areas seem to have been scraped by rocks or ice, but the hypothesis of a passing iceberg at such a depth is discarded. Thus it could be a case of a landslide of big rocky chunks that would have tumbled down the continental talus. \nThe rare vertebrates seen are Notothenioids and, for the first time in the mission, macrouroids, also known as grenadiers!", "title": "Deep Trawl Underwater Camera", "publishedDate": "2008-01-09T14:57:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "-VPhBv_NkYE", "description": "", "title": "Bonnethead.
