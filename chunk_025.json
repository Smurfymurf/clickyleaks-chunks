The high water mark data is provided by FEMA. Both data sets are of 1 meter resolution. The highlighted models were developed in 3D Studio and placed in the scene via elevation processing of the LIDAR data. Overall, the application reflects the volume of water during Hurricane Katrina and how it affected the Biloxi coastline.\n\n\nDescription of the CAVE program:\nThis visualization illustrates the extent of the flood waters produced by Hurricane Katrina upon the coastal topography of Biloxi. The topography data was produced and obtained from the US Army Corps of Engineers. The water data was collected by FEMA and is not dependent on time; the simulation is merely animating the data from \"no water\" to its proper height to fully depict the massive amount of water flow.\n\nTopography:\nThis data has a spatial point resolution of 1 meter (roughly 3 feet). The data was produced via LIDAR (LIght Detection and Ranging); elevation points are derived by the measurement of the return of a laser from an aircraft. Spikes in the data refer to stoplights, lampposts, trees, signs, etc.\n\nFlood Data:\nFEMA collected the high water mark data from debris lines days after Hurricane Katrina landed on the coast. This data is of a resolution of 30 meters (roughly 100 feet) in between data points. \n\nBuildings:\nCHL constructed building model whose dimensions were derived from the LIDAR topography data set, Degital photography of the actual buildings were placed on the building models to obtain an accurate depiction.\n\n\nCenter of Higher Learning\nVisualization Center\nBldg. 1103, Room 103\nStennis Space Center, MS 39529\nhttp://www.chl.state.ms.us\nhttp://www.hpvc.chl.state.ms.us", "title": "Visualization of Biloxi and the Effects of Hurricane Katrina Flood Waters - CHL", "publishedDate": "2010-12-15T16:03:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "0WExNgQKzsU", "description": "Hey guys, sorry for my bad english (I'm from Uruguay) & the little incoordination between the video and the sound, just tryin' it.

Radio Edit\n\nVideo directed by Pavel Khvaleev.\n\nhttp://www.moonbeamonline.net\nhttp://www.facebook.com/MoonbeamRU\nhttp://twitter.com/MoonbeamRU\n\nMoonbeam present their new single \"You Win Me\". The vocals are performed by Aelyn and it's worth mentioning that this is also the 500th milestone single release on the Black Hole imprint.\n\nWe previously heard from Moonbeam when the guys released their new single \"Only You\" with vocalist Jacob A. The Russian brothers Pavel and Vitaly Khavleev can count themselves amongst the biggest music exponents of Russian dance music. The release of their reputation defining first album \"Around The World\" harvested the hit singles \"Song For A Girl\", \"Breathless\" and \"Look Around\". They released their debut mix compilation \"Space Odyssey\" on Black Hole Recordings and it was Ti\u00ebsto who reserved Moonbeam's 2007 single \"See The Difference Inside\" for his acclaimed \"In Search Of Sunrise 6, Ibiza\". He later on did the same with Moonbeam's remix of Rachael Star's \"To Forever\" on the 7th, Asia themed part of the series. Moonbeam's 2011 album \"The Secret\" was one of their many releases on their own label Moonbeam Digital.\n\nThe first version of \"You Win Me\" comes in the Original Soundtrack Mix, as was the case with their previous single. It truly offers a new sound from the Moonbeam studios and indeed sports a filmic atmosphere that embraces you like a warm blanket. For the clubs, the Khavleev brothers once again delivered a Club Mix that will fit perfectly on every DJ's track list; especially for ISOS style- or intimate late night club sets.

The width of the frame is adapted by the spreader system to the desired trench width.\nA right to right angles.\n\nThe mobile frame accurately ensures right angles in the trench.

This exercise is very important for most pregnant women to do.  As always you should first check with your doctor to make sure that any new exercise it is safe for you to do. \nStart off on hands and knees with the back as flat as possible.  Then imagine you are pulling your belly button toward the spine.  This will help to activate your abdominal muscles while keeping your spine in a neutral position.  Avoid arching the back upward or letting it fall downward.  Then tilt the pelvis as though you are bringing your tailbone toward your chin.  Then return to a neutral position and repeat.  This exercise will both help strengthen your abdominals as well as help stretch your lower back.\n You should not have pain with this exercise.  If you do, discontinue the exercise and talk with your doctor.\n I help many pregnant women have healthier, less painful pregnancies, labors, and deliveries.  It is extremely important for pregnant women to stay active and fit throughout their pregnancy.  As the center of gravity changes with the growing belly, the future mother will have altered her posture.  The pelvis will rock forward, the upper back will lean backward, and the head will come forward.  This altered posture leads to an increase in the curve in the lower back which jams the joints together and leads to low back pain.  But this does not have to be severe for many pregnant women.  Prenatal exercise is a must for a healthy pregnancy!\nThe pelvic rock exercise helps to strengthen the abdomen, pelvic floor as well as the low back.  Therefore, it is easier for the future mom to use good posture and decrease back pain.  It will also help her prepare for labor and delivery.  Please  check with your doctor to determine that this exercise is safe for you.  Then I recommend doing this exercise daily.  Start as early on during the pregnancy as possible. I recommend doing the exercise 25 times per day when you first start out.  After a week or two, increase up to 25 times, twice per day and then eventually work your way up to 40 times twice per day.   \nThis was brought to you by Dr. Katie Sleigh, your pregnancy and pediatric health care advocate.

It will help in chronic kidney disease also known as CKD. When a CKD diet is implemented within your renal disease treatment plan you will fare much better than if you did no diet approach at all. \n\nWhy it is crucial to have a chronic kidney disease diet. You must understand that the \nkidneys regulate many bodily functions including blood pressure, making hormones, making urine (technically extracting water from the blood) and regulating minerals in the body. If there is any kind of renal insufficiency the minerals must be regulated through a ckd diet, also referred to as a renal disease diet. \n\nWhen you use the proper medical care and a proper diet with ckd - chronic kidney disease you will have a complete treatment plan which will improve your outcome of avoiding dialysis and kidney failure considerably. You can even live the rest of your life feeling good with a good properly balanced renal disease diet for any sort of damage that is there to the kidneys. For example, if you have diabetes induced kidney damage known as diabetic nephropathy these 3 foods in the video will help boost your renal health. If you have PKD, also known as poly cystic kidney disease this ckd diet will help you. If you IgA nephropathy renal disease diet can certainly help you. \nAfter finishing this video watch some other videos about kidney disease and ways you can begin improving your kidney health.\n\nVisit http://www.healkidneydisease.com\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WejOQ-aCX0", "title": "Renal Disease Diet Foods For CKD Treatment \"3 CKD Diet Tips\"", "publishedDate": "2013-08-31T04:53:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "0WfJC6rFSIU", "description": "just picked up this frame with motor, but the motor was blown so i bought one from harbor freight,running 30w for break in then switching to 10w-30 syn,", "title": "Predator 212cc (mini bike build)", "publishedDate": "2012-07-09T01:19:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "0WfOC-uaRbU", "description": "klaverakk", "title": "Snemand Frost og fr\u00f8ken T\u00f8 - Vagn Skovlund", "publishedDate": "2014-05-03T13:44:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "0WgNNYZRlqg", "description": "OUR HONEYMOON", "title": "GALAPAGOS.mov", "publishedDate": "2012-04-06T05:23:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "0WgcET110sI", "description": "I figured I'd upload all of the major fights.\nI'm not the best player, so don't rag on me for it.\n\nThis is the first fight against Sir \"Knuckles\" Gawain.\n\nGame: Sonic and the Black Knight\nSystem: Nintendo Wii\nPlayer: Miakaylia", "title": "Sonic and the Black Knight - [Sonic vs Sir Gawain]", "publishedDate": "2009-03-19T23:32:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "0WgenwfYmwk", "description": "The so-called \"one-drop rule\" was enacted into American state laws in the early 20th century. The idea was that anyone with any amount of African ancestry, even just \"one drop of blood,\" would be legally deemed to be black. Furthermore, interracial marriage was widely thought to be so bad that laws criminalizing it were in the books in 30 states until the mid-20th century and after this movie was made.\n\nConsider what life was like for the people who were represented by the characters in this scene. In that time period, many white men were disgusted by interracial relationships. Thus, not only did mulatto people have to worry about discrimination in general because of things like the one-drop rule, but women of mixed race who were \"passable\" as white had to fear for their lives when dealing with white men. The movie Imitation of Life might be called a \"melodrama,\" but it portrays an unfortunate reality of mid-20th century life. We may have come to the point where interracial relationships are no longer controversial, but no one ever thinks, let alone talks, about the real-life cases of violent altercations that occurred when bigoted men learned that their girlfriends or wives were legally black. Nowadays, people's notion of the historical controversies over interracial relationships extends no further than imagining that the racists of the past were merely disapproving.\n\nLet's not forget the things like this that actually happened.", "title": "Harrowing scene from Imitation of Life", "publishedDate": "2013-11-29T09:15:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "0WgrRlzjW1M", "description": "DP Agri have become the sole importers for the Dutch Company Flingk who make specialist bedders for Sand, Sawdust, and all forms of Compost and Green Bedding.Flingk are the first company to devise a bedder to apply lime through a separate hopper before sawdust is applied to the cubicle space.This sterilises the cubicle yet the sawbust protects the udder from the effects of the lime and is the perfect answer to sawdust application.There is a machine for every application including a smaller manual machine for robotic milking systems please ring us for full prices and details.", "title": "FlingK Bedder", "publishedDate": "2013-11-15T10:55:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "0WgweoXHqPE", "description": "Ivan Couzens and his daughter Vicki are Gunditjmara people from the western district of Victoria.

Sejak di bangku kuliah, isteri dari Ari Sulistyo (29) tersebut sudah mulai mengembangkan hobinya sejak kecil, yaitu mengkreasi kerajinan tangan (handmade) menjadi sebuah bisnis kreatif yang mampu mendatangkan keuntungan. Dengan mengusung 'ammi&abi' sebagai nama usahanya, saat ini Sari mampu mengkreasi ratusan jenis produk handmade di rumahnya Sidoarum Sleman. Handmade yang dihasilkan 'ammi&abi' berbahan baku kain perca, sehingga Sari menamai produknya dengan sebutan sulam perca.Dalam menjalankan bisnis kreatif nya, ammi&abi melakukan pemasaran online dengan blog.\n\nDitemui tim liputan bisnisUKM di rumahnya Rabu (21/12), Sari berujar jika pada mulanya dirinya membuat produk bisnis kreatif tersebut untuk dikenakan sendiri. \"Ketika itu memang hanya untuk dipakai sendiri, kemudian banyak teman-teman kampus yang tertarik, alhasil mulai kepikiran untuk mengembangkan hal itu menjadi sebuah usaha serius tahun 2008, meskipun belum memakai brand sama sekali,\" jelas alumni Fakultas Kehutanan UGM 2004 tersebut. Setelah memutuskan untuk menikah, Sari mulai memperkenalkan 'ammi&abi' sebagai brand kerajinan tangan sulam perca kreasinya tahun 2010.\n\n\"Filosofinya sederhana, ammi&abi artinya Bapak dan Ibu, jadi kita berusaha untuk membuat kreasi produk itu dengan hati, seperti Bapak dan Ibu yang selalu memberikan yang terbaik untuk keluarganya,\" jelas Sari tentang penggunaan nama 'ammi&abi'. Handmade with love kemudian dipilih Sari sebagai slogan/ jargon yang selalu mengiringi produk kreasi 'ammi&abi'. Selain itu, pemilihan nama tersebut juga didasari atas cakupan konsumen 'ammi&abi' yang luas, yaitu seluruh anggota keluarga, bisa dari anak-anak, remaja, dewasa, hingga orang tua.\n\nInformasi lengkap mengenai liputan bisa anda daptkan di :\nhttp://bisnisukm.com/memproduksi-aneka-kreasi-handmade-kain-perca.html\n\nhttp://youtu.be/0Wm-bZhwdq4", "title": "Kreasi Handmade Kain Perca, Sukses Dengan Pemasaran Online", "publishedDate": "2011-12-24T04:02:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Wm8PyCw4do", "description": "Powered by http://www.eurovision.tv.

From its first scene, in which an unmarried couple balances pleasure and guilt in a lunchtime liaison in a cheap hotel (hardly a common moment in a major studio film in 1960), Psycho announced that it was taking the audience to places it had never been before, and on that score what followed would hardly disappoint. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is unhappy in her job at a Phoenix, Arizona real estate office and frustrated in her romance with hardware store manager Sam Loomis (John Gavin). One afternoon, Marion is given $40,000 in cash to be deposited in the bank. Minutes later, impulse has taken over and Marion takes off with the cash, hoping to leave Phoenix for good and start a new life with her purloined nest egg. 36 hours later, paranoia and exhaustion have started to set in, and Marion decides to stop for the night at the Bates Motel, where nervous but personable innkeeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) cheerfully mentions that she's the first guest in weeks, before he regales her with curious stories about his mother. There's hardly a film fan alive who doesn't know what happens next, but while the shower scene is justifiably the film's most famous sequence, there are dozens of memorable bits throughout this film. The first of a handful of sequels followed in 1983, while Gus Van Sant's controversial remake, starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche, appeared in 1998.\n\npsycho,\"psycho clip\",psychosocial,\"psychosocial baby\",\"psychosocial slipknot\",\"psycho killer\",psychostick,\"psycho realm\",\"psycho girlfriend\",\"psychopathic rydas\",\"psycho puddle of mudd\",\"janet leigh\",\"anthony perkins\",\"shower curtain videos\",\"classic horror movies\",classics,\"slashers and serial killers\",\"alfred hitchcock\",\"aggression videos\",\"life and death videos\",\"bathroom videos\",\"norman bates\",\"marion crane\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++39578,/m/016dgz,/m/01hkck", "title": "The Shower - Psycho (5/12) Movie CLIP (1960) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T13:43:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "0WtnTaceqRM", "description": "", "title": "yellow bellied sapsuckers making some noise", "publishedDate": "2012-04-30T02:47:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Wu5ooS5eDs", "description": "In this episode of Catch It In Time ATQ, we asked Dr. Raymond Mencini of Centura St. Anthony Breast Center in Lakewood, CO what he thought was the most important breakthrough in breast cancer screening technology.

A change of pace dribble is used when the player is pushing the ball up the court to make the defender think that they're going full speed. And then you'll hesitate and change your pace to then explode by them. A lot of times what happens is the defender, they get relaxed. When you're going full speed and then you slow up to change your pace, a defender will raise up and relax and then you catch them off guard by going full speed.\n\nSo right now we'll walk through a drill with Jerry and George where they'll go to the baseline. And we'll start off showing with change of pace dribble going in one direction, or going in the same direction. So right now they'll start off with their right hand on the baseline and they'll go to half court. You'll notice that what we want to do is as we push this ball up the court, we want to stay low and control the ball up to our waist level. When we change pace that means that we're going to hesitate for a second, get that defender leaning, and then explode off of that push off. So it's full speed, slow up to change your pace and then you want to accelerate and explode off of that push off.\n\nSo right now George will go up the court first. Here we go. He'll take two dribbles. He hesitates and then he explodes. Hesitates and explodes. So now as George comes back with his left hand, Jerry will go down the court with his right. Here we go, fellas. Good. Two dribbles, hesitate, explode, hesitate, explode. And then we'll wait for Jerry to come back. Hesitate, explode, hesitate, explode.\n\nNow, the next thing that we can work on is changing direction off of our change of pace. Meaning that we get the defender leaning one direction off of this change of pace hesitation, we cross overlook. So this will look like this. And I'll walk through it slowly, where I'll push the ball out, I'll change of pace, hesitate and then I cross over low to explode. I'll show it from this angle. As I'm coming back, I'm dribbling full speed, hesitate, change of pace and cross over. Here we go. So push it out, change, very good, change, nice job. Now they'll both go at the same time. Here we go. Full speed, accelerate, change, accelerate, change. Alright? So now Jerry will push it out, change, change.\n\nSo those are a few ways that you can use a change of pace dribble going in the same direction and changing direction. That's how you use a change of pace dribble.", "title": "How to Do a Change-of-Pace Dribble | Basketball Moves", "publishedDate": "2013-10-03T20:55:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "0WxDrVUrSvI", "description": "Lily Allen's brand new track \"Hard Out Here\" is available to download on iTunes now here: http://smarturl.it/HardOutHere?IQid=vevoyt \nWatch the video here: http://smarturl.it/HardOutHereVideo?IQid=vevoyt \n\nAlso out now is \"Somewhere Only We Know\" as featured in the TV Advert here! http://smarturl.it/lilysowk?IQid=vevoyt \n\nFollow Lily online:\n\nhttp://www.lilyallenmusic.com\nhttps://twitter.com/LilyAllen\nhttps://www.facebook.com/lilyallen\nhttp://instagram.com/lilyallen\nhttp://lilyallenmusic.tumblr.com\nhttps://plus.google.com/+lilyallen", "title": "Lily Allen - Smile", "publishedDate": "2008-11-27T18:06:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "0WxfMl1MkjI", "description": "Koyote - Disturbance(Paran), \ucf54\uc694\ud0dc - \ud30c\ub780, Music Camp(\uc74c\uc545\ucea0\ud504), 88\ud68c, EP88, 2001/02/24, MBC TV, Republic of Korea", "title": "Koyote - Disturbance(Paran), \ucf54\uc694\ud0dc - \ud30c\ub780, Music Camp 20010224", "publishedDate": "2012-04-18T06:53:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Wxo4gZwLD0", "description": "Guaco, \u00e9 uma planta medicinal, com efeito broncodilatador e expectorante.

His parents were both educated in Austria at the University of Vienna and both subsequently became educators. His father was a historian and an ethnographer, while his mother was an accomplished chemist. Although his parents did not have special musical training, his mother played piano and his father played the violin. Their son, young Myroslav, was exposed to music in the household from an early age and took a particular liking to it. Although his parents influenced Myroslav's early interest in music, no less important was the fact that in his family was a very famous diva of the 20th century -- Myroslav Skoryk's great aunt was the famous Ukrainian soprano Solomiya Krushelnytska.\nIn 1939 Lviv was forcefully occupied by the Soviet Union as part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Under the new Soviet regime many Ukrainian intellectuals were persecuted, including the Skoryk family which lost a number of members. In 1940 Lviv was occupied by the Nazis. During the Nazi occupation Skoryk's family vented their opposition to the previous Soviet regime. With the return of Soviet forces towards the end of World War II, Skoryk's family were deported to Siberia, and this is where Myroslav grew up. Myroslav's older brother enlisted in the Galicia division ended up in Rimini at the end of the War and emigrated to Australia.\nSkoryk graduated from the Moscow Conservatory in 1964 and took a teaching job at the Lviv Conservatory where he remained until 1966. Shortly after, he accepted a position at the Kiev Conservatory where he said, \"Along with teaching composition classes, I also lectured theory classes that focused on contemporary harmony techniques.\" The subject of Skoryk's dissertation, which he completed in 1964, concentrated on Prokofiev's music, its title reads \"Osoblyvosti ladu muzyky S. Prokofieva\" (The Model System of Prokofiev). Skoryk also wrote a book, \"Struktura i vyrazhalna pryroda akordyky v muzitsi XX stolittia\" (The Structural Aspects of Chords in 20th Century Music) (Kiev, 1983 Musical Ukraine Publishing House) as

The etiology of seborrheic dermatitis appears to be on the basis of a host response to an overgrowth of a normal skin yeast, Pityrosporum ovale. Seborrheic dermatitis occurs in oilier areas of the skin. Some central nervous system abnormalities such as Parkinson's disease appear to result in increased skin oiliness with increased seborrheic dermatitis. Patients with AIDS can have more severe seborrheic dermatitis. The scaling of the scalp is also termed dandruff.\nTreatment:\n\nRemoval of the yeast is highly effective. Zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, and ketoconazole shampoos are highly effective.\nBecause the yeast is a normal skin organism, cessation of therapy generally results in a recurrence of the problem.

Like the black widow species in the United States, L. geometricus has a prominent hourglass-shaped marking on the underside of the abdomen; the brown widow's hourglass, however, is usually a vivid orange or a yellowish color. Unlike the black widow, L. geometricus has a black-and-white geometric pattern on the dorsal side of its abdomen. Although the Latin name comes from this pattern, a spider's coloring can and does darken over time and the pattern may become obscured. Also, they have stripes on their legs. Brown widows are often preyed on by mud daubers and sometimes by digger wasps.\n\n\n \n\n\n A brown widow's egg sac\nBrown widows can be located by finding their egg sacs, which are easily identifiable. They resemble a sandspur, having pointed projections all over,[4] and they are sometimes described as \"tufted\", \"fluffy\",[4] or \"spiky\" in appearance. Eggs hatch in approximately 20 days.[7] Female brown widows \"lay about 120-150 eggs per sac and can make 20 egg sacs over a lifetime.\"[1]\n\nLike all Latrodectus species, L. geometricus has a neurotoxic venom that, drop for drop, is as toxic as the black widow's. However, brown widow bites are usually not very dangerous; usually much less dangerous than the black widow's.[3] The effects of the toxin are usually confined to the bite area and surrounding tissue, unlike the black widow's.[4] Mere toxicity of the venom is not the only factor in dangerousness. Brown widow bites are minor compared to black widow bites, because they cannot deliver the same amount of venom as the black widow.[1] The LD-50 of L. geometricus venom has been measured in mice as 0.43 mg/kg.,[8] and separately again as 0.43 mg/kg (with a confidence interval of 0.31-0.53).[9]\n\nSimilar widows include the L. rhodesiensis, a brown-colored relative of L. geometricus which is native to Zimbabwe. Both species are collectively known as brown button spiders throughout southern Africa. Brown button spiders are known to have a lifespan of about two years.[", "title": "Spider brown widow (Latrodectus geometricus)", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T20:06:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "0XZeEy88PXI", "description": "8 scientists spend 11 days on top of Nyiragongo in September 2011.\nPartners : The Royal Museum for Central Africa (Belgium)/ The National Museum of Natural History (Luxembourg) / The European Center for Geodynamics & Seismology (Luxembourg)", "title": "Expedition to the Nyiragongo lava lake (North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo)", "publishedDate": "2012-01-19T15:20:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "0XZwqQAqCA0", "description": "", "title": "How-To Grow Catha Edulis", "publishedDate": "2014-10-18T14:13:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "0XZzglak-q4", "description": "Freddie Mercury doing a piano cover of the famous song written by  Stephen Sondheim.The track originates from a tape that Jim Hutton(Freddie's last lover) recorded...it was recorded somewhere around 1985/1986.", "title": "Freddie Mercury - Send in the clowns RARE!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-07-16T13:47:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "0X_2rFsRq1c", "description": "This is me getting a TB test.

Please visit our site for more information about dermatological conditions. \n\n Key Points\n\n* Better known as shingles\n* Painful skin rash that often forms blisters\n* Occurs in a dermatome(sensory nerve distribution) on one side of the body...does not      cross the midline\n* Viral in nature, caused by the chicken pox virus (varicella-zoster virus=VZV)\n\nHerpes Zoster, often known as shingles, is a frequently painful skin rash localized to one region of the body.   The herpes zoster virus (VZV) is the same virus that causes chicken pox (varicella). Once an outbreak of chicken pox has resolved, the virus becomes dormant in the sensory nerve root along the spinal cord.  The area where it remains dormant is called the dorsal root ganglion.  Later in life, the virus may reactivate and travel along the nerve, often causing severe pain and in a region of the body.  Because individual sensory nerves are responsible for sensation in one region on one side of the body, the associated pain and eventual blisters are confined to that region.  The resulting skin rash \u2014 which is often accompanied by clear or bloody blisters \u2014 occurs most often in people over the age of 60, although certain diseases like AIDS or cancer can suppress the immune system enough so that the herpes zoster virus can reactivate.  Aging, illness or stress to the body or mind may tigger herpes zoster.  \n\nPatients with zoster are contagious and should avoid immunosuppressed people, pregnant women, and people that have not had chicken pox.  Once all of the sores from a zoster outbreak have scabbed, the patient is no longer contagious.  \n\nHerpes zoster ophthalmicus occurs when VZV infects the first branch of the trigeminal nerve, V1.  This nerve innervates the forehead, nose and eye.  Infection of this region can lead to severe eye pain, conjunctivitis, and vision loss.  Hutchinson's sign describes blister involvement of the nasal tip, sidewall or nasal root.  The presence of this sign is a predictor of more severe ocular involvement with likelihood of a worse outcome concerning vision loss and disease severity.  \n\nHerpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt Syndrome) describes VZV affecting the V3 branch of the trigeminal nerve.  This nerve innervates the ear and lower jaw line.  Complications of infection in this region include: blistering rash, severe ear pain, hearing loss, and paralysis of the facial nerve.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis (Other conditions with similar appearance)Conjunctivitis\n\nCoxsackievirus\nSuperficial pyoderma\n\nDiagnosis\n\nKey Points\n\n*Starts as a tingling or burning localized pain\n* Rash appears 2-3 days later\n* Blisters break and form crusts\n*Rash is almost always unilateral, with the blisters only on one side of the body, thus not   crossing the \"midline\" of the body.  The severely immunosuppressed are an exception     and are at risk for disseminated (widespread) herpes zoster\n\nHerpes zoster usually begins as a one-sided tingling or burning pain, which may actually become quite severe before the rash appears. When this occurs on the left side of the chest, it is sometimes mistaken for a heart attack.  Red patches will subsequently form two to three days later, often with blisters (initially, it looks like hives). Once the blisters break, ulcers dry out and form crusts, which normally fall off in two to three weeks. The rash usually occurs anywhere from the spine to the front of the belly, though it can involve the face, mouth, eyes, or ears. Additional symptoms may include abdominal pain, chills, fever, joint pain, taste and vision problems, headaches or even loss of eye motion or a drooping eye. Forehead or eyelid involvement especially with nasal tip blisters warrants immediate therapy and evaluation by ophthalmology.\n\nOnce the rash has appeared, a dermatologist can recognize herpes zoster by sight. Lab tests can confirm the diagnosis.\n\nTreatment\n\nBecause shingles usually resolves itself, treatment is not absolutely required, but early treatment may reduce the likelihood of long term pain.  Pain is uncommon once the rash has disappeared for people under age 50. However, the older the patient, the more severe the outbreak and the longer the delay in therapy, all increase the risk of post herpetic neuralgia.  Over the counter analgesics or topical lotions with calamine are usually sufficient for mild pain.  Early use of antiviral drugs may reduce the severity and duration of shingles and, importantly, decrease the risk of chronic pain in the region (post herpetic neuralgia).  One in five sufferers of shingles will develop post-herpetic neuralgia, a pain in the area that could last for months or years, which results from damage to the nerves.", "title": "Shingles (Herpes Zoster) Treatment Options - OnlineDermClinic", "publishedDate": "2012-03-19T21:30:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "0XhwQUqm_Hw", "description": "Subscribe to SaturdayNightLive: http://j.mp/1bjU39d\nClassroom: http://j.mp/HgfVo9\nSEASON 37: http://j.mp/1e9Lb42\nCrack Ups: http://j.mp/HgfV7M\n\nA high school prom is marred by announcements from Principal Frye and an intoxicated teacher with a bombshell.

Die zu den Rosengew\u00e4chsen geh\u00f6rende Pflan-ze sollte in keinem Nutzgarten fehlen. Die beste Pflanzzeit ist Anfang August. Lasst zwischen den einzelnen Pflanzen etwa drei\u00dfig Zentimeter Abstand.\n \nDie richtige Pflanzh\u00f6he entscheidet \u00fcber einen guten Anwuchs. Das Wachstumszentrum, also das \u201eHerz\" der Erdbeerpflanze sollte knapp \u00fcber dem Boden und keinesfalls von Erde bedeckt sein. \nErdbeeren lieben einen sonnigen Standort. Am besten stehen sie im Bereich von anderen Kulturpflanzen, nicht jedoch direkt an Rasen- oder Wiesenfl\u00e4chen, da die Schnecken sonst nur einen kurzen Weg zu den Fr\u00fcchten haben. \n\nIm Vorfr\u00fchling solltet ihr eure Erdbeeren am Besten mit Stallmist oder Kompost d\u00fcngen und gew\u00e4hrleisten, dass der Boden locker und leicht sauer ist. Erdbeeren sind durstige Pflanzen. Vor allem in der trockenen Sommerzeit sollten sie regelm\u00e4\u00dfig gut gew\u00e4ssert werden. Wenn die Pfl\u00e4nzchen die ersten Bl\u00fcten angesetzt haben, emp-fiehlt es sich, Stroh auszubringen. Sp\u00e4ter reifen die Fr\u00fcchte auf diesem Strohbett und nicht auf der Erde. Zudem erschwert das Stroh Schnecken den Zugang. \n\nUm Bodenm\u00fcdigkeit zu vermeiden, solltet ihr nach dem Abernten eine so genannte Anbaupause einlegen. Das bedeutet, dass zwei bis drei Jahre keine Erdbeeren auf dem Beet wachsen sollten. Da in Haus- und Kleing\u00e4rten die Pflanzen im ersten Jahr h\u00e4ufig jedoch noch nicht das Maximum ihres Wachstums erreicht haben, solltet ihr eure Erdbeeren erst nach zwei Jahren vom Beet nehmen. Wenn ihr eine gute Sorte angebaut habt, k\u00f6nnt ihr pro Pflanze mit einem Ertrag von bis zu einem halben Kilo rechnen.\n\nDie OBI GmbH & Co.

It sits high above a canyon and enjoys views of the hills, city lights, and the ocean. The building site is narrow, rests below and alongside the street, and is highly visible. The architectural solution was to assemble a collection of elements of different forms and colors into a cohesive, sculptural whole. The house was completed in 2003.\n\nABOUT ARCHITECT DAVID M. PARKER: David Parker studied fine art and environmental design at California State University, Fullerton, Ca., and today is in private practice in Laguna Beach, California, specializing in custom residential. Some of the architects which have influenced his work are Frank Lloyd Wright, John Lautner, Bart Prince, and Ricardo Legorreta. He is currently writing a book with the working title: \"Beyond Style: The Ultimate House\".\n\nABOUT CINEMATOGRAPHER CRAIG HUNG: Craig Hung is owner of CyberHung Productions Studios (CP Studios) in Orange County, an independent media production studio. Though strongly rooted in filming to editing for motion pictures, his services extend to still photography, graphic design, web design, and more.\n\nABOUT PIANIST GLORIA CHENG: Gloria Cheng is widely recognized as one of today's foremost interpreters of contemporary music. She has premiered dozens of new compositions including works composed specifically for her by John Adams, Mark Applebaum, Pierre Boulez, Don Davis, Joan Huang, Terry Riley, Stephen Andrew Taylor, Esa-Pekka Salonen, and Andrew Waggoner. Of the world premiere of Salonens Dichotomie, the Los Angeles Times described her performance as miraculous in the sheer speed and sureness of her fingers, in the rich depth of color and sonority she obtained from the piano, and in the sheer expression of joy she brought to a demanding new work. Gramophone has described her as technically fearless, and the New York Times has praised her impressive fluency and power. Ms. Cheng's solo discs include music by Messiaen on Koch and three releases on Telarc: Piano Music of John Adams and Terry Riley; Piano Dance: A 20th-Century Portrait; and Piano Music of Salonen, Stucky and Lutoslawski.\n\nABOUT COMPOSER ALBERTO GINASTERA: Alberto Evaristo Ginastera (April 11, 1916  June 25, 1983) was an Argentine composer of classical music. He is considered one of the most important Latin American classical composers. Ginastera grouped his music into three periods: \"Objective Nationalism\" (19341948), \"Subjective Nationalism\" (19481958), and \"Neo-Expressionism\" (19581983). Among other distinguishing features, these periods vary in their use of traditional Argentine musical elements. His Objective Nationalistic works often integrate Argentine folk themes in a straightforward fashion, while works in the later periods incorporate traditional elements in increasingly abstracted forms.\n\nCopyright 2008 by DMP Architect, in assoc. with CP Studios & Gloria Cheng", "title": "Mah Residence, Laguna Beach \"Montage\"; music performed by Gloria Cheng", "publishedDate": "2008-11-09T07:09:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "0YBEpIsNclE", "description": "Majuba Power Plant coal silo about to collapse.", "title": "Majuba Power Plant coal Silo collapse Eskom", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T13:34:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "0YBTVCZ8hxs", "description": "Shot 100% on the HD HERO3\u00ae camera from \u202ahttp://GoPro.com.\n\nAfter three straight days of cold, dreary rain in Russells Point, Ohio the sun finally poked out long enough for Chris Lamb and his cousins, Drew and Derek, to get in some hillbilly style wakeboarding.\n\nMusic Courtesy of ExtremeMusic\nhttps://www.extrememusic.com/", "title": "GoPro: Hillbilly Wakeboarding", "publishedDate": "2014-05-11T16:00:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "0YBVpsVLZeo", "description": "I used  Milkweed seed I harvested locally to insulate a set of old Leather choppers.

There are also two populations of this subspecies on the slopes of the Cordillera Oriental of the Andes on the Venezuelan border: one population is found in the R\u00edo Catatumbo watershed in the Department of Norte de Santander and the other population is found in the north-east piedmont forest of the Department of Arauca (Hern\u00e1ndez-Camacho and Cooper 1976; Defler 2003, 2004). \n\nThe subspecies has a disrupted distribution in Venezuela (Mondolfi and Eisenberg 1979). It is located in the north, along the south-eastern part of the Central Mountain Range (Cordillera de la Costa) in the state of Miranda, and probably the state of Vargas. It is also located on both sides of the Venezuelan Andean Mountains (states of Zulia, T\u00e1chira, M\u00e9rida, Trujillo, Portuguesa, Apure and Barinas). In its eastern part, this primate is distributed on the piedmont forest and in the highly threatened lowland forests of San Camilo and Ticoporo. On the western side, it is also distributed in the piedmont of the Andes throughout the lowland areas of southern Lake Maracaibo to the Perij\u00e1 Mountains (Sierra de Perij\u00e1) along the border with Colombia (Bodini and P\u00e9rez-Hern\u00e1ndez 1987; Linares 1998; Cordero-Rodr\u00edguez and Biord 2001; Portillo and Vel\u00e1squez 2006; Duque 2007; B.

Und Krebs ist aus Dahlkescher Sicht eindeutig eine Krankheit der Seele. Diesem Szenario stellt er die heilende Ern\u00e4hrung entgegen: Die neuesten neuroendokrinologischen Erkenntnisse zeigen welche Hormone unsere seelische Balance bestimmen und wie sie mit hochwertigen Kohlenhydraten und Fetten befeuert werden.

Fluridone is for management of vegetation in fresh water ponds, lakes resevoirs, and drainage canals. \n\nActive Ingredient: Fluridone (1-methyl-3-phenyl-5-phenyl-4-pyridinone) 41.7%\n\nTarget weeds: Fluridone works very well at controlling and killing duckweed, spatterdock, water-lily, bladderwort, coontail, elodea, egeria, fanwort, hydrilla, cabomba, naiad, pondweed, watermilfoil, and paragrass. Other aquatic weeds will be partially controlled by Floridone depending on the water movement and application methods.\n\nFor use in: Fluridone is for use in freshwater ponds, canals, lakes, reservoirs, and other areas of static water.\n\nApplication: Fluridone's mix rate varies based on application method. Fluridone should be applied at rates of 45-90 parts per billion for maximum effectiveness. See fluridone generic sonar herbicide mix rate chart below for exact measurements. Do not irrigate with fluridone treated water for 30 days or until PPB is below 10. Plants should be continuously exposed to Fluridone for 45 days for best results.\n\nCoverage Area: Fluridone aquatic herbicide coverage areas will depend on water depth and concentration levels. See Fluridone application chart for your expected coverage area.\n\nShelf Life: Fluridone Generic Sonar Herbicide has a shelf life of approximately 2 years when stored in a cool dry environment.", "title": "How to Use Fluridone Aquatic Herbicide (Generic Sonar) for Watermilfoil Control", "publishedDate": "2013-07-26T17:19:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Ys-6L930qs", "description": "thanks tor whatching not by me!!!!! but funny\n\ncall of duty 5 beta gameplay multiplayer 4 COD5 COD 5 infinity ward xbox 360 microsoft sony playstation play station three 3 PS3 wii nintendo world war 2 WW2 WWII Gears of War GOW 2 1 halo 1 2 3 longshot pwnage owned own3d terrible nine year old n00b glitches terrible Nizmojoe clan exo outsider hitmanN nick nerd trash kid headshot blood gore idiot gears tourque bow grenade cod 1 2 3 4 knife Call of Duty 4 3 2 1 cod3 cod2 cod h2 h3 halo 3 C.E.

Repent to Allah before it is too late oh Muslims. \n\nRepentance is not merely a word to be uttered by the tongue; rather, it has conditions and pillars in order to be valid and accepted. These conditions were deduced by prominent scholars from the text of the Quran and the Sunnah (Prophetic tradition) of the master of the Messengers,  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allaah exalt his mention ). These conditions can be summarized as follows:\n\nFirst condition: sincerity, that is to say that repentance should be meant for the pleasure of Allaah The Almighty so that He turns to the slave with mercy and forgives him the sins he committed. It should not be intended for showing off, drawing closer to people or to protect oneself from the harm of an authority or a ruler.\n \nSecond condition: remorse for the sins he committed. The Prophet,  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allaah exalt his mention ), said: \"Feeling regret is repentance.\" [Ahmad and Al-Haakim] [Al Albaani: Saheeh] The reason is that the feeling of remorse is evidence of one\u2019s sincere repentance.  \n \nThird condition: which is the most important condition: giving up the sin. If the sin was abandoning an obligatory act, you should quit this sin by performing the act. For example, if someone who is negligent in performing the congregational prayer wishes to repent, he should adhere to congregational prayer. If he was negligent in dutifulness to his parents, he should be dutiful to them and if he was negligent in maintaining kinship ties, he should maintain them and so on.\n \nIf the sin was committing a forbidden act, one\u2019s duty would be to give it up immediately and not to continue it for even one more minute. If he used to devour Riba (usury), he should get rid of it by abandoning it, keeping away from it and donating the earnings he earned from usury.\n \nIf the sin was cheating, lying to people and breach of trust, one should refrain from this. If he earned money through these forbidden acts, he should return it to its real owner or seek his pardon. If it was backbiting, he should abstain from backbiting people and slandering their reputations. However, if a person says that he repents to Allaah The Almighty while insisting upon abandoning obligatory acts and committing forbidden acts, his repentance will not be accepted, rather, it is as if he is mocking Allaah The Almighty, as how can you repent to Allaah The Almighty while you insist on disobeying Him?\n \nOn the other hand, if the sin you committed involves other people, whether you had beaten someone or the like, go to him and allow him to beat you just as you had beaten him. If you had beaten him on the back, let him beat you on the back, if on the head, so on the head or anywhere, let him take retribution for Allaah The Almighty Says (what means):\n \n\u00b7        {And the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it} [Quran 42:40]\n\u00b7         {So whoever has assaulted you, then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you.} [Quran 2:194]\n \nIf you harmed someone verbally, such as insulting him in front of people, scolding him and reproachfully reminding him of something, then, you must go to him and seek his pardon even if he says, \"I will not pardon you except in return for a certain amount of money\", give him what he demands.\n \nFourth condition: determination not to repeat this act in the future. If you intend to return to an act of disobedience whenever you get an opportunity, then the repentance is not valid. For example, if a man used to spend money in disobeying Allaah The Almighty, buying alcohol and travelling to countries for adultery and intoxicants, then, he was stricken by poverty and said: O Allaah, I repent to You, while he still intends to return to his habits, if things return to his former condition. This is the repentance of those who are beyond help. This repentance is unacceptable.\n \nFifth condition: repentance should be at a time when repentance may be accepted. If he repents at a time when repentance is not accepted, then his repentance is useless. \n\nLike - Share - Comment - Subscribe", "title": "Repent To Allah \u1d34\u1d30 | Powerful Islamic Reminder | MDM", "publishedDate": "2014-08-31T10:44:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Yx8EzL05Qs", "description": "Pez Ballesta ( Balistes carolinensis) la excesiva confianza de estos peces los hace muy vulnerables , y mas aun cuando est\u00e1n pr\u00e1cticamente amaestrados como podemos ver aqu\u00ed comiendo de la mano de la gente, desgraciadamente esto sirvi\u00f3 para terminar en la cazuela de alg\u00fan \"pescador\" que  lo habr\u00e1 considerado un \"deporte emocionante\".

They are also known as sphinx moths. They have stout bodies, relatively small, narrow wings and long tongues or proboscis. They fly chiefly at dusk.\n\n Because the hawk moths have relatively heavy bodies (packed with powerful muscles) and small, narrow triangular wings, they are not able to glide and can fly only with fast powerful beats. The wings moving so quickly that they can be seen only as a blur. The hawk moths can hover, with furiously beating wings, in front of a flower, extend their long tongue and suck up nectar without alighting.  Some of them can even fly backward.\n\n The caterpillars of hawk moths or sphinx are usually impressive and large, which in most species have a sharp horn at the rear end. Like most moths, their pupae are brown and smooth.A great many moth caterpillars merely dig down into the ground and there pupate with no cocoon.\n\nFor the \u201cPandakaki\u201d hawk moth,which I have called as such because the caterpillars lived on the leaves of the medicinal \u201cPandakaki\u201d plant, it took fourteen days in the pupal stage before the imago or the adult moth emerged.\n\nSources:  Grolier\u2019s \u201cThe Book of Knowledge\u201d 1962, Volume 18, pp. \n                   6523-6540.\n        Encyclopedia International 1969 Volume 12, p.302 and \n                   Volume 8, p. 349.\n\nThese moths, Daphnis Nerii, are known as the Oleander Hawk Moth or Army Green Moth found in Mangaon, Maharashtra, India However, there the caterpillars feed mainly on oleander (Nerium oleander) leaves, a highly toxic plant to which toxicity they are immune. They also may feed on most plants of the Dogbane family, such as Adenium obesum, and Tabernaemontana divaricata and Alstonia scholaris in India.\n\n         The newborn caterpillars are pale blue. Their color changes to green as they grow. They have two spots resembling eyes on the forefront of their body.\n\n       The pupa is pale reddish or brownish-white and has a wax-like appearance. It lies directly on the earth, under moss or dry leaves.\n\n       Daphnis nerii is a large hawk-moth found in wide areas of Africa and Asia. It is a migratory species, flying to parts of eastern and southern Europe during the summer, particularly Turkey.\n\nSource: Wikipedia, \"Hawk Moth\" and \"Daphnis Nerii\".", "title": "Lovely Pets Uncut 31Speckled Hawk Moth Pupa_1m25nbg", "publishedDate": "2010-01-07T10:53:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ZQ4-RgJrlk", "description": "Species: Common Tailorbird Orthotomus sutorius maculicollis -- bathing\nLocation: Canning Garden Home, Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia\nHabitat: \"Wild\" Urban Garden\nDate: 2nd August 2012\nEquipment: Nikon V1 with FT1 adapter & Nikon 18-300mm f/3.5-5.6G VR D\n\nRemarks\nI have previously posted the Common Tailorbirds in our garden bathing.

The result is an all day adventure filled with socially awkward situations and untimely roadblocks as Fred struggles to preserve his New York City world in this modern take on the classic screwball comedy. \n\nWhy It's FilmBuff: We love The Pill for its honest look at relationships and its reach beyond the traditional romantic comedy genre.  Told from a male perspective, the unexpected twists of heroes becoming antiheroes make us reflect on our own personal relationships.  Are we always the hero in our own story?

Both species are added as main ingredients in hundreds of Traditional Formulations used both internally as well as externally.  While collecting ingredients for these formulations Kusum and Saliha growing side by side are preferred.

Casting proper shadows onto the hair, however, appears to be as expensive if not more so, than using actual geometry, e.g., this movie (lypoglycans = hair) rendered with C4Dr13's new Physical camera took almost 15 hours on my macbook air with shadows set to medium.

In 2013 the BC halibut regulations changed, implementing a two part size limit so we have to release alot of halibut.  The circle hook is a good choice because it always hooks into the corner of the mouth and not deep inside the throat or gut, making for an easy release.  Fishing with a circle hook you need to set the rig to the bottom, reel up a few cranks, place the rod in the rodholder, set the drag to as loose as it will go, and turn on the clicker.  When a halibut starts biting allow it to take out some line for a bit and then slowly tighten the drag on the fish. The circle hook will do the rest.\n\nFor more information goto www.FishingBC.COM\n\nI hope this video is of value to you.

Deadpan rich boy Harold (Bud Cort) keeps staging elaborate suicide tableaux to get the attention of his mother (Vivian Pickles), but she keeps planning his brilliant future for him instead. Obsessed with the trappings of death, Harold freaks out his blind dates, modifies his new sports car to look like a mini-hearse, and attends funerals, where he meets the spirited Maude (Ruth Gordon). An eccentric to the core, Maude lives exactly as she pleases, with avid collecting and nude modeling among her many pursuits. To the disgust of Harold's relatives and the befuddlement of Harold's shrink, Harold falls in love with her. As lilting Cat Stevens tunes play on the soundtrack, Maude teaches Harold a valuable lesson about making the most of his time on earth.\n\n\"harold and maude\",\"harold and maude clip\",\"harold and maude trailer\",\"harold and maude part 1\",\"harold and maude soundtrack\",\"harold and maude trouble\",\"harold and maude full movie\",\"bud cort\",\"ruth gordon\",\"hal ashby\",\"classic comedies\",classics,\"cult comedies\",\"dark humor black comedies\",\"charles mulvehill\",\"colin higgins\",\"life and death videos\",\"loss videos\",\"love videos\",\"ambulance videos\",harold,maude,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++21605,/m/03jgbp,/m/06g4l", "title": "Harold and Maude (8/8) Movie CLIP - Maude's 80th Birthday (1971) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-10T19:51:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ZzUF8nfTfs", "description": "Nancy Hughes is a nationally recognized American Diabetes Association author and authoritative food consultant.
