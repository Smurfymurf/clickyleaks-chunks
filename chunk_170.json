The park (Elephant Nature Park) she founded in the mid 90's has provided a sanctuary for elephants to live in a peaceful natural environment with a focus on rescuing elephants that have been abused, disabled and orphaned from the begging, logging and tourism industries.\n\nWith a specific emphasis on rescue and conservation as opposed to training, riding and elephant shows, the park allows visitors to feed, bathe, pet and learn the personal history and (often) tragic stories behind the individual elephants that together number 37 in the park (32 females and 5 males).  Aside from elephants the park is also home to over 400 dogs, 50 water buffalo, 30 cats, horses, pigs, macaques and cows. \n\nThe highlight for us was having the opportunity to bathe and feed the elephants in a natural river setting.  Having witnessed elephants engaged in the tourism industry it was the first opportunity I've had to spend time with elephants in a natural setting with no expectations placed on these majestic creatures to carrying hoards of tourists and/or perform ridiculous stunts.\n\nLearning more about the rights of elephants, in which they are considered mere livestock by the Thai government, it was disheartening to hear about how they're abused, forced away from the care of their mother at an early age and basically groomed and dispirited to entertain 'farang' (Thai for foreigner) who visit Thailand.  Armed with this knowledge I'll never again support tourism that involves Elephant mistreatment in any way, shape or form.\n\nVisiting the Elephant Nature Park in Thailand was an eye opening and educational experience that had a life changing impact upon me.  Please enjoy the video above (our experience at the ENP) and check back soon for a photo essay and story from our time spent at this wonderful sanctuary.\n\nToday we're taking a fun little day trip outside of Chiang Mai.  We are visiting the Elephant Nature Park, which is about sixty kilometers outside of the city. This is an elephant rescue and rehabilitation center, so we're going to be showing you around.\n\nThis center is also a refuge for a number of injured and abandoned animals such as dogs, cats, water buffalo and others.\n\nWe have a bucket full of fresh fruit and on today's menu for the elephants are bananas and watermelons.\n\nHi Baby! \n\nNo bananas.  Nope!\n\nThat was my first time touching an elephant and their skin is surprisingly course and hairy.\n\nRight now the rescue center is home to thirty seven elephants.  Thirty two of them are female and five of them are male.  These are Asian elephants, which vary from the African elephant.  The African elephant is actually a lot larger than the Asian elephant and they also have much bigger ears.\n\nMost of the elephants on the site have been rescued from logging, tourism and begging industries.\n\nThis is the happiest time of day!  The elephants are now being bathed.\n\nOverall, the experience at the Elephant Nature Park has been phenomenal.  We've really enjoyed having an opportunity to feed, bathe and interact with all of the elephants.  It is a great alternative to doing the trekking where you are just sitting on top of the elephant and they are working.  This way you get to spend time with the elephant in its natural environment feeding it and just having a great time.\n\nhttp://nomadicsamuel.com/video-blog/elephant-nature-park\n\nThis is part of our Travel in Thailand series.

Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. They are the only surviving proboscideans; extinct species include mammoths and mastodons. The largest living terrestrial animals, male African elephants can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). These animals have several distinctive features, including a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes, particularly for grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which serve as tools for moving objects and digging and as weapons for fighting. The elephant's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of its body. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\n\nElephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance, and predators such as lions, tigers, hyenas and wild dogs usually target only the young elephants (or \"calves\"). Females (\"cows\") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch, often the oldest cow. Elephants have a fission-fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Males (\"bulls\") leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions.[2] Metropolitan areas, include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.\nA metropolitan area combines an urban agglomeration (the contiguous, built-up area) with zones not necessarily urban in character, but closely bound to the center by employment or other commerce. These outlying zones are sometimes known as a commuter belt, and may extend well beyond the urban zone, to other political entities. For example, El Monte, California is considered part of the Los Angeles' metro area in the United States.\nIn practice, the parameters of metropolitan areas, in both official and unofficial usage, are not consistent. Sometimes they are little different from an urban area, and in other cases they cover broad regions that have little relation to a single urban settlement; comparative statistics for metropolitan area should take this into account. Population figures given for one metro area can vary by millions.\nThere has been no significant change in the basic concept of metropolitan areas since its adoption in 1950,[4] although significant changes in geographic distributions have occurred since then, and more are expected.[5] Because of the fluidity of the term \"metropolitan statistical area,\" the term used colloquially is more often \"metro service area,\" \"metro area,\" or \"MSA\" taken to include not only a city, but also surrounding suburban, exurban and sometimes rural areas, all which it is presumed to influence.\nA polycentric metropolitan area is one not connected by continuous development or conurbation, which requires urban contiguity. In defining a metropolitan area, it is sufficient that a city or cities form a nucleus that other areas have a high degree of integration with.\nSource-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area", "title": "An Evening at a metropolitan.", "publishedDate": "2013-11-20T22:08:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "9iigRsqNC_8", "description": "", "title": "David Blaine   Barstow Cool", "publishedDate": "2013-07-27T18:21:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "9iiof35d8TM", "description": "We decided to grow our cucumbers this year using an arched trellis.

Chimti is a long needle like object, which is slightly flat at one end and this is used to slice through the wax and scoop flakes out of the ears. The salaai is basically used for cleaning the ear and applying oil after the flakes are taken out by the chimti.\n\nBefore applying the oil, which the ear cleaners claim to be ayurvedic, the ear cleaner stuffs the salaai's end with small amount of cotton and dips the same in the oil. More often than not, mustard oil mixed with garlic and turmeric powder is used.\n\nAlthough the headgear of the ear cleaners is almost the same whether it is in Mumbai, Kolkata or Goa, it is the names of the instruments that differ from place to place.\n\nSource :- Wikipedia\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

About twenty percent of older people with long sightedness will not be eligible for the process.\n\nThe process.\n\nThe Lasik procedure is very painless. A surgeon with a great bedside manor will speak the patient via the procedure. treatment is fast, taking around 10 minutes max per eye.

No needles will be utilized throughout the process, as the pain relief from the drops is adequate.

This may be irritable and even painful. This high level of pain ought to not last more than 2 to 3 hours, and by the next day, the patient should feel totally regular again.

It lived during the Late Cretaceous Period (Maastrichtian stage) of what is now North America. Remains have been excavated in Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming. It was an herbivorous or omnivorous creature which is only known from a single skull and a few extremely thick skull roofs. This dinosaur is monotypic, meaning the type species, P. wyomingensis, is the only known species. Pachycephalosaurus was one of the last non-avian dinosaurs before the K--T extinction event. Another dinosaur, Tylosteus of western North America, has been synonymized with Pachycephalosaurus. Like other pachycephalosaurids, Pachycephalosaurus was a bipedal omnivore with an extremely thick skull roof. It possessed long hindlimbs and small forelimbs. Pachycephalosaurus is the largest known pachycephalosaur, measuring nearly 4.5--5 meters (15 --16 ft) in length and up to 2000 kilograms (4400 lb) in weight. The thick skull domes of Pachycephalosaurus and related genera gave rise to the theory that pachycephalosaurs used their skulls in intraspecific combat. This theory has been discredited in recent years.", "title": "Spore New Pachycephalosaurus", "publishedDate": "2008-08-02T11:01:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "9jJddBDs51I", "description": "Triple Bagging of Cowpea Seeds in Bamana (accent from Mali) (Moon version)\n\nCowpea bruchids (Callosobruchus maculatus) can cause significant damage to cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) seeds in storage. Instead of using chemical pesticides to control these bruchids, this animation shows the use of hermetic sealing of plastic bags (triple bagging) to minimize pest damage over long-term (multiple months) storage of the cowpea seeds. This allows farmers to save their seeds for a time when this commodity has a higher market value. This allows for safe storage of the cowpeas without the use of pesticides. In the video, which can be used on smart phones, we describe the steps needed for hermetically sealing cowpea seeds in a series of plastic bags. The two inner bags are for hermetic sealing and the outer third bag, which is made of woven material, is used to protect the inner bags from damage.

There is one for each day of the month.\n\nFor the word of God is LIVING and POWERFUL, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even TO THE DIVISION OF SOUL AND MARROW AND SPIRIT, and of joints and marrow, and is a DISCERNER of the THOUGHTS and INTENTS of the HEART.  \n\nAnd there is no creature hidden from HIS sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of HIM to whom we must give account.      Hebrews 4.12-13\n\n*******************PROVERBS*****************\n\n1 A man who isolates himself seeks his own desire;\n      He rages against all wise judgment. \n       2 A fool has no delight in understanding, \n      But in expressing his own heart. \n       3 When the wicked comes, contempt comes also; \n      And with dishonor comes reproach. \n       4 The words of a man's mouth are deep waters; \n      The wellspring of wisdom is a flowing brook. \n       5 It is not good to show partiality to the wicked, \n      Or to overthrow the righteous in judgment. \n       6 A fool's lips enter into contention, \n      And his mouth calls for blows. \n       7 A fool's mouth is his destruction, \n      And his lips are the snare of his soul. \n       8 The words of a talebearer are like tasty trifles,[a]\n      And they go down into the inmost body. \n       9 He who is slothful in his work \n      Is a brother to him who is a great destroyer. \n       10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower; \n      The righteous run to it and are safe. \n       11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, \n      And like a high wall in his own esteem. \n       12 Before destruction the heart of a man is haughty, \n      And before honor is humility. \n       13 He who answers a matter before he hears it,\n      It is folly and shame to him. \n       14 The spirit of a man will sustain him in sickness, \n      But who can bear a broken spirit? \n       15 The heart of the prudent acquires knowledge, \n      And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge. \n       16 A man's gift makes room for him, \n      And brings him before great men. \n       17 The first one to plead his cause seems right, \n      Until his neighbor comes and examines him. \n       18 Casting lots causes contentions to cease, \n      And keeps the mighty apart. \n       19 A brother offended is harder to win than a strong city, \n      And contentions are like the bars of a castle. \n       20 A man's stomach shall be satisfied from the fruit of his mouth; \n      From the produce of his lips he shall be filled. \n       21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue, \n      And those who love it will eat its fruit. \n       22 He who finds a wife finds a good thing,\n      And obtains favor from the LORD. \n       23 The poor man uses entreaties, \n      But the rich answers roughly. \n       24 A man who has friends must himself be friendly,[b]\n      But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.", "title": "PROVERBS 18 (the 18th day of the month)", "publishedDate": "2007-07-17T16:10:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "9joqPp3peLg", "description": "Music video by Nicole Scherzinger performing Poison.

A little bit of the heel will on the tail.  You want to find that perfect center.  \n\nGenerally, it helps to keep your leg nice and stiff and straight so that way when you do lean back, you're not going to lean back too far.  You'll have some nice control from your hips.  \n\nIt's also very easy to fall forward or backwards on this one.  If you're afraid of falling backwards, you want to maybe direct some energy towards the ground and not entirely backwards so when you do fall back, it will be a little bit more down than entirely back.  You're less likely to get severely hurt or injured and hit your noggin.  \n\nSo what you really want to do again, straight stiff leg, foot over the bolts.  You're going to want to hop from the front to the back, so maybe even putting your foot on the ground in between instead of just a straight hop, would make it a little bit more easier to do this One Foot Manual.\n\nAgain, if you're having trouble with this trick, you might want to try putting your foot in a different spot on the board.  \n\nEach person has their own preferences when they do tricks and it's very easy to find your own groove as long as you're willing to try and find it.\n\nNow remember, don't be afraid to try a Front Foot Nose Manual.  They're not too difficult and they're not much harder than a One Footed Tail Manual.", "title": "How to Do a 1-Foot Manual | Skateboarding Tricks", "publishedDate": "2013-11-25T17:56:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9jvZrhoKFhs", "description": "Redacted privileged or confidential information easily right in your browser.", "title": "Catalyst CR Demo: REDACTION", "publishedDate": "2009-11-20T19:48:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "9jvi4RaXP1c", "description": "Driving from Libreville airport to town", "title": "Driving from Libreville airport to town", "publishedDate": "2011-09-28T08:51:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "9jwLv7kiCyE", "description": "Questo video \ufffd stato caricato da un cellulare Android.", "title": "Pesci gatto di un mese by ronny", "publishedDate": "2011-07-24T17:19:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "9jwRl0uyo5c", "description": "this tee image shows left sublavian artery with guide wire in situ and with little clockwise rotation one can see the origin of left common carotid artery", "title": "left subclavian and left common carotid artery.avi", "publishedDate": "2012-01-03T16:24:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "9jxGETig6e8", "description": "H\u00e4r tages locket bort fr\u00e5n l\u00e5dan.

The woods are heavy, yellow, and fine-grained, and unlike many other aromatic woods, they retain their fragrance for decades. Sandalwood oil is extracted from the woods for use. Both the wood and the oil produce a distinctive fragrance that has been highly valued for centuries. Consequently, the slow-growing trees have been overharvested in many areas.Sandalwood oil has a distinctive soft, warm, smooth, creamy and milky precious-wood scent. It imparts a long-lasting, woody base to perfumes from the oriental, woody, foug\u00e8re, and chypre families, as well as a fixative to floral and citrus fragrances. When used in smaller proportions in a perfume, it acts as a fixative, enhancing the longevity of other, more volatile, materials in the composite.Sandalwood oil in India is widely used in the cosmetic industry. The main source of true sandalwood, S. album, is a protected species, and demand for it cannot be met. Many species of plants are traded as \"sandalwood\". The genus Santalum has more than 19 species. Traders will often accept oil from closely related species, as well as from unrelated plants such as West Indian sandalwood (Amyris balsamifera) in the family Rutaceae or bastard sandalwood (Myoporum sandwicense, Myoporaceae).Sandalwood paste is integral to rituals and ceremonies, to mark religious utensils, and to decorate the icons of the deities. It is also distributed to devotees, who apply it to their foreheads or the necks and chests.[4] Preparation of the paste is a duty fit only for the pure, and is therefore entrusted in temples and during ceremonies only to priests.\nThe paste is prepared by grinding wood by hand upon granite slabs shaped for the purpose. With the slow addition of water, a thick paste results (called kalabham in South India), which is mixed with saffron or other such pigments to make chandan. Chandan, further mixed with herbs, perfumes, pigments and some other compounds, results in javadhu. Kalabham, chandan. and javadhu are dried and used as kalabham powder, chandan powder and javadhu powder, respectively. Chandan powder is very popular in North India and is also used in Nepal. In Thirupathi after religious tonsure, sandalwood paste is applied to protect the skin. In Hinduism and Ayurveda, sandalwood is thought to bring one closer to the divine. Thus, it is one of the most used holy elements in Hindu and Vedic societies.Sandalwood essential oil was popular in medicine up to 1920-1930, mostly as a urogenital (internal) and skin (external) antiseptic. Its main component, santalol (about 75%), has antimicrobial properties. It is used in aromatherapy and to prepare soaps. Due to this antimicrobial activity, it can be used to clear skin from blackheads and spots, but it must always be properly diluted with a carrier oil. Because of its strength, sandalwood oil should never be applied to the skin without being diluted in a carrier oil.\nThe sandalwood tree can grow in almost any part of India (which is why any Indian will recognize the fragrant wood, even though they might refer to sandalwood by one of its many aliases.) The sandalwood tree flourishes in regions where the climate is cool with moderate rainfall, plentiful sunshine and long periods of dry weather.", "title": "Sandalwood Santalum album Chandan Tree video by Shirishkumar Patil", "publishedDate": "2014-05-11T17:17:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kJcpzvKSqM", "description": "L arte del maestro Ambrogio Sparagna in \"Attaranta\" travolgente e passionale ritmo salentino...", "title": "Ambrogio Sparagna - Attaranta - Pizzica", "publishedDate": "2009-07-02T10:42:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kJsCBN6x0I", "description": "FREE DOWNLOAD EP: NO WAY BACK  \"Defence Mechanism\":\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?kkgagnxaa1sv783\n\nLyrics:\nBetween the lines in the book of human kind some words are carved in blood.\nInnocent lives have been tormented, stomped by boot and shoved in the mud !\n\nWhy is money now religion, selling moral for repay ?!\nWe have made ourselves machines, no matter life blooms in chains ?!\n\nAmong the times, among the ways,\nfew minds have always woken up !!\nThroughout the times, throughout the ways,\nthe global change is yet to come !\n\nThrough this hands we have spilled the sand of time, and heard false apology for comited crime.\nAs we are laying down on the gravel road, through this eyes we found and saw reasons to withdraw !\n\nAnd now with global mindlessness, when all forces interact,\nwhat will be created, earthling heaven or hell ?!\n\nAmong the times, among the ways,\nfew minds have always woken up !!\nThroughout the times, throughout the ways,\nthe global change is yet to come !\n\nSociety has been pushing us further from true form,\nthe stakes have never been this high,\nwe couldn't find our source, but now we know\nthat eternal spark is coming through, leading us to the time of clarity,\nwe are all spawns of it's purity, bringers of hope in this agony !\n\nWe are lost,\nin order next in line with values known to heart,\nderivated from the stream of thoughts ,\nwe are voice spreading through the void !\nGrowing wiser with every day, without hate,\nand this rope is hope that we will stay wide awake,\non our quest to try and reach the sun we are still striving for love,\nthat never comes !\n\nWe are the ones,rising from change !\nThose are the times, depending on us !!", "title": "NO WAY BACK -  ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL", "publishedDate": "2012-06-18T19:16:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kK9cJtgCXo", "description": "Here we show you how to test you relay on the compressor and for a short in the compressor when the compressor won't come on but everything else is running.", "title": "How To Test Refrigerator Relay, Compressor | www.goodappliancesuperstore.com", "publishedDate": "2011-10-19T14:06:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kKFalYJKmE", "description": "Turbospoke Classic is the all new pocket-money-priced bicycle noise maker from Turbospoke. http://www.turbospoke.com/classic \nIt has a totally universal fitment and uses super durable sound cards to make any bike go Zoooom!!

They reveal a great deal about your personality, your taste and possibly even your social outlook. Home painting is the combination of Interior as well as San Antonio exterior painting. While there are many aspects that you can use to differentiate your house from the rest of the surrounding; color is the least expensive and easiest thing to alter.  Before deciding on the paint job you need you decide what you want your house to be; that is attractive to eyes or just a plain yet impressive figure in the neighborhood? The choice is entirely yours and whatever your answer is, color will get it done for you. So let us take look at key points and tips that you need to consider while undertaking a paint job on your exterior walls.\n\n* San Antonio Exterior Painting Tips: If you are looking for a flashy appeal, then go for sharp colors; high toned colors for a flashy house that speaks a loud from the distance.\n\n* San Antonio Exterior Painting Tips: In case you prefer an understated elegance; light toned color is what you should look for.

The blue molecule is unzipping the double helix and copying one of the two strands. The yellow chain snaking out of the top is a close chemical cousin of DNA called RNA. The building blocks to make the RNA enter through an intake hole. They are matched to the DNA - letter by letter - to copy the gene. \n\nAt this point the RNA needs to be edited before it can be translated into a protein. This editing process is called splicing, which involves removing the green non-coding regions called \"introns\", leaving only the yellow, protein-coding \"exons.\" Splicing begins with assembly of factors at the intron/exon borders, which act as beacons to guide small proteins to form a splicing machine, called the spliceosome. The animation is showing this happening in real time. The spliceosome then brings the exons on either side of the intron very close together, ready to be cut. One end of the intron is cut and folded back on itself to join and form a loop. The spliceosome then cuts the RNA to release the loop and join the two exons together. The edited RNA and intron are released, and the spliceosome disassembles. This process is repeated for every intron in the RNA. Numerous spliceosomes remove all the introns so that the edited RNA contains only exons, which are the complete instructions for the protein. Again, this is happening in real time. \n\nWhen the RNA copy is complete, it snakes out into the outer part of the cell. Then all the components of a molecular factory called a ribosome lock together around the RNA. It translates the genetic information in the RNA into a string of amino acids that will become a protein. Special transfer molecules \u2014 the green triangles \u2014 bring each amino acid to the ribosome. Inside the ribosome, the RNA is pulled through like a tape. There are different transfer molecules for each of the twenty amino acids, shown as small red tips. The code for each amino acid is read off the RNA, three letters at a time, and matched to three corresponding letters on the transfer molecules. The amino acid is added to the growing protein chain and after a few seconds the protein starts to emerge from the ribosome. Ribosomes can make many proteins. It just depends what genetic message you feed into the RNA.", "title": "The Central Dogma of Biology", "publishedDate": "2012-04-13T19:24:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kOqZTMr7RE", "description": "Synthies: Synthsound1\nVocals: Solitudinarian\n\nThis one is meant as a tribute to Jacques Cousteau (1910 - 1997) and \nJohn Denver (1943-1997), who memoralized Cousteau in his song Calypso.", "title": "Erasure - \"Stay with me\" cover by Synthsound1 and Solitudinarian", "publishedDate": "2011-02-12T12:38:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kOy6zQe1YQ", "description": "", "title": "Ceyhun Muazzin Kerbalayi Mubin  Ahlibeyt meddahlari", "publishedDate": "2009-09-17T02:08:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kP7ZNvQPI4", "description": "by GTAHammer\n\n\nPlease subcribe here: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=GTAHammer", "title": "The Demarcation of Skyrim", "publishedDate": "2012-09-05T20:15:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kP8IRXBymE", "description": "Una buena versi\u00f3n de esta excepcional canci\u00f3n, espero que os guste porque es de las pocas que hay con algo de movimiento.\n\n\"Now if you need me\nCall me\nNo matter where you are\nNo matter how far\nDon't worry baby\nJust call out my name\nI'll be there in a hurry\nYou don't have to worry\n\n'Cause baby, there ain't no mountain high enough\nAin't no valley low enough\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you, babe\n\nRemember the day\nI set you free\nI told you, you could always count on me, darling\nAnd from that day on\nI made a vow\nI'll be there when you want me\nSome way, some how\n\n'Cause baby, there ain't no mountain high enough\nAin't no valley low enough\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you, babe\n\nAnd no wind (no wind)\nAnd no rain (no rain)\nOr winter's cold\nCan stop me, baby (oh baby)\n'Cause if you're ever in trouble\nI'll be there on the double\nJust send for me, baby\nOh baby\n\nMy love is alive\nDeep down in my heart\nAlthough we're miles apart\nIf you ever need\nA helping hand\nI'll be there on the double\nJust as fast as I can\n\n'Cause baby, there ain't no mountain high enough\nAin't no valley low enough\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you, babe\n\nAin't no mountain high enough\nAin't no valley low enough\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from you\n\nAin't no mountain high enough\nAin't no valley low enough\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from you\n\nAaaahhh...\nNothing can keep me\nKeep me from you\nAin't no mountain high enough\nNothing can keep me\nKeep me from you\nAaaahhh...\nNothing can keep me\nKeep me from you\"", "title": "Ain't no mountain high enough by Sister Act 2", "publishedDate": "2007-06-27T11:36:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kPA7fQSAsM", "description": "", "title": "Canine Companions for Independence", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T20:14:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kQ2bc56J1w", "description": "Copyright Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University", "title": "Gestational Age Assessment", "publishedDate": "2012-08-07T20:04:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kQAmHxN-pA", "description": "1st AOT Indonesia\nServer Laurasia \nGrup B\nSatriani VS Bocahajaib", "title": "1st AOT Server Laurasia Grup B Satriani VS Bocahajaib", "publishedDate": "2010-10-25T06:21:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kQPgC_NIVI", "description": "one of the most famous DID contestant DHARMESH SIR, a beautiful performance of a talented guy.......", "title": "Dharmesh Sir in boogie woogie.........", "publishedDate": "2010-04-05T04:53:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kQW569DLHI", "description": "The marks on Lana Sinclair\u2019s face are no match for the emotional scars her son received this past Halloween, according to a report by Raw Story.\n\nThat\u2019s when she received a visit from two Winnipeg policemen for a seemingly innocuous noise complaint.

The process starts when DNA is wrapped around special protein molecules called histones. The combined loop of DNA and protein is called a nucleosome. Next the nucleosomes are packaged into a thread, which is sometimes described as \"beads on a string\". The end result is a fiber known as chromatin. Now the chromatin fiber is coiled into a structure called a \"solenoid\". This fiber is then looped and coiled yet again, leading finally to the familiar shapes known as chromosomes, which can be seen in the nucleus of dividing cells. Chromosomes are not always present. They form around the time cells divide when the two copies of the cell's DNA need to be separated. At other times, as we can see now after the cell has divided, our DNA is less highly organized. It is still wrapped up around the histones, but not coiled into chromosomes.", "title": "How DNA is Packaged (Basic)", "publishedDate": "2010-03-22T20:09:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kQrWE4sDBg", "description": "Tom Sebastian laat bij Anna Kersten een chique opsteekkapsel zien met de Twin'fit Barrette.

Still, Randi understands why such frauds appeal to people.\n\n\nQuestion: What does the JREF consider a legitimate test of \nparanormal claims?\nA test of any specific claim is going to depend entirely upon that \nclaim.\u00a0 If you say you can speak to dead people, I've got a whole load \nof questions I would like to ask certain dead people.\u00a0 Answers to which I\n already have, and the dead people, since they are dead, I don't believe\n they've got the answers any longer, but if you want to call them up and\n ask them the questions and come up with the right answer, hey, you \ncould win the million dollars.\u00a0 Now, many people say they can read \nminds, they can predict the future, they can interpret dreams and such, \nwell, it all depends on the specific claim they make.\u00a0 All they have to \ndo is say what they can do, under what circumstances, with what \naccuracy.\u00a0 \nAnd some people have taken, literally, years.\u00a0 One fellow, a PhD in \nCalifornia took four and a half years to answer those three questions, \nand finally when we got ready to enter into tests with him of \"remote \nviewing,\" as he called it, and he actually gave courses in this at the \nuniversity in California, he suddenly changed his email address and his \ntelephone number.\u00a0 We haven't been able to reach him since. Isn't that \nstrange?\u00a0 I guess he doesn't need the million dollars.\nQuestion: What has been the most difficult paranormal claim for the \nJREF to disprove?James Randi: I'd like to say that there has been one particularly\n difficult one, but no, they've all been so easy.\u00a0 They've been so easy \nbecause they've been so transparent. I've been in this business for a \nlong, long time and I've seen everything.\u00a0 Recently, I got a nice \ncontract to go to South Korea and do a TV series, which I did there, \ntesting South Korean \"psychics,\" so-called.\u00a0 And they told me before I \nleft, they said, \"Oh, Mr. Randi, you signed the contract, so I guess we \nshould tell, we've got psychics in South Korea that you've never seen \nbefore.\"\u00a0 And I went off there with my assistant and we looked at them \nand turned to one another and said, \"Wait a minute. This is the same \nthing that has been going on since the 1600s. It's in all the books. \nIt's exactly the same thing. They're serving kimchee at lunch instead of\n macaroni, or whatever, but in any different culture, in any differen...\n the costume is different, the language is different, but the same \nstunts are being done again, and again, and again.\u00a0 They haven't \ninvented anything new since the early 1600s. \n\u00a0\nQuestion: Do you believe supernatural thinking is ingrained in human\n cognition?James Randi: Well, you'd have to ask a psychologist, and perhaps a\n few psychiatrists that question because technically I can't answer that\n question.\u00a0 But I will tell you, I suspect strongly that people need to \nhave some more romance in their lives.\u00a0 After all, look at the average \nkid who is male or female who was raised by their parents who believe \nthat he or she will have children and will have a wife or a husband and \nthey will be absolutely ideal people and everything will go... you will \nbe a doctor, or lawyer, or you'll be very wealthy, have a beautiful \nhome.\u00a0 It doesn't work out that way all the time.\u00a0 In fact, it seldom \nworks out that way.\u00a0 And so they look around and say, \"What have I done \nwrong?\"\u00a0 And them somebody runs an ad on television saying, \"Oh, I can \nsolve your problems.\u00a0 I can give you guidance to the future, and I can \nlook into the crystal ball, or read the tarot cards,\" or whatever.\u00a0 They\n may tend to fall for that sort of thing because they say, \"They \nwouldn't' say that if it weren't true.\"\u00a0 Oh, yes, they would.\u00a0 And \nthere's a huge profit margin in this.\u00a0 So people do fall for these \nthings very, very easily.Recorded April 16, 2010Interviewed by Austin Allen", "title": "How to Squash a Paranormal Claim", "publishedDate": "2012-04-24T00:41:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kVhCDxwd8k", "description": "Rhacodactylus ciliatus 2", "title": "Rhacodactylus ciliatus 2.mp4", "publishedDate": "2010-04-20T16:44:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kVubP6cxLE", "description": "barbie movie collection all 27 movies chronological order list ( 2001 - 2014)\n\nbest list on barbie movies", "title": "BARBIE MOVIE COLLECTION ALL 27 MOVIES CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER LIST ( 2001 - 2014)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-11T14:07:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kW7OBXsXck", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/hotrodmag\nhttp://www.hotrod.com/\nHere it is...Two of the most famous cars of all time in a an all out car chase!\nNo matter which car is your favorite, everyone wins with this feature video shot in the Arkansas countryside with A REAL GENERAL LEE.\nCrank up your speakers and enjoy!\nSpecial thanks to Mark Osborne of Southern Coating & Nameplate, Inc.

The system is composed by four robotic limbs with anthropomorphic kinematics and has a total of 22 independently actuated degrees of freedom. The leg locomotion and the force servo-amplification allow operations in environments that are hardly accessible by the conventional handling systems preserving the force sensibility during the manipulative tasks. Possible applications are handling of heavy materials in narrow spaces, rescuing of victims in natural and human provoked disasters and assembly of large products.\nThe Body Extender has been successfully demonstrated in March 2009.

It says Israelis were \"chosen people\" and that God promised them \"a holy land\" in return for their faithfulness. And till this very day, that is the basis of the Israeli claims over the Palestinian lands.\n\nSuch \"tragedies\" Sand sees projected in the latest move by Israeli officials to cut ties with the UN Human Rights Council over investigations into Jewish settlements in the West Bank. He describes this move as \"suicidal\" and says the world must \"save Israel from itself\".\n\nSand calls this \"the longest nationalistic conflict in modern history\". He believes Zionism is a severe type of nationalism - and as such, its ideologists have resorted to ethnic cleansing not only in the occupied territories, but also towards their own citizens who don't consider themselves Jews.\n\nShlomo Sand's book \"The Invention of the Jewish People\" became a best-seller throughout Europe. His new work - \"The invention of the land of Israel\" is expected with even greater anticipation.\n\nMore: http://leaksource.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/jewish-historian-israel-has-no-rights-in-land-dispute/", "title": "Jewish Historian: Israel Has No Rights in Land Dispute", "publishedDate": "2012-04-14T05:45:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ktsOjfw1tI", "description": "My Smosh animation I created.

Anchored by Crumb's contributions to the seminal anthology Weirdo, created and edited by Crumb, this volume includes the first several appearances of classic Crumb character Mode O' Day, the networking fashion plate that serves as a foil for some of Crumb's most biting satire about America's cultural \"elite.\" Other Weirdo highlights include Crumb's fascinating adaptation of Dr. R. Von Krafft-Ebing's \"Psychopathia Sexualis,\" and \"Where Has it Gone, all the Beautiful Music of Our Grandparents?\", two stories often-cited as being amongst Crumb's very best work. The Weirdo section wraps up with yet another classic, \"The Religious Experience of Philip K. Dick,\" which chronicles the last years of the highly-regarded science-fiction writer who experienced an intense vision of the apocalypse and believed that he was possessed by the spirit of Elijah. Also included are Crumb's first collaborations with the late writer Charles Bukowski, including the chapbook \"Bring Me Your Love,\" as well as several collaborations with Harvey Pekar from his autobiographical series American Splendor. The book is rounded out with a color section that includes rare album art for various jazz and blues greats, as well reproductions of his various comic book covers from this period and an introduction by Peter Bagge. Crumb is the most revealing of all artists, and The Complete Crumb Comics leaves no stone unturned.", "title": "The Complete Crumb Comics Vol. 15: Mode O'Day and Her Pals by Robert Crumb - video preview", "publishedDate": "2011-05-03T09:04:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "9kv5hgCgOnE", "description": "Morgan Freeman reading Everyone Poops.

He was an active and honest propagator of WAHDAT-E-UMMAT (Unity of Muslim Ummah) and for this cause he struggled in his life till the end. It is his one of the another contribution that he always preached the true essence of Islam, free from any type of negative constraints or influence E.g. schism, exhibition of knowledge, pride or for worldly gain etc. His knowledge was so vast and his memory was remarkable that he used to appreciate the contribution of Ulama (scholars) without any discrimination whether they are Brailvi, Deobandi or Ahle Hadees or whoever else. Maulana Ishaq is equally popular among the youth and the old ones. He is liked among Religious or Liberal class through his teachings/lectures to seek guidance from it. \n\n\nMaulana Mufti Ishaq rahmatullah ailah never associated him to any group (Maslak) instead he always called himself a Muslim and his all lectures are purely related to the original primitive teaching of Islam. He always addressed the issues of the questioners and provided them with best solution. This could only be possible if the Religion (ISLAM) is taken into his complete sense.\n\nHis efforts are appreciable and unforgettable. May Allah bless him with Jannat ul firdous .

Ka\u017cdy utw\u00f3r sam w sobie jest muzyczn\u0105 podr\u00f3\u017c\u0105.

products are not subjected to the rigorous testing required by the government for medications.\n\nNow, a Harvard researcher is warning a dietary supplement he tested, called Craze, may contain a meth-like party drug.\n\n\"Alarmingly we have found a drug in a mainstream sports supplement that has never been studied in humans,\" says Dr. Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said in a press release. \"The health risk of using supplements adulterated with a drug should not be underestimated.\"\n\nScientists looked into the Craze supplement, marketed by Driven Sports, Inc., after it was flagged in several failed drug tests. Cohen teamed up with the independent testing global health organization NSF International to analyze Craze's contents.\n\nWhat they found was a substance called N,alpha-diethylphenylethylamine (N,a-DEPEA), which the researchers called structurally similar to methamphetamine. Their analysis put the stimulant at a level less potent than methamphetamine, but more potent than ephedra, a stimulant banned by the Food and Drug Administration in 2003 after it was linked to heart attacks.\n\nN,a-DEPEA was not listed on the product's label and may be harmful, according to the researchers. A similar compound however was found on the label: N,N-diethylphenylethylamine, which the company claimed was derived from extract of the dendrobium orchid. Driven Sports' claim that the compound was related to orchids could not be verified by the scientists' testing.\n\n\"It might be that manufacturers are not actually using the orchid at all, but rather using the name 'dendrobium' when actually placing pharmaceutical drugs into the supplement,\" Cohen told Consumer Reports. \"It is very likely that some other supplements labeled as containing dendrobium contain this same new drug.\"\n\nThe researchers also found the meth-like compound in a weight loss supplement called Detonate, marketed by Gaspari Nutrition.\n\nBoth products are sold in vitamin and supplement retail and online shops.\n\nThe study was published Oct. 14 in the journal Drug Testing and Analysis.\n\nCohen told CBSNews.com in an email he has not personally seen someone harmed from the products, but said he became interested when the new \"party drug\" was appearing worldwide in the urine tests of athletes claiming to only be taking natural supplements.\n\n\"What we're trying to do here is get this product removed before we have the bodies -- trying to avoid what's currently happening in Hawaii with OxyElite Pro (with a) new ingredient introduced leading to multiple patients with liver failure -- so, here we are trying to take a pro-active approach,\" he said.\n\nThe FDA announced last week OxyElite Pro marketed by USPlabs LLC of Dallas, Texas was linked to more than 20 cases of the liver infection hepatitis, with two cases of people needing transplants and one death.\n\n\"With that said, there's no effective method to monitor people injured by supplements -- so, it most likely has already occurred and will take us time to put the pieces together,\" he added.\n\nIn July, USA Today investigated Driven Sports after some of the company's weight loss products were found to contain toxic pesticides linked to adverse events including the overdose death of a 17-year-old girl.\n\n\n \nConsumer Reports: 10 hidden dangers of vitamins\nThe report noted the Craze pre-workout powder was named 2012's \"New Supplement of the Year\" by bodybuilding.com, but lab tests conducted at the time of the report detected amphetamine-like compounds in the products.\n\nUSA Today's report led sites like bodybuilding.com and Walmart.com to suspend product sales, according to the newspaper.\n\n\"We have previously provided USA Today with a plethora of data from a DEA Certified Lab indicating the absence of any amphetamine-like compound in Craze,\" Marc Ullman, an attorney for Driven Sports, told the newspaper Monday. \"In light of USA Today's decision to ignore the data we have provided, we respectfully decline to comment for your story.\"\n\nThe latest report spotlights some of the unknowns people face when taking supplements. In addition to the ongoing OxyElite pro concerns, this summer, the FDA found a vitamin B supplement may contain anabolic steroids after about 30 complaints of side effects.\n\nDietary supplements are not approved by the FDA for safety and effectiveness before they are marketed, and manufactures responsible for reporting any side effects or illnesses stemming from the products to the agency. If a product is found to be unsafe, adulterated or makes misleading health claims, only then can the agency take it off the market.", "title": "Meth-Like Substance Found In 'Craze' Workout Supplement", "publishedDate": "2013-10-16T03:53:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "9l8Gyqs3J5o", "description": "1 second = 1.5 hours\n\nhttp://www.dotcadot.ca", "title": "Teasel Flower Sprout - Time-Lapse", "publishedDate": "2013-04-23T06:45:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "9l9I1a1OKok", "description": "i do not own any content.", "title": "kuroko no basket kuroko's vanishing shot (hd)", "publishedDate": "2014-03-04T15:32:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9l9Lf-YRQ7w", "description": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Macedonian-Idol/112930492106882", "title": "Macedonian Idol Kumanovska Azbuka", "publishedDate": "2010-12-04T22:02:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9l9NsK4Lr24", "description": "CAN WE GET 2.5K LIKES FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF 2 NEW SERIES THIS WEEK!?\n\nWe hope you guys enjoy this awesome new chapter!

I put a piece of paper in the bottom to collect feces and a bottle cap for water.\n\nFeeding is done with very small live pinkies where most of my babies eat right away but some do better leaving the pinkie in over night. If your corn turns away the pinkie you can try feeding a different pinkie the second day and leave it in over night as well. Dont stress right away if your hatchling does not eat, they do just fine for up to 6 weeks without eating. After the 6 week mark you should consider other options.\nIve found that lizards such as small green or brown anoles are eaten quickly in some of my hatchlings that do refuse pinks.\n\nI keep all of my deli cups in a drawer system like you get from Walmart that are made by Sterilite. The small drawers the I use hold 4 deli cups in each drawer and each rack has 3 drawers.\n\nIf you have any questions please feel free to contact me and or leave a comment.

Seriously, next time you see a coin bucket, put a little bit in for me.\n\nDOWNLOAD LINK:\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?mb6la6h1fx0byz2\nCompletely free, so go do a good deed instead.

But we're also not so dense that we'd sacrifice loop functionality for one-button simplicity. Wally gives you the looping tricks you need in an extremely small and cool looking droid, and you can figure it out with a 30 second scan over the manual! With the smart LED lights letting you know what mode you're in, you're ready to go.\n\nWally rises above the other compact loopers by making up for their functional deficiencies. We designed Wally to include independent in/out volume controls\u2014after all, you can't get the loop and recording levels sounding right with just one knob. So loop away, you got fifteen minutes of storeable loop phrases! Then we added a knob so you can increase or decrease the loop tempo, which you can use to mix things up on stage.\n\nHow did we get all that into the smallest looper stompbox out there? With a little intuition: we stacked the circuit boards and then squeezed them into a durable zinc-alloy casing.\n\nWhy you need it: Every guitarist should have a looper at least for songwriting and phrase practice, if not also for layering it on for the big buildup on stage.

It can reach heights up to 3 meters and has beautiful red branches characteristic of most manzanitas, which is the colloquial name for the Arctostaphylos genus of plants. There are 106 species of manzanita in this genus, 95 of which live in California. Manzanitas range all the way from British Columbia Province in Canada to Baja California in Mexico.\n\nAs you can see from the video, this species of manzanita has furry leaves that resemble green felt in appearance. Manzanitas stand out from other chaparral biome plants a mile away with their red or orange twisted trunks and dense attractive foliage. Eastwood manzanita varies in appearance throughout its home range, with several subspecies, but this particular one has many spade-shaped leaves. This subspecies appears to be Adam's manzanita, which appears in San Diego County.\n\nAdam's manzanita is reported to be very drought tolerant and deer tolerant. It grows in reddish clay or decomposed granite in a acidity range of pH 5-7 on rocky outcrops, chaparral hills, or yellow pine forests up to 2150 meters above sea level.\n\nSome manzanita species are the rarest plants in the world.

The harpsichord is joined by Lennon's guitar (mimicking the harpsichord line) played through a Leslie speaker. Then vocals and bass guitar enter.\n\"Because\" was one of few Beatles recordings to feature a Moog synthesiser, played by George Harrison. It appears in what Alan Pollack refers to as the \"mini-bridge\"[2], and then again at the end of the song. The group were among the first in contemporary rock & roll to experiment with a Moog, though the instrument had been used before (notably by bands such as The Doors, Simon & Garfunkel and The Monkees, whose Daily Nightly was the first rock recording to feature the Moog.\nAccording to Lennon, the song's close musical resemblance to Ludwig van Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\" was no coincidence: \"Yoko was playing Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata' on the piano ... I said, 'Can you play those chords backwards?', and wrote 'Because' around them. The lyrics speak for themselves ... No imagery, no obscure references.\"[1][3]\n\nMusical structure\n\nWith regard to the controversy Lennon initiated by citing Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\" as an inspiration, musicologist Walter Everett notes that \"both arpeggiate triads and seventh chords in C# minor in the baritone range of a keyboard instrument at a slow tempo, move through the submediant to \u266dII and approach vii dim 7/IV via a common tone.\"[4] One similarity is that \"Because\", which also is in C#, opens with a \u266dVI (A chord on ...\"cause\"), moves to a i chord (C#m on \"wind\") then the \u266dVI7 (A7 on \"high\") before shifting to a \u266dii dim (D dim) on \"love is old love is new\" (IV-F#). The third measure of the \"Moonlight Sonata\" does have this \u266dVI (A chord) to \u266dII (D/F# chord) move, but Dominic Pedler notes that this is not an inspiration happening through reversal as Lennon suggested.[5]\n\"Because\" concludes with a vocal fade-out on D dim, which keeps listeners in suspense as they wait for the return to the home key of C#. Mellers states that: \"causality is released and there is no before and no after: because that flat supertonic is a moment of revelation, it needs no resolution.\"[6] The D dim chord (and its accompanying melodic F natural) lingers until they resolve into the opening Am chord of \"You Never Give Me Your Money\" so that the D dim in retrospect was operating as a vii dim 7 of Am.[7]\n\nRecording\n\nThe main recording session for \"Because\" was on 1 August 1969, with vocal overdubs on 4 August, and a double-tracked Moog synthesiser overdub by Harrison on 5 August.[8] As a result, this was the last song on the album to be committed to tape, although there were still overdubs for other incomplete songs. This approach took extensive rehearsal, and more than five hours of extremely focused recording, to capture correctly. McCartney and Harrison both said was their favourite track on Abbey Road. \"They knew they were doing something special,\" said engineer Geoff Emerick, \"and they were determined to get it right.\" [9] Versions of the song, without instrumentation, can be found on 1997's Anthology 3 and 2006's Love. Both versions highlight the three part harmony by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, though the Love version is slowed down and includes overdubbed birdsong.\n[edit]Personnel\n\nJohn Lennon -- triple-tracked lead harmony vocals (middle register), guitar\nPaul McCartney -- triple-tracked second harmony vocals (high register), bass\nGeorge Harrison -- triple-tracked third harmony vocals (low register), Moog synthesiser\nGeorge Martin -- electric spinet Baldwin harpsichord\nPersonnel per Ian MacDonald", "title": "Dirty Blind - Because (Beatles Cover) Live in Woodstock, NY", "publishedDate": "2012-08-16T20:01:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "9lfxKAQaaPg", "description": "Crkokli Sisters - Toxic | \u05d4\u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05db\u05e8\u05e7\u05d5\u05e7\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d1\u05d1\u05d9\u05e6\u05d5\u05e2 \u05de\u05d3\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d8\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e1\n\u05dc\u05d0\u05ea\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\u05de\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d4\u05ea\u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea: http://reshet.tv/shows/the_x_factor_israel/\n\u05dc\u05e2\u05e8\u05d5\u05e5 \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05d8\u05d9\u05d5\u05d1: https://www.youtube.com/user/XFactorIsrael/featured\n\u05dc\u05d4\u05e6\u05d8\u05e8\u05e4\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05e2\u05e8\u05d5\u05e5 \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\u05de\u05d9: http://www.youtube.co/subscription_center?add_user=XFactorIsrael\n\u05dc\u05d4\u05e6\u05d8\u05e8\u05e4\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05e1\u05d1\u05d5\u05e7 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d4\u05ea\u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea: https://www.facebook.com/XFactorIsrael?ref=br_tf", "title": "\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc X Factor - \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05db\u05e8\u05e7\u05d5\u05e7\u05dc\u05d9 - Toxic", "publishedDate": "2013-11-02T19:15:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "9lgXuEqolos", "description": "http://jb.asm.org/cgi/content/full/184/7/1827?view=long&pmid=11889087", "title": "optical tweezer Mycoplasma mobile.mpg", "publishedDate": "2010-01-30T05:00:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "9lhGY7kr41I", "description": "Al Sharpton's analysis: repeat whatever clip he just played from a conservative verbatim, but do it with an upward inflection.", "title": "17 times Al Sharpton repeated what he just heard in the form of a question | SUPERcuts! #111", "publishedDate": "2014-10-14T16:10:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "9lhcnzmG4GM", "description": "I'll show you how to find the point of interest just north of eastern ward.

The videos are:\n\nPart 1 = http://youtu.be/9lrbriWoTVc?hd=1\nPart 2 = http://youtu.be/s4vsTTUP5yk?hd=1\nFlange Part Overview = http://youtu.be/c8BPxTTsSKc?hd=1\n\nTo watch the Flange Cement Slab Playlist = http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=EE77441842E186B3\n\nFlange Install on Cement Floor\n\nSome toilets are installed and mounted directly over cement slabs.  This type of installation is usually found on the 1st floor of a house.  During the original construction, ABS glue is applied to the toilet flange, which, on cement slabs, is usually a 4-inch female flange, and the toilet flange is inserted into the sewer inlet.  Pilot holes are then drilled into the cement, and then cement screws are installed, securing the flange to the cement slab.  Next, hard flooring is installed to the base of the sewer line, or carpet to the base of the toilet.  The wax ring is then placed and the toilet is mounted over the flange.  \n\nThe toilet flange and wax ring will endure for many years under perfect conditions; however, water is often exposed to this area.  This exposure will not affect the cement slab and toilet base, but a metal flange securing the toilet to the cement floor will corrode and fall apart if the exposure is prolonged.  Once the toilet flange falls apart the toilet will become unstable and begin to move, causing the toilet to leak water at its base.\n\nThere are two ways this problem can be corrected.  The first way is by installing a replacement ring over the top of the existing flange.  This can be a useful fix in situations where the flange's mounting guides are broken or its cement holes are stripped, requiring new holes to be drilled.  The repair ring should not be used however, if the flange is corroded or rusted out, as a repair ring placed on top of a rusted flange will only become rusted itself.  \n\nThe second way to fix this problem is to cut out the damaged flange's metal ring, leaving the ABS coupling, and install an inside fitting flange.  The reason that this technique is suggested, rather than removing the entire old outside female flange, is because the fit between the cement and the sewer inlet can be so tight that cement would need to be chipped away in order to rid the sewer inlet of the old flange's outside ABS coupling.  This is possible, however, not highly recommended, as new cement would have to be patched in.  Furthermore, in most situations an inside fitting flange can be quickly and effectively installed, and easily removed and replaced in the future. \n\nFlange Inspection\n\nTo establish which of these techniques to use, the toilet needs to be removed, and the wax ring needs to be cleaned, so that the flange can be inspected closely.  The flange should be free of any type of rust or corrosion and the mounting channels should not be bent outward or appear to be broken.  The flange itself should be securely mounted to the cement slab.\n\nParts Needed\n\nThe parts needed for this repair are a new flange or flange repair ring, depending on the technique that will be used; cement screws, to secure the flange or ring to the cement slab; ABS glue, to seal the flange to the sewer inlet; and a new wax ring and toilet mounting bolts.\n\nTools Needed\n\nThe tools needed to perform this repair are: an electric drill to drill starter holes and screw in the cement screws; a cement drill bit that fits the size of the cement screws; a wire brush to clean the old flange if necessary; a flathead screwdriver and possibly a mini hacksaw.", "title": "How to Fix a Toilet - Cement Sub-Flooring Repairs - Part 1 of 2", "publishedDate": "2011-01-04T14:39:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9lrjZ1Inm34", "description": "Brainwave Student Website Tour", "title": "Brainwave Student Website Tour", "publishedDate": "2012-06-07T08:46:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ls5OC7EBFw", "description": "What what goes in the butt?~\n\nI SAID IT AND HERE IT IS :D\n\nFirst of all...don't judge me...Tumblr is my idol q.q\n\n\nDun Dun DUUUN another waisted day of my life xD!\nWell I have nothing much to say, but enjoy it and the track list is coming soon.\n\nKoujaku: OH MY GOSH!", "title": "DRAMAtical Murder Crack 2 [The next step of GAYNESS]", "publishedDate": "2014-09-14T18:58:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "9lsuHpq1L0c", "description": "Micro pigs love a belly rub as you can see here.\nOriginal viral video of a micro pig on a bed getting lots of love.\nPlease subscribe to our channel today to get our latest little piggy videos.\nYou can find petpiggies on Facebook and follow us on Twitter @petpiggies", "title": "Micro pig on bed enjoys having a tummy rub", "publishedDate": "2013-05-29T18:31:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9lsy97f2rv0", "description": "Slippery try... / Intento resbaladizo...", "title": "Moorhen, Gallineta com\u00fan (Gallinula chloropus) BIRDAYTRIP (2014.03.29)", "publishedDate": "2014-03-29T17:27:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "9lt9rFKh2vs", "description": "Lamprologus Meleagris very \"happy\" with the new shells of Neothauma Tanganyicense on their tank.", "title": "Lamprologus Meleagris", "publishedDate": "2012-04-23T09:02:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ltL1FNxSvw", "description": "Het gaat slecht met de huizenmarkt in Nederland.

These boxes contain 2.5 million signatures. It's one of the best-supported petitions the EP has received. It concerns ACTA, the international Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which, the petitioners believe, will compromise a free and open internet. All EU citizens and residents can take MEPs to task by submitting a petition either individually or jointly with others. Petitions can take the form of a complaint or a request and relate to private or public issues as long as the petitioners are directly affected. The petition is then sent by post or electronically. Its first stop is the Secretariat of the EP's Petitions Committee. In 2011 we received around 1,500 petitions from all the EU countries. Of those 1,500 petitions, I think about 800 or 900, maybe more, were admissible. A petition is admissible if it comes within the EU's areas of activity. Some of this petitions go nowhere, because their subject must come within the EU's areas of activity. These areas of activity are the environment, fundamental rights, the internal market, justice, transport and issues concerning freedom of the press, freedom of expression etcetera. The question of admissibility is considered in writing, but in certain urgent cases like ACTA the procedure can be accelerated, with the coordinators of the Petitions Committee meeting behind closed doors. The coordinators' office has deemed the anti-ACTA petition admissible. Once a petition is declared admissible by the Petitions Committee, its future has three possible outcomes. It is most frequently sent to the Commission which conducts a preliminary investigation. Sometimes the Petitions Committee refers it to another committee specialising in that particular field, such as the environment, industry or the economy. In exceptional cases the Petitions Committee conducts its own investigation and submits a full report to be voted upon in plenary. We can go beyond what the European Commission decides. We can approach local authorities, we can conduct fact-finding missions if necessary, we can even request a resolution in Parliament so that all MEPs can have a say. The Petitions Committee's goal is simple, to draw attention to a particular problem and open a debate. The impact is not always easy to measure. The many successes on environmental issues haven't been the only ones. For example in 2011 an Italian lorry driver won his case after being taxed twice by Italian and German authorities.

It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "The First Most Common Question Asked About Eczema is, What is Eczema?", "publishedDate": "2014-01-28T11:06:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9m6RbCBMSnQ", "description": "The world's largest car ferry, Irish Ferries' giant ship 'Ulysses' leaves Dublin port, on her way to Holyhead in Wales", "title": "The world's largest car ferry", "publishedDate": "2011-02-13T20:34:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9m6cDV2Kn7I", "description": "Rob DesLauriers of Sotheby's and Realty Group of Jackson Hole introduces real estate options in  Teton Village, WY and the iconic Jackson Hole Mountain Resort.

And now, dogs speak for those that cannot speak for themselves:  Cloud Computing.  \n\nAccording to the updated Global Cloud Index, 2013 \u2013 2018, 76 percent of global data center traffic will come from business and consumer cloud applications (up from 54 percent in 2013). This is just one of the interesting projections and trends revealed in the update report:\n \nVisit http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/global-cloud-index-gci/Cloud_Index_White_Paper.html?CAMPAIGN=GCI+2014&COUNTRY_SITE=us&POSITION=social+media+organic&REFERRING_SITE=YouTube&CREATIVE=Youtube+to+GCI+WP for the detailed Global Cloud Index white paper. \n\n-Global data center IP traffic will nearly triple (2.8-fold) over the next 5 years.Overall, data center IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23 percent from 2013 to 2018.\n-Global cloud IP traffic will nearly quadruple (3.9-fold) over the next 5 years. Overall, cloud IP traffic will grow at a CAGR of 32 percent from 2013 to 2018.\n-By 2018, 53 percent (2 billion) of the consumer Internet population will use personal cloud storage, up from 38 percent (922 million users) in 2013.\n \nWhat's driving the migration to cloud computing? It\u2019s the realization of the benefits of greater virtualization. Generally speaking, cloud-based data centers perform more efficiently, can handle more applications, and can support more users than traditional on-premise data centers. \n \nFollow our Twitter conversations with #CiscoGCI or tweet us @CiscoVNI if you have any questions.", "title": "A Dog\u2019s View on the Cisco Global Cloud Index", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T13:04:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "9m6ogS57sc8", "description": "Music video by Juan Magan performing Bailando Por Ahi.

Two studies are cited that directly relate to the observational research we conducted: Jones & Foshay (1984) which established that the principle of the bystander effect applies in non-emergency situations and Bell (2006) which stated that the sex of the confederate does not influence the behavior of the bystanders. \n\nOut study involves a young child sitting alone at a mall. Will anyone intervene or interact with her to ensure that she is all right? Observations and findings are reported. \n\nThree distinct observations were recorded. \n\n1. One six different occasions, a child around the same age as the confederate exhibited focused attention on the confederate. In all six instances the adult with the child did not interact with the confederate. \n2. On four occasions, an adult sat on the same bench with the confederate or a bench directly across from the confederate. None of these initiated interaction with her. \n3. The most common reactions of adults were to look away or to look straight ahead. \n\nIn order to conduct this study we had to meet standards established by both our institutions and the management and security of the mall. To ensure the safety of our confederate, we videotaped the entire study and at all times four individuals were watching and were ready to intervene, if necessary. Our protocol was that when somone began an interaction, one of us would immediately intervene to ensure the safety of the child. \n\nReferences \n\nBell, S.L. (2006).

Alternative common names include Glory Wattle, Pilliga Wattle and Golden Wattle. It grows to between 1.5 and 4 metres metres high and has pinnate leaves. The bright-yellow globular flowerheads appear in axillary racemes, mostly between July and November in its native range. These are followed by thin leathery pods which are 4--17 cm long and 10--19 mm wide.

Many non-Australian species tend to be thorny, whereas the majority of Australian acacias are not.  The genus Acacia previously contained roughly 1,300 species, about 960 of them native to Australia, with the remainder spread around the tropical to warm-temperate regions of both hemispheres, including Europe, Africa, southern Asia, and the Americas.  Acacias in Australia probably evolved their fire resistance about 20 million years ago when fossilised charcoal deposits show a large increase, indicating that fire was a factor even then. With no major mountain ranges or rivers to prevent their spread, the wattles began to spread all over the continent as it dried and fires became more common. The small flowers have five very small petals, almost hidden by the long stamens, and are arranged in dense, globular or cylindrical clusters; they are yellow or cream-colored in most species, whitish in some, or even purple (Acacia purpureopetala) or red (Acacia leprosa (Scarlet Blaze)). Acacia flowers can be distinguished from those of a large related genus, Albizia, by their stamens, which are not joined at the base. Also, unlike individual Mimosa flowers, those of Acacia have more than ten stamens.  Acacia seeds can be difficult to germinate. Research has found that immersing the seeds in various temperatures (usually around 80\u00b0C (176\u00b0F)) and manual seed coat chipping can improve growth to around 80%. See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia\n\nNineteen different species of Acacia in the Americas contain cyanogenic glycosides, which, if exposed to an enzyme which specifically splits glycosides, can release hydrogen cyanide in the \"leaves\". This sometimes results in the poisoning death of livestock.\n\nThe acacia is used as a symbol in Freemasonry, to represent purity and endurance of the soul, and as funerary symbolism signifying resurrection and immortality. The tree gains its importance from the description of the burial of Hiram Abiff, who provided some of the builders for King Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. Egyptian mythology has associated the acacia tree with characteristics of the tree of life, such as in the Myth of Osiris and Isis. (There is a Sanskrit word, akasha, which means aether or spirit.)\n\n\u00c1 j\u00farat\u00edmanum (fyrir 208-144 milj\u00f3n \u00e1rum) er \u00c1stral\u00eda talin hafa veri\u00f0 hluti Su\u00f0urmeginlands, sem var kalla\u00f0 Gondwana.  \u00dea\u00f0 n\u00e1\u00f0i yfir n\u00faverandi Su\u00f0ur-Amer\u00edku, Afr\u00edku, Indland Madagaskar, N\u00fdju-Kalsed\u00f3n\u00edu, N\u00fdja-Sj\u00e1land og Su\u00f0urskautslandi\u00f0.

I am aware that as part of their literature exam, students of these ages need to study Dulce et Decorum Est, a poem by Wilfred Owen. From research, I found out that Rap/Hip-Hop are two favourite genres of students at this age. Furthermore, most of the students learn these lyrics by heart!\n\nSo would it be easier for each and every student to learn a classical poem converted into a song accompanied with a music video?\n\n\nSpecial thanks goes to Chapter Zero who recognized the immense utility such projects have in the education department, and helped throughout.\n\n\nBest Regards, \nMauro D'Amato\n\n\n\n\nWilfred Owen\n\nDulce Et Decorum Est\n\n\n\nBent double, like old beggars under sacks,\nKnock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,\nTill on the haunting flares we turned our backs\nAnd towards our distant rest began to trudge.\nMen marched asleep.
