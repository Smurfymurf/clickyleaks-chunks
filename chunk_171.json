From a more practical point of view, they will not contract HIV from a virgin. The men know that virginity can be faked; there is therefore a huge demand for younger and younger girls, so that clients can be certain of their virginity. A 13 year old girl from the Cambodian countryside can be sold for as much as $1,200. Once her virginity has been taken, she is sold on to brothels, in different parts of Cambodia or over the border in Thailand. Once in the brothel, she is at high risk of disease, and if she manages to escape, faces imprisonment in Thailand, or scorn and rejection back home.\n\nThrough intimate and revealing interviews, men explain why sex with virgins is so important to them. We hear the stories of those whose lives have been ruined by the virginity trade, and speak to politicians, the police and representatives from NGOs. Can anything be done to end the plight of these girls?\n\nView this film in full at http://indieflix.com/indie-films/cambodia-the-virginity-trade-35353/", "title": "Cambodia: The Virginity Trade", "publishedDate": "2013-10-30T20:15:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "9migZv8smWI", "description": "maternity photography : http://maternity-photography.blogspot.com/\nOver the past few years there has been an increasing demand for experienced pregnancy photographers.

In 1554, Queen Mary I (Kathy Burke) tries to restore Catholicism as England's single faith. With no heir to the crown, she maneuvers to keep her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) from succeeding her, but her efforts fail. With Mary dead, Elizabeth is proclaimed Queen of England in November 1558. Elizabeth relishes the return from exile of her childhood sweetheart, Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes). Chief adviser Sir William Cecil (Richard Attenborough) urges the young Queen to forget personal matters and instead address the country's pressing problems. England is bankrupt, has no army, and is under serious threat from abroad. Elizabeth even has enemies within her own court, the most dangerous being the Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston). Hoping for an heir, Cecil suggests marriage candidates -- King Philip II of Spain or the French Duc d'Anjou (Vincent Cassel) -- to secure the realm. Elizabeth agrees to meet their ambassadors, but her true feelings are revealed when she meets Dudley for a secret tryst. French \"warrior queen\" Mary of Guise (Fanny Ardent) amasses troops at the Scottish border. Elizabeth bows to the pro-War lobby led by Norfolk, despite protests from her Master of Spies, the enigmatic Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), but the decision to fight leads to a humiliating defeat. As dark clouds of court conspiracies gather, and the possibility of assassination looms, Elizabeth strikes out at her enemies and puts her trust in Walsingham. Shown at 1998 film fests (Venice, Toronto), this is the first English-language film of Indian director Shekhar Kapur, who shot on locations at Northumberland, Derbyshire, North Yorkshire, and at Shepperton Studios.\n\nelizabeth,\"elizabeth clip\",\"elizabeth gillies\",\"elizabeth taylor\",\"cate blanchett\",\"geoffrey rush\",\"joseph fiennes\",\"richard attenborough\",\"shekhar kapur\",\"ring videos\",biography,drama,epics,\"period pieces\",\"united kingdom\",\"eric fellner\",\"liza chasin\",\"debra hayward\",\"leadership videos\",\"power videos\",\"rebirth videos\",\"transformation videos\",\"virtue videos\",\"elizabeth i\",\"sir francis walsingham\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++173470,/m/0kr5_,/m/0m31m,/m/0170pk,/m/0154qm", "title": "Elizabeth (11/11) Movie CLIP - The Virgin Queen (1998) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T13:32:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mn_2UEpnDQ", "description": "Descarga Aqui \u2192\u2192http://www.mediafire.com/?2t1s8ey80pimrbl", "title": "Art meson-dont talk", "publishedDate": "2013-04-18T17:54:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mnfzT3wOSw", "description": "A woodpecker working his magic on the branch of a tree in Salt Lake City, Utah.", "title": "Woodpecker pecking some Wood", "publishedDate": "2010-05-21T06:29:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mnioRL2fLQ", "description": "Diretto e ideato da Ciro Grieco e Checco Danza.", "title": "S'ADDA PARIA' - Marco Calone e Raffaello Junior feat Luigi Ivone", "publishedDate": "2012-09-12T20:32:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mo1FyiU2pI", "description": "Enforcing Sharia Law in Norther Nigeria", "title": "Enforcing Sharia Law in Norther Nigeria", "publishedDate": "2013-11-29T20:15:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mojhJJXFjI", "description": "", "title": "Riad Alya\u3000\u30df\u30f3\u30c8\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u3067\u304a\u51fa\u8fce\u3048a", "publishedDate": "2010-09-11T14:56:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "9motSiIi4Gs", "description": "Music Of Ceylon - Adare Ai Podi Mame", "title": "Music Of Ceylon - Adare Ai Podi Mame", "publishedDate": "2012-08-20T22:44:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mp8YkNqbBE", "description": "http://BPgoLow.com/Virgina-Sturms-Natural-Solutions-To-High-BP\n\nHow to lower blood pressure quickly when you find its shot up - soak your feet in warm water.  You will get almost immediate but temporary relief.  I was so luck I knew about this solution when I had my own emergency, the day my BP shot way too high.  A megadose of a supplement I took (Vit B12) backfired.  If you're ever in such a quandary, what do you do - call your doctor, go to the ER?  Yes, please do that.  For me, I soaked my feet in warm water.  I'm not recommending this as a substitute for proper medical treatment.  I'm just saying this is what I did myself, and it worked for me.\n\nOne day, before leaving home, my BP was 171/113.   \nThey say high BP (hypertension) is a \"silent disease\", but it does whisper softly.  I felt it.  It was an uncomfortable feeling, a strong sense of \"something isn't right\". For some it may be a  slight headachy feeling, or a tightness in the head, or dizziness.  If you stop and think, you can feel it if ever your BP shoots way too high.  If ever it does, you'll then be  searching for answers as to how to lower blood pressure quickly, like I was.\n\nSoaking your feet can significantly reduce blood pressure.\nYou don't need to add add anything to the water.\nJust  plain hot tap water will do.  Nothing fancy.  It's the heating of the feet that does it.\nWhy does it work?  I don't know.  It's a curious physiological reaction you can use to your own advantage.\n\nI made this video because if ever you need to know how to lower your blood pressure quickly, this is one natural, quick and easy solution.\n\nMy BP was dropped from about 170/100 down to 140/80, rising a bit thereafter, but not as high as it was before the feet soaking treatment.  What a RELIEF!!!\n\nI hope you find this video on lowering blood pressure quickly helpful to you. Good luck with managing your hypertension.\n\nOnce you know how to lower your blood pressure quickly,  and get your BP down to safer levels,  if you need to find other more permanent solutions for natural BP reduction, please go to  http://BPgoLow.com/Virgina-Sturms-Natural-Solutions-To-High-BP", "title": "How To Lower Blood Pressure Quickly - Quick Natural Way To Lower Your BP", "publishedDate": "2013-06-19T23:53:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mpAonWmeNI", "description": "\u3080\u3057\u3083\u304f\u3057\u3083\u3057\u3066\u3084\u3063\u305f\u3002\u5f8c\u6094\u306f\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\n\u30d8\u30bf\u306a\u308a\u306b\u9811\u5f35\u3063\u305f\n\u4f4e\u8a55\u4fa1\uff12\u500b\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3089\u6d88\u3057\u307e\u3059\u308f", "title": "spellbound", "publishedDate": "2014-10-04T02:09:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mpp-QyoCzs", "description": "Check out these new styles and more from Zappos.com!", "title": "SeaVees 09/61 Volunteer Plimsoll  SKU : # 7917649", "publishedDate": "2012-09-13T11:36:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mpwCGoQguI", "description": "This video describes causes and herbal products to treat oligospermia or low sperm count.

Also read how to cure eczema naturally with proven home remedies. Learn how to cure eczema or dermatitis using natural remedies, lifestyle and diet. There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "Kill the Root Source of Your Eczema and Be Eczema Free For Life!

Taken off HISTORY.COM\n\n\"The state furnishes no machinery for arriving at justice. [It] has no way of arriving at the facts...Some human being has shed his neighbor's blood; the state must take his life. In no other way can the crime be wiped away. In some inconceivable manner it is believed that when this punishment follows, justice has been done. But by no method of reasoning can it be shown that the injustice of killing one man is retrieved by the execution of another, or that the forcible taking of property is made right by confining some human being in a pen.\" - Darrow\n\n\"Endless volumes have been written, and countless lives been sacrificed in an effort to prove that one form of government is better than another; but few seem seriously to have considered the proposition that all government rests on violence and force, is sustained by soldiers, policemen and courts, and is contrary to the ideal peace and order which make for the happiness and progress of the human race. Now and then it is even admitted that in the far distant ages yet to come men may so far develop toward the angelic that political governments will have no need to be. This admission, like the common concept, presumes that governments are good; that their duties undertaken and performed consist in repressing the evil and the lawless, and protecting and caring for the helpless and the weak. If the history of the state proved that governing bodies were ever formed for this purpose or filled this function, there might be some basis for the assumption that government is necessary to preserve order and to defend the weak. But the origin and evolution of the political state show quite another thing \u2014 it shows that the state was born in aggression, and that in all the various stages through which it has passed its essential characteristics have been preserved.\" - Darrow\n\n\"[The] carnage and destruction [is] springing not from any difference between the common people of the earth, but due alone to the desires and passions of the rulers of the earth. This ruling class, ever eager to extend its power and strength, ever looking for new people to govern and new lands to tax, has always been ready to turn its face against other powers to satisfy the ruler's will, and without pity or regret, these rulers have depopulated their kingdoms, and carried ruin and destruction to every portion of the earth for gold and power.\" - Darrow", "title": "Clarence Darrow speaks on Crime", "publishedDate": "2010-07-09T05:41:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ms9X94eYpo", "description": "This is an example of our drawing tutorial for \"How to draw Dragons\" series, feel free to check it out on our website:\nhttp://www.drawdoo.com", "title": "Whispering Death Dragon from Dragons Drawing Tutorial", "publishedDate": "2013-12-26T12:56:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "9msDOOU8aCE", "description": "Tony Abbott has a stack of backbench talent.

This statement is the most succinct advocacy of philosophy, science, and democracy ever since. The spirit of free and open-ended inquiry, the practice of deliberation, and the commitment to a life that is to be lived neither merely biologically, nor unreflectively according to the conventions of surrounding society, but to be approached as a quest for self-knowledge and autonomy, define what the late Cornelius Castoriadis called \"Greco-Western culture\". Freed from any particular culture, those features have been, in several variations and forms, defining aspects of modernity.\n\nWhat better a place to discuss the examined life than Athens, the city in which the possibility for it arose. Socrates, Plato and Aristotle may no longer be around, but their ideas and the Hellenic monuments of classical civilizations are. If theoria is a search for seeing the world (including human life) a little clearer, that search is an interminable journey. The 2015 EGOS Colloquium aspires to be a  lively, thoughtful, and exciting, stop in that journey; an agora of ideas and debates!\n\nEGOS 2015 INFORMATION  Email: egos2015@alba.edu.gr\n\nVideo Credits : Breathtaking Athens Film , http://www.breathtakingathens.com\nACG video material\nMusic : George Varsamakis:My new friend (O \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) www.myspace.com/varsamakis\n\nLogo created by Brittle Design | Constantinos Chaidalis\nThe EGOS 2015 logo combines two ancient Greek Elements: a) The owl, symbol of knowledge, wisdom, perspicacity and erudition & b) The art of mosaic.

In its self-proclaimed status as Caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its direct political control,[2] beginning with nearby territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Kuwait, Cyprus, and an area in southern Turkey that includes Hatay.[41][42]\n\nThe group, in its original form, was composed of and supported by a variety of Sunni insurgent groups, including its predecessor organizations, the Mujahideen Shura Council, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), the insurgent groups Jaysh al-Fatiheen, Jund al-Sahaba, Katbiyan Ansar Al-Tawhid wal Sunnah and Jeish al-Taiifa al-Mansoura, and a number of Iraqi tribes that profess Sunni Islam.\n\nISIS witnessed significant growth as an organization owing to its participation in the Syrian Civil War and the strength of its supreme leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Economic and political discrimination against Iraqi Sunnis since the fall of Saddam Hussein also helped it to gain support. At the height of the Iraq War, its forerunners enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Ninawa, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city.[43][44][45][46] In the ongoing Syrian Civil War, ISIS has a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqa, Idlib and Aleppo.[47][48]\n\nISIS is known for its harsh interpretation of Islam[49] and brutal violence,[50] which is directed particularly against Shia Muslims and Christians.[51] It has at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks[52] who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians.[53] ISIS had close links with al-Qaeda until 2014, but in February of that year, after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its \"notorious intractability\" and wanton brutality.[54][55][55]\n\nISIS's original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq. Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria (see spillover of the Syrian War).[56] A caliphate was eventually proclaimed on 29 June 2014, with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi being named as its caliph, and the group was renamed the Islamic State.\n\nISIS has captured and currently uses American weapons, vehicles, and uniforms in its operations. ISIS members have been seen wearing the standard US Army Combat Uniform along with Interceptor body armor. For night raids, AN/PVS-7 night vision goggles worn with PASGT helmets are used. Some of the weapons used are M16 rifles, M4 carbines, M203 grenade launchers, M60 machine guns, M240 machine guns, RPGs, and surface-to-air Stinger missiles;[110] vehicles used include Humvees, AMZ Dziks, MT-LBs, M1117s,[111] M113 APCs and several T-55 tanks and T-72 tanks.[112] and BREM-1 Recovery Vehicles.[113] During the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, ISIS raided Iraqi Army bases and captured M198 howitzers,[114] Type 59-1 artillery guns, DShK guns mounted on trucks, ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns,[115][116] 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled guns and at least one Scud missile.[117]", "title": "Islamic state fighters rais the flag after freed the area", "publishedDate": "2014-07-05T21:05:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "9muRk2MN1A0", "description": "Calmodulin", "title": "Calmodulin", "publishedDate": "2009-10-22T10:16:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mua-gVBVkw", "description": "j money giving u the exclusive footage", "title": "amazing jamaican women dancing", "publishedDate": "2013-06-16T20:20:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mvCwUbSOt4", "description": "To boldly flee when danger rears its ugly head: this is Steenky Teets, a neurotic goblin of small renown.\n\nSculpted and textured in Zbrush", "title": "Steenky Teets Goblin Underling - Zbrush Turntable", "publishedDate": "2013-02-18T21:43:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mvNdit6f2E", "description": "", "title": "Fall Coho Fishing in Oregon", "publishedDate": "2013-10-31T00:55:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mvl4DfyPCE", "description": "Louis Rawls\nand the\nPilgrim Travelers\nStand By Me Father\nArranged and Conducted By\nJ.W.

With his humorous and profound depictions of everyday objects he is one of the most important and admired artists since the late 1950s. One central point of reference in Oldenburg's oeuvre is the industrially produced object\u2014the object as a commodity which, in ever-new metamorphoses of media and form, becomes a conveyor of culture and a symbol of the imagination, desires, and obsessions of the modern world.\n\nOrganized by the mumok, this is the largest show ever of Oldenburg's ground-breaking and emblematic early work of the 1960s. Numerous icons of Pop art will be seen in the exhibition, beginning with the installation \"The Street\" and its graffiti-inspired depictions of modern life in the big city and continuing to the famous consumer articles of \"The Store\" to the spectacular everyday objects of the modern Home: telephone, toilet bowl, bathtub, fan, saw, and light switch. Another chapter is dedicated to Oldenburg's first designs for the colossal monuments of his consumer objects for public spaces. The exhibition concludes with mumok's \"Mouse Museum\" a walk-in miniature museum in the form of a Geometric Mouse, for which Oldenburg collected 385 objects. With its souvenirs, kitsch objects, and studio models, the \"Mouse Museum\" demonstrates the incredible cultural variety\u2014and mysteriousness\u2014of capitalist society. With its reduction to abstract basic figures of formal invention, the \"Geometric Mouse\", a central motif within the artist's oeuvre, represents a dovetailing of high art and popular culture. It also functions as Oldenburg's alter ego.\n\nThis exhibition, organized by mumok, will travel to the Museum Ludwig in Cologne (June 22--September 30, 2012), the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (October 30, 2012--February 17, 2013), the Museum of Modern Art in New York (April 14--August 5, 2013), and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis (September 13, 2013--January 12, 2014).\n\nCurator: Achim Hochd\u00f6rfer", "title": "Claes Oldenburg: The Sixties", "publishedDate": "2012-03-14T17:51:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9mzw6vJDj_A", "description": "We are Vietnam Mining and Metallurgy JSC, best suppliers of quicklime, dolomite in Vietnam.

Harrison (1883-1927) is one of the truly important figures of twentieth-century history. A brilliant writer, orator, educator, critic, and political activist, he was described by Joel A. Rogers, in \"World's Great Men of Color\" as \"the foremost Afro-American intellect of his time.\" Labor and civil rights leader A. Philip Randolph described Harrison as \"the father of Harlem Radicalism.\"\n\nHarrison served as the foremost Black organizer, agitator, and theoretician in the Socialist Party of New York during its 1912 heyday; he founded the first organization (the Liberty League) and the first newspaper (\"The Voice\") of the militant, World War I-era \"New Negro\" movement; edited \"The New Negro: A Monthly Magazine of a Different Sort\" (\"intended as an organ of the international consciousness of the darker races -- especially of the Negro race\") in 1919; wrote \"When Africa Awakes: The 'Inside Story' of the Stirrings and Strivings of the New Negro in the Western World\" in 1920; and he served as editor of the \"Negro World\" and principal radical influence on the Garvey movement during its radical high point in 1920.\n\nHis views on race and class profoundly influenced a generation of \"New Negro\" militants and common people including the class radical A. Philip Randolph and the race radical Marcus Garvey. Considered more race conscious than Randolph and more class conscious than Garvey, Harrison is the key link in the ideological unity of the two great trends of the Black Liberation Movement -- the labor and civil rights trend associated with Martin Luther King, Jr., and the race and nationalist trend associated with Malcolm X. (Randolph and Garvey were, respectively, the direct links to King marching on Washington, with Randolph at his side, and to Malcolm (whose father was a Garveyite preacher and whose mother wrote for the Negro World), speaking militantly and proudly on street corners in Harlem.\n\nHarrison was also an immensely skilled and popular orator and educator; a highly praised journalist, critic, and book reviewer; a pioneer Black activist in the freethought and birth control movements; and a bibliophile and library builder and popularizer who helped develop the 135th Street Public Library into what is now the internationally famous Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.\n\nFor information on Hubert Harrison see http://www.jeffreybperry.net/disc.htm\nand see http://www.jeffreybperry.net/_center__font_size__3__font_color__green___b_3__hubert_harrison_br___center___fo_86150.htm \nand see http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-13910-6/hubert-harrison\n\nFor a video of Slide Presentation/Talk on Hubert Harrison see \nhttp://www.jeffreybperry.net/_center__font_size__3__font_color__green___b_1__hubert_harrison___i_the_voice_of_76560.htm\n\nThis video introduction to Hubert Harrison is part of a five-part presentation series on Hubert Harrison and Theodore W.

Mix together butter, sugar, cinnamon, currants, peel, nutmeg and orange zest. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to a thickness of about 3 mm (\u215b\"). Then cut 12 rounds about 10 cm (4\"). You can re-work the dough that's left over if you need to. Divide the filling between the 12 pastry rounds. Brush the edges with egg wash and pull them together to make a purse, squeezing tightly to seal. (watch the video)Gently flatten each cake until you can see the currants through the pastry. Place on a parchment lined baking tray, sealed side down. Brush tops with egg wash, then sprinkle with sugar (sometimes we'll leave the sugar off). Using a sharp knife, make 3 parallel cuts on top.Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown.

It is commonly referred to as the whiteknee tarantula, giant whiteknee tarantula, giant white knee tarantula or Brazilian giant whiteknee tarantula as a homage to its brilliant black and white banded legs. This is a medium-large species, fast growing and taking up to 3-4 years to reach a mature legspan of 8.5 inches for females, slightly less for males.\n\nIt is a very fast-growing spider, and due to this, very hungry and greedy.\n\nAlthough it can burrow, it often shows itself, and occasionally will climb up the walls of an enclosure in captivity.\n\nA terrarium needs to be big, and wider than it is high (Minimum: 30 cm high, 40 cm wide, 40 cm long). A special substrate, or a mixture of clay, earth, and sand may be filled to several inches high so that the spider can make tunnels although it likely will not do so. A place to hide should be offered, for example a piece of wood. A bowl with water needs to be supplied. No hard or pointy objects should be placed next to the wall since the spider is an insecure climber and may fall. Should a whiteknee fall on a hard object, its abdomen may split open, which in most cases will lead to the spider's death. If found, a small wound can be treated with talcum powder to aid the clotting process or treated with a liquid bandage or superglue.\n\nWhitebanded tarantulas have been much prized as pets, due to their size, hardiness, and striking coloration. They are moderately defensive, and their urticating hairs can be quite irritating to human skin. These spiders, like many un-domesticated pets, can bite when provoked. Fortunately because they have urticating hairs, biting is typically not their first line of defense. Their venom is not considered medically significant, but due to their large size the puncture damage can be extensive.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_whiteknee_tarantula", "title": "Acanthoscurria Geniculata - closeup view *1080p HD", "publishedDate": "2010-11-21T23:13:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9nXyv8W3XnU", "description": "Coach Explain 2009", "title": "FIREMAN CARRY COACH", "publishedDate": "2009-03-01T01:19:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9nY1efXEzAU", "description": "Volo aeromodello F-16 Falcon motorizzato con ventola intubata a scoppio Byrojet e Rossi 105 FAN.\nCostruito da scatola Gleichauf, ap.alare 1,25m, lunghezza 1,85m, peso 5,3Kg, livrea Thunderbirds, carrelli retrattili ad aria.\nPilota: Martina Massimo, Camera: Martina Sergio", "title": "F-16 Thunderbirds RC Ducted fan Jet Martina Massimo", "publishedDate": "2011-04-11T12:26:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "9nY5U1EDVDI", "description": "", "title": "Driving Main Street Stillwater MN Dec 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-12-16T04:33:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "9nY5Wt77vVM", "description": "\"Be yOu\"", "title": "Richie Hawtin @ TIME WARP 2014 plays Fabio Florido - \"Be yOu\" (Original Mix)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-08T08:10:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "9nY5hNq3VUQ", "description": "The University of Michigan's football program is under fire for letting their quarterback return after a concussion.", "title": "Michigan quarterback plays despite concussion", "publishedDate": "2014-09-30T20:55:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9nY6mKeSIvU", "description": "http://banlieue2franceofficiel.skyrock.com/\nLe \u00ab taux de criminalit\u00e9 \u00bb des quartiers \u00e9tabli sur un calcul statistique.\nUn reportage d'un journal place en t\u00eate les quartiers les plus sensible de France.

The buyer sues the seller for $1 million, wins and is paid $1 million by the seller. Now let's add a \"liquidated damages\" clause into the purchase contract. The same seller and buyer open escrow, but this time there is a liquidated damages clause limiting the monetary damages due to a breach of the purchase contract to $5,000. Something again goes wrong and the deal falls through because of something the seller did. The buyer again sues the seller for $1 million. Even though the buyer wins, however, the amount of the judgment is limited to the amount in the liquidated damages clause which in this case is $5,000.

It is one of my favorite species to show our guests. They fascinate us with their size, their curious flights around our vehicles and the impressive contrast between the cobalt blue of the feathers and the live yellow around the eyes and in the cheeks.\n\nThese animals are extreme specialists, feeding exclusive on two species of palm trees in the Pantanal. The seed of the Acuri Palm (Scheelea phalerata) is their main source of food. The pulp of its fruit is food for various species of birds and mammals, but the Hyacinth Macaw is the only vertebrate species capable of breaking through the hard involucre to eat the nuts inside. They do it skillfully, using their robust beak and strong musculature, holding the fruit in the adequate breaking position with one of the feet. Curiously, these animals use peaces of leaves as tools around the seed, presumably to help the grip, avoiding it to slip.\n \nMany of our guests don't believe when i tell them that they use tools and are bale to break the Acuri Palm fruit and eat the nuts in a few minutes. So, I'd like to share with you this short footage that I had the luck to make recently here at the Caiman Ecological Refuge, registering such behavior!", "title": "Arara-azul alimentando-se / Hyacinth Macaw feeding", "publishedDate": "2014-07-12T21:26:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "9nv-rT6ALTg", "description": "http://www.ourbeautifulgarden.com/\nBeautiful Plant - Spotted Dracaena - Gold Dust Dracaena - Dracaena surculosa", "title": "Beautiful Plant - Spotted Dracaena - Gold Dust Dracaena - Dracaena surculosa", "publishedDate": "2012-10-18T17:02:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9nvAzt9sWIg", "description": "Growing sprouts and plants requires consistent moisture among other things.

But having wings instead of arms and hands, they use their beaks and tongues for many of the same things for which we use hands and fingers. Most parrots already use one foot as a hand to hold and manipulate objects, so their beak and tongue give them a second hand, allowing even greater control and deeper exploration. The beak is actually the more important \"hand.\" It has a much stronger grip than the fingers/toes and and very fine control and coordination. Both beak and tongue also have many nerve endings, making them important tactile sensory instruments. They are the bird's most direct and intimate way of knowing its world (and probably one reason you see parrots running their beaks and tongues all over their cages and whatever else they encounter). \n\nThe beak sends as well as receives information. As a form of communication, biting and beaking express a whole range of emotions\u2014affection and trust, playful taunting, warning, irritation, anger, fear, and more. A bite may be a defense of personal space or a part of snuggling and allopreening. It may mean simply \"No\" or \"Ow!\" or it may be an urgent \"Help! Get away from this danger!\" or an outraged \"You jerk! How dare you!?\" Undoubtedly, this form of communication is important in wild parrot flocks, where birds have been observed perching very close together, chattering, preening, squabbling and playing with one another. \n\nIt's important for people who have companion parrots to understand \"beak language.\"  Paco (our 3-year old Blue-Crowned Conure) demonstrates several different kinds of biting\u2014playful, affectionate, gently-disciplinary, and angry.", "title": "Movie Bites Six Ways!", "publishedDate": "2008-09-22T15:22:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "9nwU6CnDPws", "description": "Nelli (Phyllanthus emblica ) or Indian Gooseberry or aamla is a small to medium size tree.

Wilder Knight II\nScreenwriter: \nFilm Description: Every year, the New York Public School system sponsors a dance competition for youngsters in fifth grade; in this contest, boys and girls ages 10 and 11 learn traditional ballroom dancing styles such as the fox trot, the rumba, and the tango, and then pit their skills against other students from around the Big Apple. Mad Hot Ballroom is a documentary which offers an inside look at this event, as well as the teachers and students who take part, with a particular emphasis on three schools: P.S. 112, in a Bensonhurst neighborhood dominated by Italian and Asian families; P.S. 150, located in the wealthy and fashionable Tribeca district; and P.S. 115, a Washington Heights school where the vast majority of families live below the poverty line. Filmmaker Marilyn Agrelo follows the young dancers as they gain confidence and skill and grow into \"little ladies and gentlemen,\" as one teacher puts it, while also examining how cultural differences impact the competition for some students and how the boys and girls feel about the opposite sex as they begin to make friends with one another. Mad Hot Ballroom received a wildly enthusiastic world premiere at the 2005 Slamdance Film Festival.\n\n\"mad hot ballroom\",\"mad hot ballroom clip\",\"mad hot ballroom part 1\",\"mad hot ballroom merengue\",\"mad hot ballroom dvd\",\"mad hot ballroom documentary\",\"mad hot ballroom rumba\",\"mad hot ballroom swing\",documentary,\"indie documentaries\",\"w wilder knight ii\",\"brian david cange\",\"marilyn agrelo\",\"accomplishment videos\",\"competition videos\",\"confidence videos\",\"success videos\",\"teamwork videos\",\"transformation videos\",\"school videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++320299", "title": "Mad Hot Ballroom (7/9) Movie CLIP - The Crowd Goes Wild!

It turns out that in the mother's breast milk we find their white blood cells and also immuno-globulins from the mother.  This immuno-globulin is digested, so it's not perfect, but it's certainly a good start for your baby and it gives your baby added protection.  It doesn't take the place of vaccines, but it is an adjunct to vaccines.  We would encourage you to breastfeed; exclusive breastfeeding is great if you can do it.  Breastfeeding can go on for a long time -- 6 months is ideal, but there's no reason to stop at 6 months.  Remember, what you are giving your infant when you breastfeed is the optimal nutrition, the benefit of the immunologic aspects and the closeness and bonding of the breastfeeding itself.", "title": "Breastfeeding and Immune system - The Unterberg Children's Hospital at Monmouth Medical Center", "publishedDate": "2012-05-09T02:22:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "9oL-ELTQq4w", "description": "", "title": "Saragota Scleropages jardinii at Territory Wildlife Park, NT, Australia", "publishedDate": "2012-09-11T06:25:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "9oLBY9QqTAQ", "description": "Music video by Fonseca performing Te Mando Flores.

And this is a conical curling wand, meaning it goes from fat to skinny. \n\nA curling iron is going to give you a flat, soft curl that's curled from the, evenly curled from the root to the tip. It's going to give you the most smoothness that you can get out of a curl. So, if you have really textured or frizzy hair, it's going to be your best option.\n\nAlso, if you have damaged ends, the, holding the end of your hair in between the two metal plates actually gives it a lot of smoothness and shine.\n\nThat being said, a wand is a super modern curl. A little bit more like a natural one if it's shaped like this. Because, it keeps a good bit of fullness at the top of the hair and more of a curly look throughout the bottom.\n\nAlso, really fast to use. So, if you're in a hurry you can definitely bust through your hair a little bit faster that way.\n\nAnd the curl, I will say, the biggest difference to me is the feel of the curl. This is a flat, smooth curl and this is more of a puffy, big curl. You can see, then, if I were to make it even more puffy.

Even in Kazakhstan it is only spoken by 64% of the population, while almost all Kazakhstanis speak Russian. This is why Kazakhstan is often considered a bilingual country. Because of the universal usage throughout the country, Russian is even referred to as the country's official language. Kazakh uses a Cyrillic alphabet, which you will notice immediately after arriving, similar to that used in Russian. As Russian can be heard around the world, those expats relocating to Kazakhstan who are interested in learning the language will enroll in a Russian language course rather than a Kazakh course. English is not yet widely spoken so learning the Cyrillic alphabet, basic phrases, your address, and how to count in either of the local languages will help you transition into your new home.\n\nBe a part of our Astana expat community on facebook:  http://www.facebook.com/kazakh.expat.guide\n\nBe a part of our Astana expat community on facebook:  http://www.facebook.com/kazakh.expat.guide\n\nIf you are an expatriate, you will definitely enjoy our city guide videos http://www.expateye.com\n\nMove One is dedicated to providing seamless services for all aspects of international relocation.

(Faut-il Croire les Mimes sur Parole?)\n68 mins, 2003\nWith humour and poetry, an actor-lecturer-demonstrator-illusionist brings back to life the figures of Livius Andronicus, Harlequin, Jean-Gaspard Debureau's Pierrot in \"Les Enfants du Paradis\", Chaplin's Tramp and Marcel Marceau's Bip. For an instant, he summons up Etienne Decroux's mobile statuary, Jean-Louis Barrault's 'total actor', or Jacque Lecoq's buffoon.\n\nIvan Bacciocchi will take up the challenge to embody all of these apparitions. Equipped only with an odd suitcase he will, with verve, revive twenty-five centuries of theatre and mime history.\n\nFor a reflection on the history of mime from antiquity to the present day, a demonstrator was necessary, or rather a storyteller, able to recount both the grand and the seemingly insignificant histories of mime in a playful and passionate way.\n\nA mime accustomed to the difficult techniques of the Commedia dell'arte, of pantomime and to the particularly rigorous techniques of Etienne Decroux was necessary. An actor able to imitate the greats of silent film and to slip into the codes governing clowning or mask work was necessary. The Theatre du Mouvement found Ivan Bacciocchi, mime, actor, improviser, professor.\n\nDisk 2: Under The White Mask (Blancs... sous le masque)\n111 mins, 2004\nUnder The White Mask is the second part of a diptych on the history of mime, following Should We Take Mimes at Their Word? It is a dramaturgy conceived as an ongoing dialogue between narrators, jesters and the historical figures of mime: the \"whites\".\n\nFrom the Etruscans, medieval jesters, clowns, contemporary design buffoons, Jacques Lecoq or carnival tradition, they are a popular expression, anarchic, funny, and cruel, and they have a political dimension. They are the antidote to academism and didacticism. They utter at the same time one thing and its opposite. They are like a breath, a smile- sometimes grinning and terrifying - but always an invitation to reflect on Theatre, Mime, Stage and more generally, memory, knowledge and truth. They are the colour when the white mime is too white. These noisy buffoons are juxtaposed against the traditional silence of white mimes, whose whiteness is complete, allowing them to disappear and reappear. They invite us to reflect on silence, on forbidden speech, mutism, autism, the unspoken unnameable, the subtext which needs not be voiced. The tension between these two types of physical actors articulates a dialogue between body and words, sensory experience and intellect.\n\nDVD, PAL\nYear 2004\nLength 179 mins\nDVD available from\nEurope, UK: http://www.artfilms.co.uk/Detail.aspx?ItemID=4764\nUS, Australia, World: http://www.artfilms.com.au/Detail.aspx?ItemID=5037\nSTREAMING: http://www.artfilms-digital.com", "title": "Mime's Great and Small Stories - Screener", "publishedDate": "2013-03-25T18:18:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "9orD-VKKdGA", "description": "Facing probate after the loss of a loved one in Sacramento? We can help. Call the Chubb Law Firm at (916) 241-9661 for immediate assistance. \n\nHow to File Probate In Sacramento County With the Sacramento Superior Court | Sacramento Probate Attorney \n\nI'm Heather Chubb and I'm an Estate Planning and Probate attorney, and I've had several people ask me lately whether it is possible to file probate without using an attorney.\n\nI wanted to address that question and the answer is yes, maybe you could. \n\nSo, how do you start a probate in Sacramento County? \n\nIt first starts with filing a petition with the Sacramento Superior Court and that petition has to be on a special form provided by the court. You can get those forms online provided by the judicial council, they're called judicial council forms. \n\nYou'll fill out that petition and it's kind of a check the box but there is a lot of information that goes into it.\n\nSome of the information that you need to know is the date the person died, where did they die, who are their beneficiaries, if they had a will, or heirs if they don't, how old are they, where do they live, all that goes in along with the value of the property that the deceased person left. \n\nThat is the value of both real property and personal property.  All that goes in and then you are going to file that with the court. \n\nIt then needs to be served on all the beneficiaries and heirs and then there needs to be a public notice and all the notice requirements are identified in the probate code.\n\nOnce you file your petition the court is going to set it for a hearing, that hearing is going to be in about anywhere between 30 and 45 days, it might even be 60 days depending on how clogged the courts are. \n\nAt the hearing the judge is either going to approve or deny your petition. But ahead of the hearing you'll have the opportunity to find out where the court stands on it as the court puts out what are called probate notes which, are online.  That's just starting the process.\n\nOnce the court approves your petition for probate, it starts the whole process.  \n\nIt's giving the executor or personal representative or administrator authority to do what they need to do which is to gather up and take control of the assets, figure out what the debts of the deceased are, figure out who the beneficiaries are, figure out who gets what, and have all the legal authority to do that and finally distribute the assets. \n\nBut before assets can ever be distributed the creditors need to be identified and they need to paid and you need to get the court's approval every step of the way. \n\nSo, while you could do a probate yourself there are a lot of technical issues that need to be addressed and if you ever need any help doing that we are available to help people with the probate process and become your attorney.", "title": "Sacramento Superior Court: How to Start a Probate", "publishedDate": "2011-09-22T23:01:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "9orIk_EOcaQ", "description": "Now in its 35th year, This Old House television is back for another exciting season.

I can be a few feet away from the suet cake sitting on the swing and they will come right up and start chomping on the suet while I'm there.\n\nThe Downy Woodpecker, Picoides pubescens, is the smallest woodpecker in North America. Adults are mainly black on the upper parts and wings, with a white back, throat and belly and white spotting on the wings. There is a white bar above the eye and one below. They have a black tail with white outer feathers barred with black. Adult males have a red patch on the back of the head.\n\nDowny Woodpeckers forage on trees, picking the bark surface in summer and digging deeper in winter. They mainly eat insects, also seeds and berries. In winter, especially, Downy Woodpeckers can often be found in treed suburban backyards and will feed on suet at birdfeeders.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downy_Woodpecker\n\nThe background music is used with Thanks from freesound.org and the user billcanada\nhttp://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=17881", "title": "Downy Woodpecker on Suet Cake", "publishedDate": "2009-10-12T23:35:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ows3S9bz8U", "description": "Further Reading:\n\nEmons, Moritz, et al. \"Two-photon polymerization technique with sub-50 nm resolution by sub-10 fs laser pulses.\"\nhttp://www.opticsinfobase.org/viewmedia.cfm?uri=ome-2-7-942&seq=0\n\nThe special characteristics of ultrashort laser pulses, their high peak powers - with relatively low average power - enable material processing techniques to enter previously inaccessible areas. An interesting use for such pulses is the two-photon polymerization (2PP). In recent years 2PP allowed for the generation of functional structures in the sub-micron range, but so far minimum pulse durations of comparatively long 50 fs have been used therefor. Within the scope of this thesis, the use of sub-10-fs pulses will be investigated concerning their influence on the 2PP structure size.\nFor this purpose, a non-collinear optical-parametric amplifier (NOPA) is used to realize pulses with durations of less than 10 fs, pulse energies of several hundred nanojoules and high repetition rates of 1MHz in the NIR spectral range.\nThe special feature of this system is the use of a thin YAG plate for white light generation and just a single amplification stage. This represents an innovative and compact laser source for the generation of ultrashort laser pulses with large pulse energies at high pulse repetition rates.\nThis ultra-short laser pulses are used for the 2PP technology and extensively studied in terms of their potential for the reduction of the reachable feature size. The 2PP-technology uses a locally limited chemical reaction induced by two-photon absorption in photosensitive materials to modify the material just around the focal spot of the laser radiation. By using a novel polymer material and ultrashort laser pulses, this process allows for the generation of structure sizes with lateral dimensions of only 50 nm.

Predicting directions in which the newcomers would settle, he moved barefoot and unarmed through the Indian land. The natives thought of him as one of their own and called him a medicine man. But what happened when there was not enough space for both the Indians and the settlers?\n\nThe main characters in our film are modern day Johnny Appleseeds. Bill Jones, a fund development consultant, has spent fifteen years building an amphitheater in the Ohio wilderness, in order to put on a play about Johnnys life. Hank Ruppertsberger, a New Hampshire high school principal, spent an entire summer walking from Massachusetts to Indiana, along the Appleseed trails. As a young processing engineer at a Silicon Valley company, John Kolling decided to quit it all and grow apples.\n\nWhile following their stories, we learn about our main character - however controversial, it turns out that Johnny Appleseed was an entrepreneur and a visionary.\n\nFind out more on www.filmostovje.com", "title": "Searching for Johnny - the documentary", "publishedDate": "2009-09-09T18:50:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ox1Oht3vVo", "description": "Micro-computertomography of a polychaete worm (done with a SkyScan 1172 at the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research, Heraklion, Crete).", "title": "MicroCT- scan of Hediste diversicolor (Polychaeta)", "publishedDate": "2012-01-16T06:34:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ox6CVO7EWo", "description": "http://www.suspicious0bservers.org/premium\nWhat is the Premium Content?

He sits behind a desk with a message\".\n\n\"He has a black background which is presumably a device being used by IS because they do not want to give clues as to his current whereabouts\".The captive said: \"I know what your thinking. 'He's only doing this because he's a prisoner.\"\n\nAt this point he raises his right hand and puts two fingers to his head, imitating a gun.\n\nHe said: \"He's got a gun at his head and he's being forced to do this - right?'\n\n\"Well, it's true. I am a prisoner, that I cannot deny. But seeing as I've been abandoned by my government and my fate now lies in the hands of the Islamic State, I have nothing to lose.\n\n\"Maybe I will live, maybe I will die. But I want to take this opportunity to convey some facts that you can verify. Facts that if you contemplate might help preserving lives.\"Over the next few programmes I am going to show you the truth as the western media tries to drag the public back to the abyss of another war with the Islamic State.\n\n\"After two disastrous and hugely unpopular wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, why is it our governments appear so keen to get involved in yet another unwinnable conflict?\"\n\n\"I'm going to show you the truth behind the systems and motivation of the Islamic State and how the western media...can twist and manipulate that truth for the public back home. They are two sides to every story. Think you're getting the whole picture. \"\n\nHe ended by saying: \"Join me for the next few programmes and I think you maybe surprised by what you learn.\"\n\nForeign Secretary Philip Hammond said he had heard reports of a video on social media and said authorities would look closely at any material released online.\n\n\"These videos can be very distressing for the families of the individuals involved,\" he told reporters during a visit to Copenhagen.\n\nSecurity expert Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones told Sky News: \"It does sound like they (the militants) are finding another tactical means of putting across a message designed to divide, instil fear and keep their profile up, while not engaging in another execution.\"", "title": "Isis Releases Video Of British Hostage John Cantlie", "publishedDate": "2014-09-18T17:39:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pAWrmuCMME", "description": "Learn about RSNA's Radiology Cares: the Art of Patient-centered Practice campaign, which encourages and facilitates radiologists' meaningful engagement in the patient experience.

We specialize in the treatment of foot pain and disorders of the feet and ankles.\n\nToday I will be talking about what a chiropodist does:\n\nChiropody or podiatry is a branch of medical science that involves the assessment and management of foot and lower limb disorders. This includes the management of a wide variety of disorders, injuries and local manifestations of systemic conditions. Foot deformities, infections and injuries not only limit your mobility, but can detrimentally affect your knees, hips and other parts of the body.\n\nA chiropodist or a podiatrist is a primary care professional practicing in podiatric medicine that specializes in assessment, management and prevention of diseases and disorders of the foot. An essential member of the inter professional healthcare team, the Chiropodist or podiatrist is skilled in assessing the needs of their patients and of managing both chronic and acute conditions affecting foot and lower limb function. As a primary care provider capable of independent clinical practice, these skills are often practiced independent of medical referral and medical supervision.\n\nThe role of the chiropodist and podiatrist is to maintain and improve patient mobility, to alleviate foot pain, provide health education and thereby improving one's quality of life. Doctors of podiatric medicine, chiropodists and podiatrists provide care to a diverse range of patients and can specialize in the following areas:\n\n- Biomechanical and Gait Analysis\n- Podiatric Soft Tissue Surgery\n- Sport Injuries\n- Diabetic Care\n- Pediatrics\n- Geriatrics\n- Rheumatology\n- Wound Care\n\nIf you are experiencing foot pain, consider calling our Ottawa Foot Clinic and talk to one of our chiropodists. We provide comprehensive exams and state of the art treatment options in a comfortable, world-class environment. Our convenient parking facility is free of charge.

For centuries, amber has been enjoyed for its beautiful color and natural charm and regarded throughout many regions of the planet as a natural healing agent.\n\nThe healing power of amber is attributed to the fact that it contains eight per cent \u201csuccinate\u201d, a mild but important chemical substance within every person's cells that improves health and rate of metabolism. \n\nSo how do Baltic amber teething necklaces work?  Well, when the amber teething necklace contacts your baby\u2019s skin, the warmth generated by this contact causes the beads to secrete small levels of the succinic acid which are absorbed into the body. \n\nBecause the succinic acid acts as a natural pain reliever, when it enters the bloodstream it lessens the acute pain, puffiness and drooling that come with the teething process and has a soothing effect on your baby which will help little one and mom get back to a much more normal lifestyle.\n\nWhen selecting an amber teething necklace, be sure you choose one that has been designed with your baby's safety in mind.  It ought to have both a secure clasp to keep it from coming loose together with \u201csafety knotting\u201d in between each of the amber beads to keep the beads from going everywhere in the unlikely event that the necklace is broken.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to check out our Baltic amber teething necklace, visit us at http://www.amazon.com/Baltic-Amber-Teething-Necklace-Toogli/dp/B00KPEAFTC", "title": "Baltic Amber Teething Necklaces - How Do They Work?", "publishedDate": "2014-08-25T15:51:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pSh0VAVYn4", "description": "", "title": "SouthPark ''Vote or Die'' HD Clip", "publishedDate": "2014-03-09T23:03:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pSvtf__CHo", "description": "Get Out There Reporter, Craig Cassar, was on the Trails in the Dundas Valley Conversation Area for the 20th anniversary Sulphur Springs Trail Run.

This is also the home of Fabricworm.com. Hi, I'm Melissa Lunden; I'm the resident seamstress here at Birch Fabrics. I teach sewing lessons here, prepare blog tutorials and sew samples of Birch's line of organic cotton. And I am here today to talk to you about sewing. Hi, we're going to talk about how to sew a machine buttonhole. And if you have a newer machine that comes with programmed settings like mine, it's so easy. And what you're going to do is check your manual and it's going to show you how to do it. The quick and dirty way is you're going to take your machine buttonhole foot, you're going to swap that out for the regular one that you have, then you are going to take your button that you have, and you're going to place it in the back piece that slides, and when you put your button in there, nice and firmly so it doesn't fall out, this tells the machine how wide your buttonhole needs to be. So then you put your presser foot in, lock it in, and drop this little lever down. This has a little symbol for a buttonhole and it needs to be positioned behind this little white tab. We're going to take this scrap piece of fabric, and you always want to do a test buttonhole before you do anything on your finished garment because it's a lot of stitching and taking it out is going to make a big mess. So what your machine is doing is creating two very narrow, very tight zigzag stitches. And then it's also sewing stitches across the top and bottom and that's how it creates the buttonhole. So what you're going to do once you're in the right position, press your foot and it's going to start going. So it's all finished. I'm going to lift up my needle. And then you can see my button hole. But you're not quite finished. What you are going to do is trim the extra threads, and then with a pair of scissors or an X-Acto knife, which is my preference, you're going to very slowly cut open the buttonhole between the 2 rows of stitches, being careful not to cut through the ends and then there's your buttonhole. And then the last step is to use a little Fray Check. It's a little chemical solution that helps keep your fabric from fraying and it will keep those little threads from fraying as you use your buttonhole. And you're all done.", "title": "How to Sew a Machine Buttonhole | Sewing Lessons", "publishedDate": "2011-05-31T21:13:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pUsBm1Bjy4", "description": "http://kaseyesser.blogspot.com\n\nGet more range of motion on your T-Bar Rows by using a rope attachment.", "title": "T-Bar Row w/ Rope", "publishedDate": "2012-03-31T15:26:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pVbiQyvxbY", "description": "clay things episode 1 rainbow worm", "title": "clay things episode 1 rainbow worm", "publishedDate": "2011-01-02T02:51:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pWC-4dx3Q0", "description": "Return the Slab or suffer my curse.", "title": "Return the Slab", "publishedDate": "2011-12-30T22:50:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pWC5MpbU-E", "description": "Duello tra combattenti durante il campo dei mercenari della Compagnia \"Aper Labronicus\" - 30 giugno 2013", "title": "Aper Labronicus -  Duello - Sutri 30/06/2013", "publishedDate": "2013-07-01T08:56:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pWIy0_mWjs", "description": "From The Donny & Marie Talk Show. 9/22/1999.", "title": "Marie Osmond & Victoria Principal On Andy Gibb", "publishedDate": "2013-11-21T02:39:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pWkGnNcjSM", "description": "Heavy rains on Friday afternoon closed some small streets", "title": "Low Water Crossings at Risk", "publishedDate": "2013-09-21T03:43:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pWktH0zPz0", "description": "", "title": "Studies in Occultism", "publishedDate": "2013-02-20T23:42:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pWoY8p2YsI", "description": "A large semi-longhair cat, the Siberian came from a harsh environment, evolving on the streets of St Petersburg and the farms of rural Russia.

He instead set out to capture his longtime stomping grounds when his wife came home with a framed photograph of Waimea shorebreak, an image he figured he would be able to easily replicate. Having never owned a camera, he threw a cheap \"waterproof\" casing over a cheaper point-and-shoot and headed out to the beach.

The installation is a contemporary example of how the arbitrary boundaries of fine and decorative art, design and utility are no longer of immediate aesthetic relevance. An apparently inanimate object, 'Swarm' unites crucial aspects of rAndom international's continued experimentation with light, behavioural responses and interactive spatial environments.\nThe viewers' presence creates a soundscape that directly alters the behaviour of the entire environment surrounding 'Swarm Light'. Human presence brings a basic form of artificial intelligence to life. Sounds or movement captured as light and shadow create a type of participatory and performative syn\u00e6sthesia that culminates in an instinctual perception of the space, rather than a cerebral judgement.\nrAndom was founded by Stuart Wood, Flo Ortkrass and Hannes Koch in 2002. The studio was set up to extend the perspective of contemporary practice. Working from the fringes of art, design, science and architecture, rAndom are developing projects and installations that re-interpret the 'cold' nature of digital-based work and emphasise the interaction between the animate (audience) and the inanimate (object), bringing the two into a powerful relationship of performance.\nThe studio's work has won many awards in the fields art, architecture and design over the past few years. In 2009 their interactive 'Audience' installation received an Honorable Mention at Prix Ars Electronica and the Observer recognized rAndom among the top ten UK designers in 2007. rAndom has won several diverse awards, including: the iF Design award in 2006 and in 2005; the Wallpaper design award, 2006 and the Creative Futures Award, 2005.\nMore info: http://www.random-international.com/", "title": "rAndom International - Swarm Light, Responsive Light Installation 2010", "publishedDate": "2010-06-18T10:10:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pagkAW5aKc", "description": "Russian Girl On Motorcycle Delivers Justice To People Who Litter (VIDEO) Russian Girl On Motorcycle Delivers Justice To People Who Litter (VIDEO) Russian Girl On Motorcycle Delivers Justice.\n\nGirl vs littering : Russian Motorcycle Chick Delivers Street Justice To People Who Litter!

Puede afectar tanto a los beb\u00e9s como a los ni\u00f1os, a los adultos o a los ancianos. A menudo las causas derivan de una mala alimentaci\u00f3n, carente de los nutrientes esenciales para el organismo.\n\nTambi\u00e9n las deficiencias nutricionales pueden deberse a la incapacidad org\u00e1nica para absorber los nutrientes, como sucede con la enfermedad cel\u00edaca. O las causas pueden provenir de est\u00edmulos que afectan una piel hipersensible, como ciertas alergias. \n\nO se puede producir por ciertos medicamentos. O incluso por pr\u00f3tesis dentarias mal ajustadas. Y la queilitis puede agravarse en una persona que padece micosis como la C\u00e1ndida albicans.\n\nLo cierto es que la boca es una zona h\u00fameda, condici\u00f3n que dificulta la cura e incluso aumenta las manifestaciones nocivas en la piel y en la membrana que tapiza la cavidad interior de la boca.

Elle a aussi remport\u00e9e une Coupe des Nations avec l'\u00e9quipe de France junior en Italie. \nUn travail quotidien\nJustine explique : \u00ab Il faut beaucoup de qualit\u00e9s pour un cheval, surtout en concours complet qui associe toutes les \u00e9preuves. On se rend compte de ces qualit\u00e9s tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t. Il lui faut aussi une bonne sant\u00e9, de grandes qualit\u00e9s morales, l'envie de se bagarrer... et que \u00e7a lui plaise. S'il n'\u00e9prouve aucun plaisir dans ce qu'il fait, \u00e7a ne marchera pas. Mon cheval depuis quatre ans, Newton, est n\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison. Mon histoire est donc 100% Doubs ! Maintenant que nous nous connaissons bien avec Newton, nous abordons les parcours de cross et d'obstacles internationaux avec confiance. La gestion du cheval, lors des concours complet est tr\u00e8s importante pour qu'il puisse bien enchainer les trois \u00e9preuves, bien r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer sans risquer pour sa sant\u00e9. Les contr\u00f4les v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires sont d'ailleurs syst\u00e9matiques. L'\u00e9quitation, c'est un entrainement quotidien. Le cheval en a besoin et notre discipline n\u00e9cessite une mise au point fine. D'ailleurs, la moyenne d'\u00e2ge de la discipline aux JO tourne autour des 30 ans. \u00bb\nPour la petite histoire, ce 20 avril, Justine et Newton ont gagn\u00e9 l'\u00e9preuve nationale support et le championnat d\u00e9partemental Amateur 1 Grand Prix. Le lendemain, Justine a aussi gagn\u00e9 l'\u00e9preuve et le championnat d\u00e9partemental AM2 avec Tiloup du Breuil.

The original stone house dates to the 1740s and was built for Grand Duke Mikhail Golitsyn. In 1802, the house was acquired by Nikolay Rumyantsev, son of Ekaterina Golitsyna and was reconstructed. The architect, Vasily Glinka retained the proportions of the original building, but completely changed the appearance of the facade, which was decorated with a massive 12-column portico with an elaborate pediment with an alto-relievo of Apollo on Parnassus and other figures. The interior spaces housing  the vast art collection of the Rumyantsev family, becoming, in 1831, a museum, open to the public. In 1861 the whole collection was moved to Moscow and the mansion changed hands several times, in the course of which, was altered by the architect Alexander Stepanov. At the beginning of the 20th century, the mansion passed into the hands of Prince Lev Kotchubey, son-in-law of the Duke of Leuchtenberg, who became the last owner of the mansion. It is from this time that the photographs were taken. In 1916 the mansion was again sold and was almost certain to be demolished. The 1917 Revolution stopped this from occurring. \nIn 1938, the mansion was gifted to the Museum of the History and Development of Leningrad, which until then had been housed in the Anichkov Palace. Restoration of the state rooms was carried out in 2003. It is now home to a branch of the Museum of the History of St. Petersburg .\n\nMusic: The Ist movement of the Violin Concerto in A Minor by Glazunov", "title": "Imperial Russian Interiors: 2 - The House of Prince Lev M.

To acquire the just basic rights for the people of Mianwali, Tehreek Haqooq-e-Mianwali (THM) was framed by the all walks of life including common people, local politicians, Traders, Transporters, Students, Women, Farmers, Nazims, Councilors, and even children participated in this just cause Movement.\nIn speeches at Jahaz Chowk Mianwali all leaders spoken against the discrimination of Governments of all parties of Pakistan towards the Mianwalian. In this rally which was peaceful it was said that people of Mianwali are sacrificing for the progress & development of Pakistan but in return government gave nothing except poverty, gift of New Jail (PRISON) in front of Government Degree College, Mianwali which means students of Mianwalian are being told that yours future is Jail (PRISON) instead of University. In front of a college a New \"University of Mianwali\", Medical College, Engineering College, Agriculture College, and Women University, suit on such precious land of Mianwali but Government of Pakistan is constructing a latest Jail (PRISON) which shows the discriminatory attitude of government of Pakistan towards the innocent people, children women, farmers, and laborers of Mianwalian. Many speakers spoken the facts that Mianwali is District from 1901 and providing precious land ,mines of salt,coal,cement, fertilizers, power generation on Jinnah & Chasma barrage (500 megs watts) and at Nuclear Plant Chasma Mianwali (600 mega watts ) is being generated for the country and not single mega watts is being given to the Mianwali. But in response to these sacrifices Government of Pakistan giving them the gift of New Jail in front of theirs children's college. A great numbers of manpower is serving in Army and Police for the defense of Pakistan and also gave many precious lives for the cause to fight against terrorisms and for the defense of Pakistan. People of Mianwali are loyal to Pakistan and many people participated in Pakistan Movement in 1940-1947 but these founders & freedom fighters of Pakistan are being awarded bullets and tear gases on their just rally for demonstration for royalty on Electricity, provision of higher Institutions for Higher Education needed for people of Mianwali demand University, Medical College, Engineering College, Agriculture College and Women University. They spoken that Mianwali is the poorest district of Pakistan and this was observed by a neutral NGO's survey conducted recently. They pointed that Mianwali is being intentionally kept behind in development of manpower and area by the government of every political party when they came in power. It is peak of discrimination towards the people of Mianwali that railway train \"Mianwali Express\" which runs from Mianwali to Lahore is such old type trains remember the 200 years ago train without any lights, water and seats but hire is taken on full.\n               They demanded Mianwali should be free from any load shedding, royalty of electricity, University of Mianwali, Medical College, Engineering College, Agriculture College, Woman University and Motorway link from Bilkassar to Mianwali, then to Sargodha, Multan and Indus High Way. Mianwali is being kept cut off from country intentionally since in Hills of Mosa Khel pass is not being constructed due to which heavy vehicles and passengers pass through dangerous way and every week a serious accident happened. Although Mianwali is mid point for joining the all province transport from Karachi to Khyber, Balochistan and Afghanistan. Mianwali will be the back bone of Pakistan's economy from aspects of mines, power, manpower, transport, seaport through Indus River' canalization from Karachi to Kalabagh could be ship ways for goods transportation to Afghanistan and far countries which will earn toll for Pakistan.", "title": "Tehreek Haqooq e Mianwali -Arif Azeem Khan speech 4th July,2011, Jahaz Chowk", "publishedDate": "2011-07-04T14:55:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pyA5xPZnvc", "description": "Steve Walker, founder of Sculling Academy, http://scullingacademy.com, crashes dramatically while sculling on the River Dee in his Wintech single scull.", "title": "CRASH on River Dee - Steve Walker - Sculling Academy founder", "publishedDate": "2013-11-12T21:46:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "9pyMuM64Erk", "description": "animais, engra\u00e7ados, fofinhos, cachorro, gato, papagaio, leao, zebra, cavalo, periquito, engra\u00e7ado,\nengracado, louco, luta, doidao, doido, assustador, dramatico, drama, cute, dog, cat, bird, cracatoa, \njoke, funny, fun, crazy, craziest, fight, fighter, ninja, maluco, doidon, sexy, sexiest, macacos, gorila, \nmacaco, peido, fedor, desmaia, desmaio, castor, pet, \n\nlista de animais\n\nanimais em extin\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nnomes de animais\n\nanimais selvagens\n\nanimais vertebrados\n\nanimais frases\n\njogos\n\ncavalos\n\nstrange animals\n\nrare animals\n\ncool animals\n\nunique animals\n\ncrazy animal names\n\ncrazy animal facts\n\ninteresting animals\n\ncrazy animals found\n\nfunny cute animals pictures\n\ncute animals list\n\ncute animals pictures\n\ncute animals wallpapers\n\ncute animals videos\n\ncute animals tumblr\n\ncute animals names\n\ncute animals youtube\n\nSearches related to animais fofinhos\n\npicasa web albums animais fofinhos\n\nanimais fofinhos photos\n\nCachorro violento e dono n\u00e3o cuida me ajudem ...\u200e - 11 answers - 15 Jan 2012\nCachorro violento na minha rua, o que fazer?\u200e - 7 answers - 25 Oct 2011\nExiste uma ra\u00e7a de cachorro mais violenta que a do ...\u200e - 27 answers - 14 Aug 2010\nUM HUSKY SIBERIANO \u00c9 UM CACHORRO ..\n\nAfghan Hound  Airedale Terrier  Akbash Dog\nAkita Inu  American Pitbull  Australian Cattle\nAustralian Shepherd  Basenji  Basset Fulvo\nBasset Griffon  Basset Hound  Beagle\nBearded Collie  Bernese Mountain Dog  Bichon Fris\u00c9\nBichon Havan\u00cas  Bloodhound  Border Collie\nBorzoi  Boston Terrier  Bouvier de Flandres\nBoxer  Braco Alem\u00c3o  Braco Italiano\nBriard  BULDOGUE CAMPEIRO  Bull Terrier\nBulldog  Bulldog Franc\u00cas  Bullmastiff\nCairn Terrier  Cane Corso Italiano  C\u00c3o D'\u00c1gua Portugu\u00cas\nCavalier King Charles  Chihuahua  Chow Chow\nCimarr\u00d3n Uruguayo  Clumber Spaniel  Cocker Americano\nCocker SPANIEL Ingl\u00cas  Collie  Coton de Tul\u00c9ar\nCristado Chin\u00cas  Cuvac  D\u00c1lmata\nDobermann  Dogo Argentino  Dogue Alem\u00c3o\nDogue de Bordeaux  Fila Brasileiro  Flat Coated Retriever\nFox Terrier Pelo Duro  Fox Terrier Pelo Liso  Foxhound Ingl\u00cas\nGolden Retriever  Husky Siberiano  Jack Russel Terrier\nKeeshond  Kerry Blue Terrier  Komondor\nKuvasz  Labrador RETRIEVER  Lhasa Apso\nMalt\u00caS  Mameremmano  Mastiff\nMastim do Tibete  Mastim Espanhol  Mastino Napoletano\nNova Scotia D.

MASINT was recognized as a formal intelligence discipline in 1986.[2] Another way to describe MASINT is a \"non-literal\" discipline. It feeds on a target's unintended emissive by-products, the \"trails\" - the spectral, chemical or RF that an object leaves behind. These trails form distinct signatures, which can be exploited as reliable discriminators to characterize specific events or disclose hidden targets.\"[3]\n\nAs with many branches of MASINT, specific techniques may overlap with the six major conceptual disciplines of MASINT defined by the Center for MASINT Studies and Research, which divides MASINT into Electro-optical, Nuclear, Geophysical, Radar, Materials, and Radiofrequency disciplines", "title": "Geo Engineering Orange County, CA 5/22/2011 Electromagnetic Silver Haze  and a Parhelic Circle", "publishedDate": "2011-05-23T23:39:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "9q5emx5OtGc", "description": "Hola, saludos, les comento que este ensayo fue hecho en suiza, en La ciudad universitaria de Neuch\u00e2tel, Su particular atm\u00f3sfera est\u00e1 marcada por el centro hist\u00f3rico medieval y por la iglesia colegial del siglo XII, este ensayo fue una semana antes de ir a cantar al encuentro del papa juan pablo II con todos los jovenes del mundo en el jubileo.", "title": "SOCRATES CARIACO ensayando con los Adolescentes Orquesta - Gracias A La Vida, de violeta parra", "publishedDate": "2013-04-18T15:11:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "9q5g7Y3C5nk", "description": "http://www.blackholerecordings.com/music/albums/tiesto-traffic/\n\nSubscribe to Black Hole Recordings TV: \u202ahttp://bit.ly/SubscribeToYoutube\u202c\nSpotify: \u202ahttp://bit.ly/BlackHoleSpotify\u202c\nFacebook: \u202ahttps://www.facebook.com/blackholerecordings\u202c\nTwitter: \u202ahttp://twitter.com/BlackHoleRec\u202c", "title": "Ti\u00ebsto - Traffic (Official Music Video)", "publishedDate": "2009-06-12T10:20:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "9q6V_aTq1oI", "description": "MAMADO NO CHAO, CENSURADA E LEGENDADA.\nmusica da banda mamaki, mamado no ch\u00e3o.\nmais musicas e informa\u00e7oes em:\nhttp://www.myspace.com/b.mamaki\nhttps://www.facebook.com/banda.mamaKi\nhttp://letras.terra.com.br/mamaki/mamado-no-chao/", "title": "MAMAKI (CENSURADO) MAMADO NO CH\u00c3O!! cuiDADO!!!

BM stands for boyevaya mashina, combat vehicle, and the nickname grad means hail. In the West, the system was initially known as M1964. Several other countries have copied it or developed similar systems.\n\nThe BM-21 122 mm multiple rocket launcher (MRL) system entered service with the Soviet Army in 1963 to replace the aging 140 mm BM-14 system. It consists of a Ural-375D six-by-six truck chassis fitted with a bank of 40 launch tubes arranged in a rectangular shape that can be turned away from the unprotected cab. The vehicle is powered by a water-cooled V-8 180 hp gasoline engine, has a maximum road speed of 75 km/h, road range of up to 750 kilometers, and can cross fords up to 1.5 m deep. The original vehicle together with supporting equipment (including the re-supply truck 9T254 with 60 rockets) is referred to by the GRAU index 9K51; the launcher itself has the industrial index of 2B5. In 1976, the BM-21 was mounted on the newer Ural-4320 six-by-six army truck.\nBM-21, side view.\n\nThe crew of five men can emplace the system and have it ready to fire in three minutes. The crew can fire the rockets from the cab or from a trigger at the end of a 64-meter cable. All 40 rockets can be away in as little as 20 seconds, but can also be fired individually or in small groups in several-second intervals. A PG-1M panoramic telescope with K-1 collimator can be used for sighting. The BM-21 can be packed up and ready to move in two minutes, which can be necessary when engaged by counter-battery fire. Reloading is done manually and takes about 10 minutes.\n\nEach 2.87-meter rocket is slowly spun by rifling in its tube as it exits, which along with its primary fin stabilization keeps it on course. Rockets armed with high explosive/fragmentation, incendiary, or chemical warheads can be fired 20 kilometers. Newer high explosive and cargo (used to deliver anti-personnel or antitank mines) rockets have a range of 30 kilometers and more. Warheads weigh around 20 kilograms, depending on the type.\n\nThe relative accuracy of this system and the number of rockets each vehicle is able to quickly bring to bear on an enemy target make it effective, especially at shorter ranges. One battalion of eighteen launchers is able to deliver 720 rockets in a single volley.", "title": "English Documentary about -BM 21 Grad Rocket Launcher", "publishedDate": "2009-07-22T20:21:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qAeIY_oE0E", "description": "", "title": "Jump off @ Southview EC - Pony Club winter league - Ceri Jones & Nantrhos Corylus", "publishedDate": "2013-11-09T16:37:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qArURfXOKA", "description": "Dr. James Duke singing about the Jimson Weed on May 28, 2011 at the Green Farmacy Garden in Maryland.", "title": "Dr. James Duke, Jimson Weed.MOV", "publishedDate": "2011-06-08T00:47:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qAtcNoHpAI", "description": "Conoce los s\u00edntomas de la insuficiencia renal y c\u00f3mo se puede diagnosticar.", "title": "Insuficiencia renal, s\u00edntomas y diagn\u00f3stico", "publishedDate": "2012-04-09T20:36:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qB-U5x_THs", "description": "", "title": "How To Deal With Chromatic Aberration In Lightroom", "publishedDate": "2013-04-01T18:15:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qB6tYamFbg", "description": "I got tagged to do this Lou Gehrig Challenge thing by my sister, Jennifer.

SUBSCRIBE for thousands more live videos and new gigs uploaded weekly: http://www.youtube.com/moshcam\n\nEmilie Autumn Liddell was born in Los Angeles, California, better known by her stage name Emilie Autumn, is an American singer-songwriter, poet, and violinist. Autumn draws influence for her music\u2014the style of which she has alternatively labeled as \"Victoriandustrial\" and glam rock\u2014from plays, novels, and history, particularly the Victorian era. Performing with her all-female backing band The Bloody Crumpets, Autumn incorporates elements of classical music, cabaret, electronica, and glam rock with theatrics, burlesque, and \"flamboyant\" outfits. Outspoken about bipolar disorder and her experience in a modern-day psychiatric ward, she has written an autobiographical novel, 2010's The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls.\n\nHer music encompasses a wide range of styles. Autumn's vocal range registers from contralto to dramatic soprano, and her vocal work has been compared to Tori Amos, Kate Bush, and The Creatures. She has released two instrumental albums (On a Day... and Laced/Unlaced), and three which feature her vocals: Enchant, Opheliac, and A Bit o' This &amp; That. The 2003 album Enchant drew on \"new age chamber music, trip-hop baroque, and experimental space pop\". Autumn layers her voice frequently, and incorporates electronics and electronic effects into her work on Enchant; she also combines strings and piano for some songs, while others feature mainly the piano or violin. The 2006 release Opheliac featured \"cabaret, electronic, symphonic, new age, and good ol' rock &amp; roll (and heavy on the theatrical bombast).\"", "title": "Emilie Autumn - Dominant (Live in Los Angeles) | Moshcam", "publishedDate": "2013-02-19T21:54:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qEvcRLCdLs", "description": "http://sutterhealth.org - By reducing hospital-acquired infections, Sutter Health hospitals have saved more than 1,000 lives and reduced healthcare costs by $43 million (from 2007-2010).\nSupported by grants from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, see how Sutter nursing teams are make a difference every day throughout Northern California.\n\nFor more information on our care quality efforts, visit:\nhttp://sutterhealth.org/quality/focus/", "title": "Sutter nurses helping reduce hospital-acquired infections", "publishedDate": "2011-05-02T23:54:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qEyFApqP2A", "description": "NHS teachers respond to the mean tweets about them \n(April 4th, 2014)", "title": "Mean Tweets: Teachers Edition", "publishedDate": "2014-04-24T01:25:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qEz4EbYJtw", "description": "A tutorial using Phillip Tennen's new Acute.", "title": "Acute recognition for iOS", "publishedDate": "2014-07-03T12:51:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qFFJYc-2xM", "description": "Intratissue Percutaneous Electrolysis (EPI\u00ae) technique is a pioneering ultrasound-guided treatment for tendinopathy and muscle injury, developed by Dr. JM Sanchez-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez (PT.PhD).\nEPI\u00ae causes an organic reaction leading to a highly localized pro-inflammatory response.

The classic symptom of the migraine headache is that it is a one-sided headache.\n\nDr. Newman: In general, there are four stages to a migraine attack, the prodrome, the aura, the headache itself, and then the postdrome.  About 60% of patients experience the prodrome although in fact many of them do not realize it.  \n\nProdromal symptoms includes such things as hyperactivity, decreased ability to sleep.  In some people sluggishness or yawning, some people notice they become crabby, they urinate more frequently, they crave certain foods, and often they start to have a heightened awareness of their senses.  \n\nSo, light seem brighter, sound seem stronger, and they start complaining that their family is too louder, or the workplace is too loud when in fact nothing has changed.  They are just more sensitive to it.  \n\nThe second face the aura, and interestingly many doctors and many patients also think you need to have an aura to have migraine headache, but in fact aura is fairly rare.\n\nOnly about 20% of migraine suffers experience the aura, and by definition the aura is a transient or a short lived disturbance in some function in the neurologic ability.  \n\nUsually, it is a visual disturbance so people will see sparkling lights, or shooting stars, or zig zag lines that blot out their vision.  Some people may notice they become numb on their face, or on their hand, on the side around the opposite side of their headache, and still other people may notice they have trouble speaking.  \n\nThe next stage of migraine not surprisingly is the headache, and the classic symptom of the migraine headache is that it is a one-sided headache.  It tends to be throbbing or pounding, moderate to severe in intensity, but it is not just the head pain that makes the headache of migraine a migraine.  \n\nIt is what associated with the headache.  People during migraine experience nausea.  They may vomit, they may have sensitivity to light, or to sound, or to smell, and in fact all they really want to do during a migraine headache is to shut the door, and close the lights, pull the blankets over their head and try to sleep.\n\nIn fact hibernation is one of the features of migraine that is not appropriately treated.  The last stage of migraine is called the postdrome and it is this vague sensation almost like a hangover where your body aches.  You have a limited ability to think, to eat, to act normally, and you are still just not yourself.  \n\nTaken in total, the entire complex of migraine can last as short as four hours which is pretty long to as long as three to four days.  So, it is an overwhelming sensation.  If you suffer from migraine, you are not alone.\n\nMigraine affects about 11% of the country, or more than 30 million Americans.  If you think you are one of those migraine sufferers, you should call your doctor, and if necessary you refer to a neurologist or other headache specialist.\n\nLearn more about Dr. Newman: http://www.einstein.yu.edu/faculty/profile.asp?id=5174", "title": "Symptoms and Stages Of A Migraine", "publishedDate": "2012-11-05T21:37:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qIcYDbLhgo", "description": "A liesure day on Lake Dora turned interesting when a water moccasin invaded my space!

They were just some hippie surfers, high school friends who'd come up with the idea of swimming bundles of marijuana across the border from Tijuana during the summer of 1969. Within a decade, however, the Coronado Company had become the largest pot-smuggling operation on the West Coast, a $100 million empire with outposts from Mexico to Morocco to Thailand. And sitting at the top of it all was the most improbable of kingpins: Lou Villar, a former Spanish teacher and swimming coach at Coronado High School.\n\nDrawing on exclusive interviews with Villar and his partners in crime, Joshuah Bearman\u2014author of the Wired article that became the film Argo\u2014tells the inside story of the Coronado Company's unlikely rise and the intrepid DEA agents who brought its principals to justice. Coronado High is an epic saga of daring escapades, hedonistic excess, and friendships betrayed, played out across the era when the innocence of the Summer of Love curdled into the paranoia of the drug war.\n\nThe iPad/iPhone edition includes exclusive new music from Islands and an audiobook version read by comedian Brett Gelman.\n\nJoshuah Bearman has written for Rolling Stone, Harper's, Wired, McSweeney's, Playboy, GQ, and The New York Times Magazine, and is a contributor to This American Life.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "New 2015 Cadillac ELR ahmed", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T18:24:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qLRis2IOVM", "description": "Please like, subscribe, comment and share!\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/user/DrJohnKiel\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/medicinelifestyle\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/LifestyleMedYou\n\nTobacco use and cigarette smoking has earned a reputation as a major threat to the health of users.

He said Shaykh-ul-Islam was such personality who was uniting Umma on a single platform as well as spreading the Quranic teachings in the modern way.\n\nDr Jamil-ur-Rahman Chishti of the Chishtia Abad, Kamoki, said that Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadris translation of the Holy Qur`an enlightens the readers with the real spirit of the Holy Book. The unique and lucid style of translation distinguishes Irfan-ul-Qur`an from the existing body of translations. \n\nCentral Amir of Jamat Ahl Hadith, Pakistan, Allama Zubair Ahmad Zaheer said that Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri did full justice to the demands of translation and rendered the translation beautifully by rising above sectarian affiliations. He congratulated Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri for doing translation of the Holy Qur`an for the entire Muslim Umma and all sects. \n\nRenowned scholar Dr Tahir Hameed Tanoli said that if the translations of the Holy Qur`an done in the subcontinent were the tree, Irfan-ul-Qur`an, the translation of the Holy Quran by Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri was its fruit. This translation had the unique quality of an exegesis in terms of its meaningfulness. Shaykh-ul-Islams translation of the Holy Book was a great scholarly feat of the contemporary age from which the Umma would continue to derive benefit for centuries. Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri has made the reverence for the Holy Prophet (saw) the pivot and no where does the translation go away from this.\n\nKhawaja Muin-ud-Din Koraija of Kot Mitthan said that Irfan-ul-Qur`an would continue to be read till the Day of Judgment. Irfan-ul-Qur`an not only removes the doubts and reservations of the modern mind but also offers remedy for the scourge of sectarianism. Our society is engulfed in terrorism. The Islamic message of peace was the dire need of the hour and Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri is known as an ambassador of peace in the entire world. He also declared to hold the inauguration ceremony of Irfan-ul-Qur`an in the annual spiritual celebrations of Kot Mitthan.\n\nPrincipal of Pakistan Law College, Dr Hamayun Ihsan, said in his talk that undertaking the translation of the Holy Qur`an was the most difficult job of the world. Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri deserved felicitation that he did a great favour to the Umma by doing simple, lucid and modern translation of the Holy Qur`an, which is also compatible with the contemporary demands. Dr Ihsan said that if the translations of the quality books were undertaken, it would go a long way in guiding people through a maze of problems. The Umma could regain its lost glory by reading Irfan-ul-Qur`an, for such is its scholarly depth.\n\nShaykh-ul-Hadith Muhammad Mi`raj-ul-Islam said that there were a few translation of the Holy Qur`an, which did not contain the element of reverence and respect. Irfan-ul-Qur`an is such a valuable treasure as removes all doubts and enhances respect for the holy personages.\n\nShaykh-ul-Hadith of Jamea Nizamia, Lahore Maulana Abdut Tawab Siddique said in his speech that there was dire need of reviving our relationship with the holy Quran. This endeavour of Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri really deserves appreciation. His Quranic translation \"Irfan-ul-Quran\" is a became of light for all Muslims.\n\nArab scholars, ash-Shaykh Dr al-Farfur, ash-Shaykh Dr Sayyid Mahmud Abu al-Huda al-Husaini and ash-Shaykh As`ad Muhammad Sa`id as-Sagharji also addressed at the ceremony at the occasion. They said that they could not fully benefit from Irfan-ul-Qur`an because of their ignorance of the Urdu language, which they branded as great deprivation.", "title": "Irfan ul Quran, Sura az-Zalzalah (99) by Shaykh ul Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir ul Qadri", "publishedDate": "2011-08-07T11:42:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qPIwG6x57E", "description": "All Tamilnadu Political Parties Stand on Loksabha Elections - Dinamalar Dec 27th News", "title": "All Tamilnadu Political Parties Stand on Loksabha Elections - Dinamalar Dec 27th News", "publishedDate": "2013-12-27T11:51:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qQ3CBcV5Mc", "description": "Bester Mix ever", "title": "Echter Gangsta \"Ich will UT Spielen!\" REMIX ORIGINAL!!!", "publishedDate": "2011-04-24T18:54:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qQ4anZ9NaM", "description": "Agro-tourism excursion - mastic trees with close-up of \"tears of Chios\" near Kalamoti Village, Chios Island, Greece.  \nhttp://www.meliandperi.com\nhttp://www.meliandperi.com/2012/10/31/learning-about-mastic-cultivation-in-chios/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/meliandperi", "title": "Mastic Trees Chios", "publishedDate": "2012-11-04T18:33:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qQD0bBVxZU", "description": "\"Grab The Mic\" \u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442 \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 \u043d\u0430 Negy -- \u00bd Fars \u00bd Amazing. \u041a\u043b\u0438\u043f\u044a\u0442 \u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0435\u0442, \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d \u043e\u0442 Under 7th Floor -- Digital Media Productions \u0441\u044a\u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0441 Pixelspot. \u0421\u043d\u0438\u043c\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431 * Mixtape5 *.\n\nhttp://www.illmate.com\nhttp://www.itb-onlinemixing.com", "title": "Negy - Grab The Mic (Official HD Video)", "publishedDate": "2013-03-22T12:19:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qQR9lDgBGY", "description": "Reza Baluchi has a dream to run thru all 194 recognized countries in the world to inspire us and unite us as a people.", "title": "Run wuth Reza - Reza Baluchi", "publishedDate": "2009-08-25T05:04:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qQoaOI0dig", "description": "Tuatha Dea performing the traditional classic \"Scotland the Brave\" on St. Patrick's Day 2011 at the Preservation Pub, Knoxville, TN\n\nwww.preservationpub.com\nwww.tuathadea.com", "title": "Tuatha Dea performing \"Scotland the Brave\" at the Preservation Pub", "publishedDate": "2011-09-11T07:03:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qRH8dUOIKM", "description": "This is the first in a 4 part series of presentations on 'How To Use The Mini Mental State Examination' and is intended as a guide and learning resource for aged care service providers. \n\nPart 1 deals with; What is the MMSE and what are it's strengths and weaknesses. \n\nDownload MMSE form here - http://www.mediafire.com/file/y3dggmomzjm/mmse.pdf", "title": "Part 1 - How To Use The Mini Mental State Examination", "publishedDate": "2010-07-11T08:46:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qRmBlm0OAg", "description": "In this song : Larry Lovestein is Mac Miller..

Dutch DJ Dash Berlin is back with a brand new, future classic to add to his hit-filled discography. The debut single from his forthcoming, second artist album is the first glimpse on the exciting things to come.\n \nThe epic anthem entitled 'Disarm Yourself' is the result of his fan-anticipated rendezvous with Australian singer Emma Hewitt and contains an inspiring message. \"I believe it was President Roosevelt who said; \"There is nothing to fear, but fear itself\" and that concept is exactly what this song is about\", says the humble DJ when asked about the lyrical theme on his latest collaboration. \"It's about the anxiety you can feel when you are confronted with the new and the unknown. Sometimes disarming yourself and actually feeling the fear, while doing things anyway, can be the only way forward\".\n \nThe track premiered on episode 486 of Armin van Buuren's legendary ASOT radio show and immediately caused a major stir all around the web. The preview quickly found its way to the fans via Dash Berlin's Youtube channel and gained a massive 160000 views within days after upload. Dash Berlin's eagerly awaited, brand new single with Emma Hewitt is out now exclusively on Beatport.\n\nDash Berlin and Emma Hewitt are donating the proceeds of this single to the Flood Relief Fund in Australia. http://www.qld.gov.au/floods/donate.html\n\nFollow us: \nhttp://www.facebook.com/armadamusic\nhttp://www.dashberlin.com/facebook\nhttp://www.armadamusic.com\nhttp://www.dashberlin.com\nhttp://www.twitter.com/armada\nhttp://armadamusic.com/googleplus", "title": "Dash Berlin feat.

The Commander-In-Chief recording rhythm and lead guitar with her prototype Ibanez Falchion 7, December 2011. She recorded the first 5 songs for her debut album, produced by the legendary Sterling Winfield (Pantera, Hatebreed, Hellyeah). This is from Winfield's statement about the recording:\n\n\"I am very proud to acknowledge the fact that what you are hearing is all 100% musician played performances! During the course of listening to these songs, you will NOT hear one drum hit that was moved around, placed on a grid, \"Sound Replaced\" or augmented in any way whatsoever. You will also NOT hear \"Auto-\u00ad\u2010 Tuner\", \"Melodyne\" or any other vocal tuning software of ANY kind!\n \nThat being said, I will answer the burning question looming in your minds... Yes, \"The Commander In Chief\" played ALL of the guitars you're hearing, and sang every single note. Not only did she do all of this, but she did it all with more great attitude, and professionalism than a lot of the veteran musicians I know that have been doing this almost longer than she has been alive. All of the musicians that played on this project were truly great! They all performed above and beyond the call of duty and I was proud to be a part of it.  \n \nI think that it is important to mention these things so that listeners and musicians\nalike can see that music can be made without all of the trappings or abuse of digital recording tools. This experience was also proof to me that there are musicians out there that still take pleasure in playing/singing and relying upon the discipline it takes to do so.\"", "title": "Commander-In-Chief and Sterling Winfield in studio", "publishedDate": "2012-01-23T20:24:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qZdan6WSC8", "description": "March 7 (Bloomberg) -- On today's \"This Versus That,\" Deirdre Bolton reports on the two biggest tech rivals Apple and Google.
