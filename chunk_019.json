Lecithin may be granular or liquid.\n\nBlend for 1 minute in a blender.\n\nPour both solutions into ultrasonic cleaner (about $35) for 6 minutes, stirring frequently with wooden spoon.\n\nRefrigerate.\n--------------\nThe Science:\n\nAn ultrasonic cleaner vibrates liquid with high frequency sound (25 kHz - 150 kHz). The high frequency vibrations encapsulates, or coats vitamin C particles in a layer of lipid material (liposomes) allowing for easy absorption through cell walls. The encapsulation also protects the ascorbic acid from being destroyed by stomach acid.\n---------\nAbsorption Facts:\n\n1,000 mg (1 gram) vitamin C tablet or capsule: Absorption 20% = 200 mg into blood stream\n\n1,000 mg Liposomal Vitamin C (1 tbsp Liposomal Encapsulated C): Absorption 80% + = 800 mg + into blood stream\n\nIn other words, 1 gram of liposomal encapsulated vitamin C (LEC) is equal to 4 grams + worth of regular vitamin C pills.\n---------\nVitamin C Facts:\n\nLEC is even more effective than ascorbic acid injections for absorption into cells.\n\nThere is no toxic dose of vitamin C.\n\nBoth FDA and Health Canada recommend 60 mg of vitamin C per day, which is about the content of 1 orange. Of that 60 MG, you will absorb 12 MG (20%) and the rest will be destroyed by stomach acid. With one tablespoon of LEC, you absorb about 422 MG.\n\nSince high doses of vitamin C can cause digestive problems, note that LE is an efficient and safe way to take high doses of vitamin C.\n\nYou can spend $30 to $60 for 2 ounces of ready made LEC if you want, or you can make it yourself for in minutes for pennies.\n\nMega-dosing on vitamin C has been known to cure everything from colds to cancer.

Each recognized breed of goats has specific weight ranges, which vary from over 300 lbs for bucks of larger breeds such as the Boer to 45 to 60 lbs for smaller goat does.[7] Within each breed, different strains or bloodlines may have different recognized sizes. At the bottom of the size range are miniature breeds such as the African Pigmy, who stand 16 to 23 inches at the shoulder as adults.[8]\n\n\nEye with horizontal pupil\nMost goats naturally have two horns, of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed. Goats have horns unless they are \"polled\" (meaning, 'genetically hornless') or the horns have been removed, typically soon after birth.[9] There have been incidents of polycerate goats (having as many as eight horns), although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited. The horns are most typically removed in commercial dairy goat herds, in order to reduce the injuries to humans and other goats. Unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled, as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked. Breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring. These intersex animals are typically sterile.[10]Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins, and are used for defense, dominance, and territoriality.[11]\nGoats are ruminants. They have a four-chambered stomach consisting of the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum, and the abomasum. As with other mammal ruminants, they are even-toed ungulates. The females have an udder consisting of two teats, in contrast to cattle, which have four teats.[12]\nGoats have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, an adaptation which increases peripheral depth perception.[13] Because goats' irises are usually pale, their contrasting pupils are much more noticeable than in animals such as cattle, deer, most horses and many sheep, whose similarly horizontal pupils blend into a dark iris and sclera.\n\n\nGoat tails versus sheep tails.\nBoth male and female goats have beards, and many types of goat (most commonly dairy goats, dairy-cross boers, and pygmy goats) may have wattles, one dangling from each side of the neck.[14]\nSome breeds of sheep and goats look similar, but they can usually be told apart because goat tails are short and usually point up, whereas sheep tails hang down and are usually longer and bigger -- though some (like those of Northern European short-tailed sheep) are short, and longer ones are often docked.", "title": "Goat ask for peanuts", "publishedDate": "2012-04-01T13:24:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "08EzqpiXWFI", "description": "Danse Country en Ligne de 32 temps sur 4 murs de niveau D\u00e9butant\nChor\u00e9graphe : Joyce Plaskett\nMusique : Land Of Dreams par Rosane Cash", "title": "An Absolute Dream", "publishedDate": "2013-05-02T10:57:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "08F6TeF9JVs", "description": "We are the first Bike Fitting and Performance Cycling studio in the Williamson County area and we provide training for athletes of all types, from weekend warriors trying to get in shape to elite athletes in Triathlon, Road and MTB.

The latest rankings of the best Home Theater Systems can be seen at:\n\nhttp://best-home-theater-system.bestofluxury.com/home-theater-reviews\n\nhttp://wwwbestofluxury.com\n\nAt bestofluxury.com, our evaluation of electronics is a rigorous process that identifies which home theater systems provide the best overall experience for enthusiasts and connoisseurs looking for a full media experience. With a large number of brands available, we understand the need for a measurement of quality. Our service helps enthusiasts and connoisseurs find the right home theater systems to meet their specific needs and requirements.\n\nOur methodology for evaluating home theater systems is a meticulous process in which our team performs market research and receives guidance from our network of enthusiasts to identify the key aspects that we use to evaluate home theater systems. Our enthusiasts are passionate about the field of electronics and are knowledgeable individuals who are interested in assisting us in identifying and evaluating the top home theater systems in the luxury industry.\n\nThe home theater systems featured in our rankings are evaluated based on video quality, design appeal, media support, audio quality, and features.\n\nVideo quality is evaluated based on how clear the picture is and how free it is of errors or distortion based on input into the visual display rather than in the visual display itself. Our evaluators engage in a variety of tests to understand how the video quality of the home theater system will impact the final picture.\n\nThe overall design appeal of the home theater system is another important aspect of our evaluation process. Our enthusiasts compare the aesthetics of the home theater system including the speakers and the components that provide the means of utilizing various types of media and controlling the sound components.\n\nMedia support is an important part of our evaluation. The latest home entertainment centers should do more than play DVDs or broadcast television. Our evaluators test each system and catalog the systems versatility. The outcome of these tests determine whether or not a particular system makes our final cut.\n\nAudio quality is every bit as important as video quality. Our evaluators test each system to determine the options available for sound quality. Some systems come standard with enhanced audio capabilities, such as surround sound, while other systems are expandable with add-on features. Our evaluators examine the advantages and disadvantages of each system so that demanding customers can find the system to perfectly suit their needs and preferences.\n\nFeatures, both traditional and those newer to the market, are closely examined by our certified evaluators. Many times customers acquire a system only to find out later that it does not have some of the features of the newest designs. We test all features for both ease of use and compatibility with existing systems.\n\nOur process is meticulous and thorough, allowing us to be critical of the most vital aspects of each home theater system. Our evaluation spans across different types of luxury electronics. We continue to monitor the market for changes in style, performance, expectations, and offerings from the manufacturers of home theater systems.", "title": "Home Theater Systems - Rankings Of Best", "publishedDate": "2013-06-21T02:43:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "08OqezyhzsY", "description": "An informative, humorous and nonpartisan, 3-minute song about California's six propositions on the November 2014 ballot, produced by the California Voter Foundation.

The competition is fierce, and with so much cash at stake, it's a dogfight to the \"bidder\" end!\n\nWatch free full episodes of STORAGE HUNTERS: http://bit.ly/1a9rj1S\nDownload full episodes of STORAGE HUNTERS on iTunes: http://bit.ly/13Dh3aL\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1cQL3bD @trutv\nLike us on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/16fheMx", "title": "Storage Hunters - The Mystery Box", "publishedDate": "2013-07-01T18:14:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "08XXBP42dKs", "description": "Todd Lee M.D. reviews the prohormone Methyl-1 Test.\nFor more information, read his article here:\n\nhttp://www.mindandmuscle.net/articles/methyl-1-test-2/\n\n\nYou're guide to everything muscle!\nKnowledge, Inspiration, Supplementation, Results.\nSpecializing in Prohormones and Workouts supplements.", "title": "Methyl-1 Test Review", "publishedDate": "2014-04-16T20:16:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "08XxQzNGUW0", "description": "Video que muestra a dos camellos africanos (llamados dromedarios, los de una sola joroba) rumiando la comida.

This is not always the case, however, since a root can also be aerial (growing above the ground) or aerating (growing up above the ground or especially above water). Furthermore, a stem normally occurring below ground is not exceptional either (see rhizome). So, it is better to define root as a part of a plant body that bears no leaves, and therefore also lacks nodes. There are also important internal structural differences between stems and roots.\nThe first root that comes from a plant is called the radicle. The three major functions of roots are 1) absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, 2) anchoring of the plant body to the ground and 3) storage of food and nutrients. In response to the concentration of nutrients, roots also synthesise cytokinin, which acts as a signal as to how fast the shoots can grow. Roots often function in storage of food and nutrients. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with certain fungi to form mycorrhizas, and a large range of other organisms including bacteria also closely associate with roots.", "title": "Root.\u6839.Ra\u00edz.2010.09.26.MP4", "publishedDate": "2010-09-26T14:16:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "08dJPLVZm0U", "description": "Gene Latter - Sign On The Dotted Line 1969 (and 1972)", "title": "Gene Latter - Sign on the dotted line", "publishedDate": "2012-12-31T19:43:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "08dWg_lV5Lw", "description": "***BURGUNDY BLOOD - THE THING from ICICLES of BLOOD EP.

Also read how to cure eczema naturally with proven home remedies. Learn how to cure eczema or dermatitis using natural remedies, lifestyle and diet. There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "Eczema Creams - How to Cure Eczema Without Using Eczema Creams", "publishedDate": "2014-01-28T10:17:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "08lQluQg30w", "description": "Teratoma y quiste folicular \nhttp://www.rafaelortegaginecologo.eu\nhttp://www.clinicaginecologicaciudadreal.com", "title": "Teratoma y quiste folicular  Dr. Rafael Ortega Mu\u00f1oz.avi", "publishedDate": "2010-04-06T22:18:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "08lWmu37bkY", "description": "", "title": "DJ Premier - Dink", "publishedDate": "2013-06-11T18:22:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "08luflFzld8", "description": "", "title": "\u0410\u043c\u0444\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u044a\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0430 (Amphitheater of Serdica)", "publishedDate": "2014-02-10T08:35:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "08m-ln5aXm4", "description": "Delicious preparation of Peruvian canario bean with a cilantro mixture. \nwww.peruvianpowerfoods.com visit our blog for more recipes.", "title": "Peruvian Beans a la Cilantro (Peruvian Power Foods) Vegan and Gluten Free", "publishedDate": "2014-01-25T15:03:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "08mKo0aOJys", "description": "Posing Striated Abs,Serratus,Vacuum July 4th 2014  Before Shaving and going to the Beach for more posing coming up Next:))", "title": "Striated Abs,Serratus,Vacuum", "publishedDate": "2014-07-04T22:55:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "08mY_JXFWs8", "description": "I read a rather beautiful poem by Tess Kincaid, who is close to the Scioto in Ohio.

Joseph, on coming to them, took them from their secret place, and, wrapping them in his linen frock, placed them under his arm and started for home.\"\n\n    After proceeding a short distance, he thought it would be more safe to leave the road and go through the woods. Traveling some distance after he left the road, he came to a large windfall, and as he was jumping over a log, a man sprang up from behind it, and gave him a heavy blow with a gun. Joseph turned around and knocked him down, then ran at the top of his speed. About half a mile further he was attacked again in the same manner as before; he knocked this man down in like manner as the former, and ran on again; and before he reached home he was assaulted the third time. In striking the last one he dislocated his thumb, which, however, he did not notice until he came within sight of the house, when he threw himself down in the corner of the fence in order to recover his breath. As soon as he was able, he arose and came to the house. lie was still altogether speechless from fright and the fatigue of running\" (History of Joseph Smith by His Mother, Lucy Smith, pp.107-108).\n\nhttp://www.mrm.org/topics/book-mormon/how-heavy-were-those-gold-plates\n\nSome Mormons object, \"The military run miles, with a heavier weight.\" But they forget that backpacks distribute the weight. Practice what you preach, guys, and make a YouTube video that demonstrates running miles with 50lbs of condensed weight tucked under your arm! So far every Mormon who has committed to this challenge has reneged once they try it themselves.\n\nRemember, this whole discussion is predicated upon apologists denying that the plates were really gold (in the normal sense) and instead arguing that it was a copper alloy with very little gold in it to begin with. Otherwise you have Smith running with plates that are over 200lbs. Before apologists have trimmed down the weight by assuming a copper alloy, but even they didn't get as ridiculously low as 40-60lbs, as some LDS apologists now maintain. John A. Widtsoe and Franklin S. Harris, Jr., wrote in Seven Claims of the Book of Mormon, p. 37:\n\nQuote:\n\"The plates upon which the Book of Mormon was engraved were made of gold and have been described as being about six inches wide by eight inches long by six inches thick. A cube of solid gold of that size, if the gold were pure, would weigh two hundred pounds, which would be a heavy weight for a man to carry, even though he were of the athletic type of Joseph Smith. This has been urged as an evidence against the truth of the Book of Mormon, since it is known that on several occasions the Prophet carried the plates in his arms. It is very unlikely, however, that the plates were made of pure gold. They would have been too soft and in danger of destruction by distortion.For the purpose of record keeping, plates made of gold mixed with a certain amount of copper would be better, for such plates would be firmer, more durable and generally more suitable for the work in hand. If the plates were made of eight karat gold, which is gold frequently used in present-day jewelry, and allowing a 10 percent space between the leaves, the total weight of the plates would not be above one hundred and seventeen pounds--a weight EASILY CARRIED by a man as strong as was Joseph Smith.\"\n\nThat is absurd. Really, try it yourselves. Or find a BYU football player who was Smith's age to try it.\n\nAnd even with such an alloy (tumbaga), given the 1) seer-stone translation method gathered from primary evidence (which was really dictation, not translation in the normal sense) 2) the verboseness of the English text (an absurdity given the conciseness of a conceivable language such as Reformed Egyptian) 3) the length of the text + 116 pages plus the larger portion that was sealed 4) the inability of an Egyptian based language to communicate lots of specific meaning in very few characters... is it extremely unlikely that the whole Book of Mormon + 116 pages could fit on the unsealed portion of the alleged Tumbaga plates in the dimensions provided, especially in a manner that would take the weight down to 40-60lbs.\n\nI'm still waiting for a replica that can be examined and weighed by the public. They made a replica at the LDS Museum in SLC but they haven't released the weight that it came out to.", "title": "So the Gold Plates are really copper?

A dica \u00e9 equipar sua sala com um Home Theater.\nA primeira coisa a saber \u00e9 que os aparelhos Home Theaters est\u00e3o dispon\u00edveis em modelos com leitores de DVD ou Blu-Ray. Se voc\u00ea j\u00e1 tem ou planeja comprar uma TV Full HD, prefira os com leitores de Blu-Ray. Essa tecnologia reproduz discos de alta defini\u00e7\u00e3o, al\u00e9m de contar com mais canais de \u00e1udio. Afinal, quando n\u00e3o estiver assistindo seu time de cora\u00e7\u00e3o poder\u00e1 curtir filmes com qualidade m\u00e1xima, sem perder nenhum detalhe.\nE por falar em canais de \u00e1udio, s\u00e3o diversos modelos como 2.1, 5.1, 7.1 canais e da\u00ed por diante. Esses n\u00fameros indicam a quantidade de caixas que comp\u00f5em o conjunto. O mais popular \u00e9 o sistema 5.1, ou seja, cinco caixas ac\u00fasticas e um subwoofer. Ent\u00e3o, vamos ver agora o posicionamento correto do Home em sua sala? \nA caixa central deve ficar acima ou abaixo da TV. As frontais, nas laterais, uma de cada lado, mantendo a mesma dist\u00e2ncia do centro. As caixas traseiras, atr\u00e1s do sof\u00e1. Em alguns modelos funcionam sem fio, sendo conectadas por meio de wi-fi ou bluetooth. J\u00e1 o subwoofer, deve ser colocado em um canto do ambiente, para garantir melhor performance dos sons graves. \nUma coisa \u00e9 certa! Quanto maior o local, mais potente dever\u00e1 ser o seu equipamento, desde que n\u00e3o comprometa a qualidade do \u00e1udio. De nada adianta tocar alto, mas distorcido, n\u00e3o \u00e9 verdade? Ent\u00e3o, ao comparar modelos, n\u00e3o leve em conta apenas a pot\u00eancia.  \nE \u00e9 por isso que vou mostrar pra voc\u00ea um pouco mais sobre os tipos de caixas ac\u00fasticas. \nOs modelos sat\u00e9lites s\u00e3o uma op\u00e7\u00e3o para ambientes pequenos com at\u00e9 quinze metros quadrados.\nAs caixas Bookshelf s\u00e3o indicadas para a maioria das salas que n\u00e3o ultrapassem os vinte e cinco metros quadrados.  \nJ\u00e1 as Tall Boy possuem formato superfino, al\u00e9m garantir um visual moderno e um melhor direcionamento do som. \nE por fim, as caixas torre: presentes em modelos mais potentes, s\u00e3o perfeitas para preencher lugares com mais de 25 metros quadrados.\nE uma boa alternativa para ambientes muito pequenos \u00e9 o SoundBar: uma aparelho compacto que deve ficar abaixo da TV e que simula o som das caixas ac\u00fasticas completas. \nGente, a tecnologia dos Home Theaters est\u00e1 t\u00e3o avan\u00e7ada que j\u00e1 existem modelos mais modernos com som 3D! Al\u00e9m de reproduzir imagens em tr\u00eas dimens\u00f5es, seu som \u00e9 trezentos e sessenta, ou seja: transmite a mesma impress\u00e3o de profundidade percebida nas imagens em 3D. \u00c9 genial!\nE com a tecnologia NFC voc\u00ea pode tocar as m\u00fasicas do seu smartphone ou outro dispositivo compat\u00edvel, sem precisar de fios diretamente no seu Home. Legal, n\u00e9?\nBom, espero que tenha gostado destas dicas.

Many people are as angry as the guy on the video confronting the woman. \nThe video, originally posted on YouTube, contains profanity.\nThe woman had been standing on the median to the entrance to Quail Springs Mall from Pennsylvania Avenue. She was holding a sign saying she was a 78-year-old widow and she needed money.\nDaniel Alyla is the one in the video yelling at the woman as she sits in her car.\n\u201cYou asking for money in the middle of the street and you drive a 2014 car,\u201d he said.\nAlyla said he works two jobs, but still tries to give to people who need help.\n\u201cI see you hungry, every day I give you three dollars, two dollars, Thursday I did not eat to give you four dollars,\u201d Alyla told the woman.\n\n\u201cIt made me mad when I saw her Monday behind this gas station parked counting the money, she had a lot of money in her lap and I couldn't take it,\u201d said Alyla on Friday.\n\nDespite the fact that the video has been shared 37,000 times on Facebook by Friday afternoon and viewed nearly 2,000,000 times, the lady was back at the same place on Friday. But she didn't want to talk about her car and even hit our photojournalist when he asked her about it.\n\nAccording to the Homeless Alliance only about 20% of panhandlers are actually homeless.\n\n\u201cBy far the majority of panhandlers we see are panhandling for cash, typically to support unhealthy behaviors, often alcoholism and other addictions.\u201d said Dan Straughan-Executive Director of the Homeless Alliance.\n\nThat's why they encourage people to give out vouchers they have had made up instead with information about shelters, a map and bus ticket to get there.\n\n\u201cIf you're really in need, this gives you access to where your needs can be met,\u201d said Straughan.\n\nIt's a lesson, Daniel said he has now learned.\n\n\u201cI'm not going to do it no more, never, never, never will give no money no more.\u201d\n\nYou can get a hold of the voucher books by contacting the homeless alliance. They cost $5 for a book of five to cover the cost of the bus ticket.\n\n\n man confront shout swear old woman elderly senior grandma beggar new Fiat car money caught on tape camera cellphone video footage Facebook viral panhandler panhandling  man confront shout swear old woman elderly senior grandma beggar new Fiat car money caught on tape camera cellphone video footage Facebook viral panhandler panhandling  man confront shout swear old woman elderly senior grandma beggar new Fiat car money caught on tape camera cellphone video footage Facebook viral panhandler panhandling  man confront shout swear old woman elderly senior grandma beggar new Fiat car money caught on tape camera cellphone video footage Facebook viral panhandler panhandling\n\nOKC Panhandler Busted & Confronted\nOklahoma City Panhandler is Busted When Caught in 2013 Car\nOklahoma City Panhandler is Busted When Caught in 2013 Car Oklahoma City Panhandler is Busted When Caught in 2013 Car ...\nOKC Panhandler Confronted After Being Seen Driving New Car\nOKC Panhandler Confronted After Being Seen Driving New Car OKC Panhandler Confronted After Being Seen Driving New Car ...\nViral video shows angry man confront panhandler in Oklahoma City\nOKLAHOMA CITY \u2013 A video of an angry man confronting a panhandler taken here in the metro has gone viral on Facebook.\nMan\u2019s heated confrontation with panhandler goes Viral\nMan's heated confrontation with panhandler goes viral.Some residents in Oklahoma City are angry after they claim to have been ...\n'Homeless' elderly panhandler caught driving off in a brand new car...\n'Homeless' elderly panhandler caught driving off in a brand new car...\nOklahoma City Panhandler is busted when caught in 2013 car\nYou drive a better car than me!

Het is een hele algemene vogel in Nederland maar hij heeft een uniek gedrag. Ze leven in grote groepen samen en ja- dat gedrag als ze in grote groepen vliegen dat is onvoorstelbaar. Ze voeren een waar ballet op en dat allemaal zonder verkeersleiding.\nJe ziet spreeuwen eigenlijk op verschillende plekken naar eten zoeken. In weilanden zie je soms enorme groepen - daar is ook veel te halen, het zijn insecteneters - maar in de winter kun je ook groepen spreeuwen op je voederplank krijgen. Een paar vetbollen vinden ze ook fantastisch. En vooral in de winter is de spreeuw heel erg mooi gekleurd - ioniserende kleuren - en dat is een lust voor het oog.\nAls je spreeuwen in zon grote groep ziet vliegen, dan vormen ze soms een enorme bol. En dan kan het weleens voorkomen dat een sperwer of een havik of een andere roofvogel aan de rand van de groep er een exemplaar uitpikt, maar dat is de natuur.\n\nSpreeuwen in de tuin is fantastisch, het zijn mooie vogels en in de winter kun je ze door ze te voeren in je tuin halen, maar ook in de zomer kun je spreeuwen in je tuin halen door een fantastische spreeuwenpot op te hangen, dat is niet alleen decoratief, maar ook geweldig voor de spreeuw als broedplaats.\n\u00a9 www.faunafilm.nl", "title": "Fauna Flyer: de spreeuw - sturnus vulgaris", "publishedDate": "2009-06-09T04:48:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "09aIb1TdBGs", "description": "", "title": "St. Peter's Cupule (Rome)", "publishedDate": "2012-03-21T18:30:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "09aSgLd2Muo", "description": "Hapa Kule News ni show moja ya njaro sana, aim yake ikiwa kuchambua uhondo deadly deadly zimehappen kwa news na kuziput across na design moja funny.

The writing would be inscribed on the base (flat side) of the scarab, and sizes varied from several centimeters to several meters long. It was not really until Pharaoh Amenhotep III's reign that the scarabs were made extra large (up to 2.5 metres long in the Karnak Temple!).\n\nScarabs were made from a wide variety of materials such as carnelian, lapis lazuli, basalt, limestone, schist, turquoise, ivory, resin, steatite, and bronze. Most scarabs were made of steatite which was then covered with a turquoise coloured glaze. The stone was soft and easy to work, but when glazed, it became hard and durable.\n\nIn the 12th dynasty, amethyst was used for the first time (a very hard material). Gold and silver scarabs have also been found, but are much rarer, because of grave robbers. The Greeks used onyx, agate, and quartz in making their scarabs. These materials were not used in Egypt until the Ptolemaic period, when Greek influence on Egyptian life was at a peak. The Greeks also had more advanced technology (in some areas) and could therefore work hard materials with greater ease than the Egyptians could.\n\nHeart scarabs were placed next to the heart after the body was mummified. The scarabs were usually made of green stone, and could range in size from 3 to 10 cm. On almost all of the scarabs, chapter 30B from the Book of the Dead was inscribed. In this chapter, the dead person asks his heart not to testify against him during the Weighing of The Heart Ceremony (whether he has commited a sin or not). In other cases, heart scarabs were used for just general protection from evil during the journey to the Afterlife.\n\nHeart scarabs were always made of some green material, usually green jasper. This stone is actually quite rare and difficult to cut, so in many cases other types of rock were used as substitutes, for example green feldspar, basalt, and serpentine. The reason why green was used was that it symbolised resurrection and health.\n\nThe Phoenicians lived in the area which we now call Lebanon and the Egyptians had a very strong bond with these people both politically and comercially. After some time the Egyptians started to influence the Phoenician culture, bringing the scarab into their art.\n\nThe first scarab from Phoenicia was made in the 8th century BC (approximately the 23rd dynasty). As the Phoenicians themselves were clever traders and posessed several colonies, they spread the scarab throughout the Mediterranean, bringing it to all major ports along their trade routes. The Greeks started using the scarab as well, and as a result, the scarab made it onto mainland Europe, into areas where the dung beetle had never lived.\n\nThe Greeks settled in Etruria in the mid-sixth century BC. They soon started to influence the Etruscans (the native civilisation of Etruria). The Greeks taught them how to make scarabs, but the Etruscans did not use the scarab as a seal. Instead they used them for ornamentation in everyday life.\n\nAs the scarab traveled throughout Europe and Asia by trade, war and politics, its purpose changed. Originally used as a symbol for birth and rebirth, it quickly evolved to becoming an amulet for protective purposes (used in many completely different religions), a seal for officials and later only for decorative purposes.", "title": "Sodomize the Insects - Scarabs Anthology", "publishedDate": "2009-05-25T18:58:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "09czVztVIOI", "description": "This video is part of the Google Analytics Platform Principles course on Analytics Academy.

S\u00e9ralini has received a letter from Elsevier's Food and Toxicology journal.\n\nA new editor at the journal, Richard Goodman, is a biologist who formerly worked for Monsanto - the leading producer of GM foods.\n\n\"If this magazine, which just hired a former Monsanto employee as an editor, withdraws this study, it'll mean it never existed. What we have tried to do, to try and carry out studies of the long-term effects of genetically-modified foods and pesticides on human health,  will be permanently shut off,\" said French MEP Corinne Lepage.\n\nAt the European level, GM crops are generally tested for no more than three months by the manufacturers who produce them. These studies are used to authorise the products. \n\nFor S\u00e9ralini  European institutions should also be responsible.\n\n\"We accuse the magazine of conniving with  Monsanto.

Why not earn cash and save lives at the same time?\n\n\nStep 1: Have great swim skills\nConsider your calling. If you're a strong swimmer, this may be the perfect gig for you. But if your best stroke is the dog paddle, it\u2019s time to rethink.\n\nStep 2: Be a people person\nBe a people person. Lifeguarding is a pretty hands-on job, and requires a lot of interaction with the public. It helps if you're good with people and great with kids.\n\nStep 3: Investigate jobs\nSee what\u2019s available in your area. Contact your local facilities department to inquire about jobs at public pools, and your local parks department for jobs at beaches. Each facility has its own water-safety requirements, so be sure to investigate what credentials you'll need.\n\nTip\nConsult \"aquaticscareers.com\":http://aquaticscareers.com, \"lifeguardingjobs.com\":http://lifeguardingjobs.com, \"craigslist.com\":http://craigslist.com, and online job sites for listings. \n\nStep 4: Get certified\nGet the proper certification. Each certification course has its own special age requirements, training procedures, and course fees. And it's generally harder to patrol the beach than police the pool.\n\nTip\nLifeguard certification courses are offered through the American Red Cross, the YMCA, the United States Lifesaving Association, and Jeff Ellis and Associates. \n\nStep 5: Apply\nChoose the positions you want to apply for based on pay, location, convenience, size of facility, and how many guards they\u2019re looking for. Then thoroughly complete and submit your applications in a timely manner.\n\nStep 6: Ace the interview\nAce the job interview by being friendly, energetic, and professional. You want to appear responsible and competent.\n\nStep 7: Stay in shape\nOnce you land your dream job, you'll need to stay in shape. Hit the gym, do your laps, and stick with a healthy diet.\n\nStep 8: Protect your skin\nAvoid skin damage by using a good sunscreen and shielding yourself from dangerous doses of UV rays by covering up with a hat, protective clothing, and a towel, and staying in the shade.\n\nStep 9: Keep up with your credentials\nCertifications expire after set periods of time, so make sure you keep up with renewal dates and exams. You may also want to further your career by pursuing higher certifications.\n\nDid You Know?\nThe oldest lifeguard on record is 88-year-old Heywood Stewart.", "title": "How to Become a Lifeguard", "publishedDate": "2009-07-14T19:22:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "09qiVV_bRbc", "description": "Ruby Grace.  2001 single from the album 'Short-Staffed At the Gene Pool'.

You'll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumbs, Or engaged in doing complicated long-division sums. Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a Cat of such deceitfulness and suavity. He always has an alibi, and one or two to spaer: At whatever time the deed took place - MACAVITY WASN'T THERE!

(yet we always get lectured by Chicken Little types)\n  I used two high speed cameras to capture it at two different angles and speeds  (300 and 600 fps)  To the best of my knowledge this has never been done before.\n-\nDon't try this at home. \n-\nFAQ:  \"Where do you get this mercury?\"\nI worked at a plastics mfg and we used many mercury contactors in the process.   Mercury contactors are heavy duty relays and were used to cycle resistance heaters in the extruders.  Most of the contactors were 3 pole and rated for 480 volts.   These contactors would fail and since there was mercury inside each one I'd have to decommission them and removed the mercury inside them.   In several instances,   the contactors would explode and sort of go  \"super nova\"  and actually burn up most of the wiring inside electrical panels,  and the mercury would have to be cleaned up from the panels,   and then I would have to completely re-wire the panels.    \n\nMusic by Mad Mav\nRise of the Mad - 4th Mov (Allegretto)", "title": "Massive  MERCURY-FILLED Water Balloon - Popped  (slow motion Hg)", "publishedDate": "2012-01-22T18:47:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AKvtAsN0mk", "description": "33TV Italo Skarcha ft Giz Da Bosstype (ROYALIST) - Never Change (Music Video)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GizROYALIST\nhttps://twitter.com/ItaloSkarcha\n\nFor More Info On 33TV Music Videos, Please Email:\ninfo@33TV.co.uk\nWebsite: http://www.33TV.co.uk", "title": "33TV Italo Skarcha ft Giz Da Bosstype (ROYALIST) - Never Change (Music Video)", "publishedDate": "2012-08-11T20:31:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ALB-F5mCJc", "description": "How To Measure A Sofa Cushion", "title": "How To Measure A Sofa Cushion", "publishedDate": "2008-11-25T02:54:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ALM7X1_LqA", "description": "Myxococcus xanthus predation ripples.

Es la respuesta. Carlos Vela finalmente volver\u00e1 a la Selecci\u00f3n Nacional. Gente cercana al delantero de la Real Sociedad revel\u00f3 a ESPN.com.mx que el atacante s\u00ed atender\u00e1 el llamado de Miguel Herrera con el representativo mexicano. El futbolista est\u00e1 convencido que es momento de regresar al Tri.\n\nHan pasado 1321 d\u00edas que Carlos no daba su brazo a torcer, por lo que finalmente tuvo la decisi\u00f3n de que puede ayudar y volver a vestir con orgullo la playera mexicana. De aquel 18 de marzo del 2011 cuando Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la Torre cit\u00f3 a Carlos Vela para disputar los amistosos que sostendr\u00eda M\u00e9xico ante Paraguay y Venezuela pasaron muchos d\u00edas para que su nombre apareciera en un llamado a la Selecci\u00f3n Mexicana. Ahora su mentalidad cambi\u00f3 y dijo \"s\u00ed\".\n\nEl estratega Miguel Herrera convoc\u00f3 al elemento de la Real Sociedad junto a otros nueve futbolistas aztecas que militan en Europa para los amistosos que sostendr\u00e1 en noviembre frente a Bielorrusia y Holanda, duelos que se celebrar\u00e1n en el Viejo Continente.\nLa negativa en procesos anteriores y la solicitud de no ser llamado para el Mundial de Brasil 2014 son parte de los episodios que se vivieron durante tres a\u00f1os, una historia que alej\u00f3 al nacido en Canc\u00fan del Tricolor. Cabe recordar que en la eliminatoria mundialista para la Copa Mundial el equipo mexicano no la pas\u00f3 nada bien y se mencion\u00f3 en los medios que lo indicado era llamar Vela, delantero que se encontraba en gran momento con su club en Espa\u00f1a. La charla se dio con el entrenador Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la Torre y el futbolista dijo que no se encontraba en condiciones de representar al equipo nacional.\n\nPosteriormente arrib\u00f3 a la direcci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica del Tri, V\u00edctor Manuel Vucetich, y tampoco fue considerado el elemento del conjunto vasco. Cerca de la cita mundialista y antes de anunciar la lista oficial de los 23 jugadores que participar\u00edan en Brasil, Miguel Herrera acudi\u00f3 a Europa para platicar con los futbolistas que ser\u00edan considerados, al no ver inter\u00e9s de Carlitos por defender los colores de M\u00e9xico en el Mundial, el estratega lo dej\u00f3 fuera de la convocatoria.\n\nHasta hace un mes el atacante de la Real Sociedad asegur\u00f3 que no era el momento, sin embargo, su deseo es volver a entablar pl\u00e1ticas con Miguel Herrera y saber cu\u00e1les son las condiciones de su regreso nuevamente al combinado nacional.", "title": "Carlos Vela dice \"S\u00ed\" a La Seleccion Mexicana; Regresa Despues de 3 A\u00f1os", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T00:30:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AM3miP0X4Q", "description": "2001 live @ Splash", "title": "Creutzfeld & Jakob - Zugzwang", "publishedDate": "2009-07-26T09:12:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AMM8HqSatc", "description": "Trapped bank robber tries to blast through door glass only to be captured", "title": "Armed bank robber trapped by Access Control Vestibule", "publishedDate": "2008-01-15T20:53:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AMTIO3SLwI", "description": "In a CNN exclusive, Susan Candiotti interviews Adam Lanza's schoolmate and his sister about the Newtown school massacre.", "title": "Lanza's schoolmate stunned by massacre", "publishedDate": "2012-12-18T16:53:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AMWx45NJCw", "description": "Thumbs up the video if you want more videos like this!\nFacebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001277172501\nSkype: jefflang88  Twitter: senorblanco88   Aim: senorblanco88 DN: senorblanco88\n2nd Youtube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/senorblancoMTG\nWants List: https://sites.google.com/site/langswantlist/", "title": "TCG ACCESSORY REVIEW: ULTRA PRO SATIN TOWER DECK BOX", "publishedDate": "2013-03-04T22:20:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AMxi0LYOpM", "description": "\"The Japanese spider crab, Macrocheira kaempferi, is a species of marine crab that lives in the waters around Japan.

The ducks are divided between several subfamilies in the Anatidae family; they do not represent a monophyletic group but a form taxon, since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.\n\nDucks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules, and coots.\n\nThe word duck comes from Old English *d\u016bce \"diver\", a derivative of the verb *d\u016bcan \"to duck, bend down low as if to get under something, or dive\", because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending; compare with Dutch duiken and German tauchen \"to dive\".\n\nThis word replaced Old English ened/\u00e6nid \"duck\", possibly to avoid confusion with other Old English words, like ende \"end\" with similar forms. Other Germanic languages still have similar words for \"duck\", for example, Dutch eend \"duck\" and German Ente \"duck\". The word ened/\u00e6nid was inherited from Proto-Indo-European; compare: Latin anas \"duck\", Lithuanian \u00e1ntis \"duck\", Ancient Greek n\u0113ssa/n\u0113tta (\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1, \u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1) \"duck\", and Sanskrit \u0101t\u00ed \"water bird\", among others.\n\nSome people use \"duck\" specifically for adult females and \"drake\" for adult males, for the species described here others use \"hen\" and \"drake\", respectively.\n\nA duckling is a young duck in downy plumage or baby duck but in the food trade young adult ducks ready for roasting are sometimes labelled \"duckling\"\n\nThe overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad, and the ducks are also relatively long-necked, albeit not as long-necked as the geese and swans. The body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in being more rounded. The bill is usually broad and contains serrated lamellae which are particularly well defined in the filter-feeding species. In the case of some fishing species the bill is long and strongly serrated. The scaled legs are strong and well developed, and generally set far back on the body, more so in the highly aquatic species. The wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed, and the flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes, requiring in turn strong wing muscles. Three species of steamer duck are almost flightless, however. Many species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting; they seek out protected habitat with good food supplies during this period. This moult typically precedes migration.\n\nThe drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage, but that is moulted in summer to give a more female-like appearance, the \"eclipse\" plumage. Southern resident species typically show less sexual dimorphism, although there are exceptions like the Paradise Shelduck of New Zealand which is both strikingly sexually dimorphic and where the female's plumage is brighter than that of the male. The plumage of juvenile birds generally resembles that of the female.\n\nDucks exploit a variety of food sources such as grasses, aquatic plants, fish, insects, small amphibians, worms, and small molluscs.\n\nDiving ducks and sea ducks forage deep underwater. To be able to submerge more easily, the diving ducks are heavier than dabbling ducks, and therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly.\n\nDabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land, or as deep as they can reach by up-ending without completely submerging. Along the edge of the beak there is a comb-like structure called a pecten. This strains the water squirting from the side of the beak and traps any food. The pecten is also used to preen feathers.\n\nA few specialized species such as the mergansers are adapted to catch and swallow large fish.\n\nThe others have the characteristic wide flat beak designed for dredging-type jobs such as pulling up waterweed, pulling worms and small molluscs out of mud, searching for insect larvae, and bulk jobs such as dredging out, holding, turning headfirst, and swallowing a squirming frog. To avoid injury when digging into sediment it has no cere. but the nostrils come out through hard horn.", "title": "American Coot Duck", "publishedDate": "2011-07-28T01:48:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AQY-eCA2Ps", "description": "First Born (LN) - Hell A Raise - Dead Voices Riddim \u00a9 2014 \nProduced by SoundBanks Rec \n\nPin: 73FEBAE2 | Akam Entertainment Social Media:  \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/akam_ent\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/akam_ent\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/akam.ent\n\nHype Life Magazine - Exploring the most dynamic range of music, videos, celebrity news, fashion, beauty, lifestyle and artworks concerning Jamaica to California.\nVisit: http://hypelifemagazine.com\n\nFirst Born (LN) - Hell A Raise [Dead Voices Riddim] November 2014 \nFirst Born (LN) - Hell A Raise [Dead Voices Riddim] November 2014 \nFirst Born (LN) - Hell A Raise [Dead Voices Riddim] November 2014 \nFirst Born (LN) - Hell A Raise [Dead Voices Riddim] November 2014", "title": "First Born (LN) - Hell A Raise [Dead Voices Riddim] November 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-11-11T23:02:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AQdSw4G7TY", "description": "So I was playing ffa and I got a great lead and then I went for the 3 piece since it was so perfect, and then this, theater messed up the three piece so it doesnt look so clean but 1080, and with a shit shot I went for cause this kid camped up top (and pretty annoyed) cya rip", "title": "Three Piece Hitmark (With a shit shot)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-20T20:07:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AR5pd5A2NY", "description": "Newlyweds Bride Brie & very reserved Groom Evan's a'Mazin surprise first wedding dance.

Atopic eczema, atopic dermatitis, infantile eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, and varicose eczema are but a few of the many types of this skin disorder. The most common type is atopic dermatitis, which is often seen in infants and small children. (Nine out of ten of eczema cases happen in children younger than five years old.) Rarer forms include dyshidrotic eczema, which occurs in warm weather, and nummular eczema, which occurs mostly during winter.\nhttp://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nDuring an eczema flare-up, the person experiences itching and rashes that may be red or brownish, scaly, dry, thick, leathery, crusty or flaky. These may also appear as blisters oozing fluid, or as small, elevated bumps on the skin. In some cases, the skin simply becomes thick, rough and red. When scratched, eczema rashes may be infected, and this can worsen the inflammation. The rashes are often found on the arms, legs, chest, hands, or the face. In children, the rashes typically appear on the cheeks, elbows or knees, especially in skin folds.\n\nEczema is believed to be caused by a hereditary impairment of the immune system. A person with eczema often has family members who also have eczema, asthma or hay fever. The standard treatment is anti-itch topical medications, including anti-histamines. This treatment only relieves the symptoms, and does not cure eczema. There is, in fact, no known cure for eczema. It is a lifelong skin problem that recurs every now and then.\n\nWhile eczema has no cure, there are many management strategies to keep it under control, relieve the itchiness and discomfort, and prolong the time between recurrences. Besides medicinal anti-itch lotions, there too are eczema home remedies and skin care measures that can be used to manage eczema effectively.\n\nEczema home remedies include herbs and natural ingredients that can be made into lotions, pastes or ointments, and then applied on the rashes or affected skin areas.

This video segment was taken from the \u201cSubclinical Chicken Anemia Virus infection: Preventing immunosuppression induced by CAV in your flocks,\u201d webinar sponsored by Lohmann Animal Health and presented by WATT Global Media. The webinar educates on the impact of subclinical Chicken Anemia Virus (CAV) infection and the role of CAV maternally derived antibodies. Subclinical infection with CAV is an important co-factor enhancing the pathogenicity of a large number of other pathogens. Audience learning points include: What is subclinical Chicken Anemia Virus infection; which are the interactions between CAV-induced thymus depletion and secondary infections; and how to reduce the immunosuppression induced by Chicken Anemia Virus. \n\nTo view the entire webinar, please visit: https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/774533128", "title": "Consequences of CAV subclinical disease in poultry flocks", "publishedDate": "2014-09-08T16:04:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AecjZeysSg", "description": "", "title": "Pansa Chelera", "publishedDate": "2013-01-10T02:05:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AfCCr4_isQ", "description": "This particular male is feeding with a sense of urgency.

Churchland:\n\n\"So, what about free will?\n\nAlmost certainly, brains are causal machines. By which I mean, that they go from state to state as a result of antecedent conditions. Any particular state, whether it's a perception of a face or whether it's a reflex to withdraw from pain, is a result from antecedent conditions. At least, that seems to be true from everything we know so far in neurobiology, everything we know at the level of the single neuron and what causes it to behave the way it does, the way neurons interact with each other to produce a complex macro effect, and the way that many levels of neurons interact with each other to produce a behaviour. It's a causal machine.\n\nThere does not appear to be, so far as we can tell at this stage, any noncausal Cartesian substance that intervenes and has an effect on the brain to produce a change or a decision. It looks like there is only the physical brain.\n\nBut of course, having said that it's only a physical brain, don't sell it short. It's a remarkable, unique, unbelievably complex, and we're only just learning how complex organ.\"\n\n\u2014 snippet gleaned from a May of 2006 UCtv talk\n\"Decisions, Responsibility, and the Brain\"\nby Patricia S.

Cette op\u00e9ration, qui \u00e0 la base n'\u00e9tait qu'une id\u00e9e int\u00e9ressante nous paraissait relativement simple. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait des tests,  on trouve toujours que c'est int\u00e9ressant mais... loin d'\u00eatre si simple qu'on le pensait ! On pensait qu'une limitation s\u00e9v\u00e8re de l'intensit\u00e9 de rechargement des piles faisait l'affaire,  et bien non : les piles alcalines ne sont m\u00eame pas chaudes (pas la moindre) mais elles fuient : l'\u00e9lectrolyte fuie par l'issue de la borne n\u00e9gative... Peut \u00eatre que cette fuite n'est pas tr\u00e8s grave ? disons que, lorsque la pile fuit elle perd son \u00e9lectrolyte donc dans le meilleur des cas elle perd 50% de sa capacit\u00e9 ! de plus une fuite se termine toujours par une petite explosion (d'un seul coup, l'\u00e9lectrolyte qui pousse s'\u00e9chappe brutalement de la pile...) inutile de vous pr\u00e9ciser qu'\u00e0 ce stade la pile Alcaline est foutue. Donc on a essay\u00e9 de trouver un autre moyen : la technique d'un contact discontinu : Grace \u00e0 cette technique la pile pourrait subir des contraintes bien moindre lors du rechargement pensions nous : oui mais \u00e0 la condition de laisser \u00e0 la pile deux fois plus de temps pour se reposer que pour recharger. Et \u00e7a marche ! en r\u00e9unissent une limitation de l'intensit\u00e9 et un contact discontinu 2 secondes sur 6 les piles Alcalines rechargent sans probl\u00e8me ! c'est vrai que quand on voit toutes les conditions qu'il faut pour les recharger on a encore peur qu'elles fuient m\u00eame comme cela. d'apr\u00e8s tous les tests que nous avons fait il s'av\u00e8re que cette technique et tr\u00e8s sure ! que ce soit en rechargeant des piles AA, AAA ou 9 volts, aucun probl\u00e8me \u00e7a marche et \u00e7a ne fuit pas. Dans le pire des cas on peut toujours limiter encore plus l'intensit\u00e9. \nOn vous conseille, en vous aidant d'une r\u00e9sistance variable jouant sur l'intensit\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e pass\u00e9e par un transistor de faire recharger les piles AA (classiques) alcalines \u00e0 250mA maximum (250mA 2 secondes sur 6) soit en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 une moyenne de 80mA. Si on consid\u00e8re qu'on r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e8re \u00e0 80% la pile, et qu'elle fait 2Ah il faudrait 20 heures pour en recharger une compl\u00e8tement (ce qui est \u00e9lev\u00e9 mais finalement pas tellement si nous ne sommes pas press\u00e9es...) Pour recharger les piles il faut leur injecter une tension sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celles  des piles r\u00e9unies pas moins de 1.5 fois celle des piles dans l'id\u00e9al : si 4 piles (1.5 volts) font 6 volts alors il vous faudra 9 volts au moins pour les recharger. la tension \u00e0 besoin d'\u00eatre au moins 1.5 fois plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e car parfois, m\u00eame r\u00e9sistance variable r\u00e9gl\u00e9e au minimum on a pas 250mA...\npour recharger des piles AAA on vous conseille 110mA max (2 f/6), on vous conseille 70mA max (2f/6) pour recharger une pile de 9 volts.  Ce chargeur peut charger autant de piles que l'on veut ! avec 12 volts on peut aller jusqu'\u00e0 6 (plus avec plus de 12 volts mais dans ce cas l\u00e0 pensez \u00e0 augmenter la valeur de certaines r\u00e9sistances). Avant de charger les piles essayer de les s\u00e9lectionner : ne jamais en prendre qui ne sont pas Alcalines,qui fuient d\u00e9j\u00e0, qui sont rouill\u00e9s, qui sont d'une marque \"po cher\" et douteuse, qui donnent \"0.00 volts\" ou qui sont cens\u00e9s \u00eatre \"p\u00e9rim\u00e9es\" depuis trop longtemps. n'oubliez pas que les piles alcaline se recyclent et que les piles rechargeables sont tellement mieux ! L'avantage de charger des piles alcalines est par exemple plus utile pour les piles AAA et 9 volts : certains appareil tr\u00e8s basse conso (d\u00e9tecteur de fum\u00e9e, r\u00e9veil digital etc...) on besoin de piles, lorsque celles ci sont vides, on n'a pas envie d'acheter une pile rechargeable pour la recharger 2 fois au cours de sa vie ! c'est pour \u00e7a que les piles alcalines, bon march\u00e9 (et rechargeables...) sont parfaite pour cette utilisation =)\n\n-Autres titres : Recharger des piles non rechargeables / recharger piles alcalines / salines / s\u00e8ches / chargeur pour piles alcalines / homemade alkaline battery charger / charge alkaline batteries / Id\u00e9e incroyable exp\u00e9rience TPE TIPE BAC S / vik95170 / exp\u00e9rience science Fran\u00e7ais / DIY", "title": "Chargeur piles alcalines : Incroyables Exp\u00e9riences [66] Chargeur de piles non rechargeables / DIY", "publishedDate": "2010-08-31T16:54:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Asei8u9mTk", "description": "A brief tutorial showing some of the high points from which to DP.\n\n- DeC-2: first invisible wall & the two billboards\n- HR-2: saferoom silo & invisible wall at end saferoom", "title": "Tab's L4D2 - Tutorial - Hunter Damage Pounce Spots", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T15:08:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AslM2bC5DY", "description": "The Prince & Me Movie Clip - watch all clips http://j.mp/KW2J5V\nclick to subscribe http://j.mp/sNDUs5\n\nEddie (Luke Mably) and Paige (Julia Stiles) share their first kiss.\n\nTM & \u00a9 Paramount (2012)\nCast: Luke Mably, Julia Stiles\nDirector: Martha Coolidge\nMOVIECLIPS YouTube Channel: http://j.mp/vqieFG\nJoin our Facebook page: http://j.mp/tb8OMH\nFollow us on Twitter: http://j.mp/rZzGsm\nBuy Movie: http://j.mp/LZj9u2\nProducer: Mark Amin, Jeffrey Lampert, David Minkowski, Robin Schorr, Cami Winikoff\nScreenwriter: Jack Amiel, Mark Amin, Michael Begler, Katherine Fugate\nFilm Description: For the second time in her career, Julia Stiles plays a character romancing the Crown Prince of Denmark in The Prince & Me, a romantic wish-fulfillment fantasy from director Martha Coolidge. Far from her role as Ophelia in 2000's Hamlet, however, Stiles plays Paige, a plucky, determined college student from the Midwest who's buried in her last few semesters of pre-med studies when she meets Eddie, a brash, impudent Danish foreign-exchange student who just happens to have a mysterious partner (Ben Miller) shadowing him in everything he does. What Paige doesn't know is that Eddie is in fact the spoiled son of the King (James Fox) and Queen (Miranda Richardson) of Denmark, on holiday in America hoping to find a nonstop keg party complete with buxom American babes. What he and his butler don't count on is squalid dorm life, final exams, and the possibility that Eddie might actually find his true soul mate in the sensible Paige. But when Eddie finally reveals his secret, will Paige want to give up her dreams of becoming a doctor for a playboy prince?\n\n\"the prince & me\",\"the prince & me clip\",\"the prince & me part 1\",\"the prince & me 3\",\"the prince & me full movie\",\"julia stiles\",\"luke mably\",\"martha coolidge\",\"romantic comedies\",\"romantic dramas\",romance,\"teen romance\",\"david minkowski\",\"mark amin\",\"jeffrey lampert\",\"cami winikoff\",\"robin schorr\",\"happiness videos\",\"lust videos\",\"romance videos\",\"sex sensuality videos\",\"barn videos\",eddie,\"paige morgan\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++290202,/m/0dh9b4,/m/02jtjz", "title": "The Prince & Me (4/8) Movie CLIP - A First Kiss (2004) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-18T19:37:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AswuNS1nLE", "description": "Essential Of Cell Biology\nVideos\nEndoplasmic Reticulum Tubules", "title": "Endoplasmic Reticulum Tubules (ECB)", "publishedDate": "2010-10-18T20:23:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "0AtFB4iZ0SY", "description": "Servizio realizzato da TG Norba dedicato alla manifetazione \"Ville in Festa\", gioielli di architettura che potrebbero diventare relais per un soggiorno indimenticabile.\nOspitalit\u00e0 a 5 stelle sul meraviglioso mare che bagna S.

KavaBoy is a thriving family business based in Kailua, Hawaii. We have been in business since 1999. Our kava is grown on our kava farms in Vava'u, Tonga. We grow kava from the white variety called Hinehina. The kava is then brought to Hawaii where we process and package the kava.\n\nThis kava contains no additives. Our kava is cultivated pesticide-free, and then it is harvested only after 5+ years. Only the root of the kava plant is used. Our fine kava powder makes for a smooth and light taste that is packed with powerful kavalactone.\n\nKava, also known as Piper methysticum, is the most effective relaxing and stress-relieving plant in the world. Kava, which grows throughout the Pacific, including Tonga & Hawaii, has been used for thousands of years in ancient Polynesia. Traditionally, the kava root was chewed up and spit out for ceremonial or medicinal purposes. Today, kava is enjoyed throughout the islands of Polynesia as a strained, fresh drink. The effective compound of the kava root, also known as kavalactone, is what produces the benefits of kava.\n\nOur ancestors used only the root of the plant to make their kava. At KavaBoy, we stick to our roots! We use only the root of the kava plant which we pulverize into a powder. The kava drink is enjoyed by massaging and straining the kava root in cool water. The produced beverage promotes tranquility of body and mind. Our kava is grown for five years or more. This is to ensure highest potency.\n\nFor more information, read the Honolulu Advertiser's articles entitled UH scientists may have solved kava mystery and Hawaii kava study finds liver anomaly. Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database is another helpful website with a lot of information on kava. Kava is not a drug nor is it alcoholic. Top\n\nOur kava root is grounded up into a dry powder. You will need a fine strainer such as our chiffon strainer bag. You may also use nylon stocking, cheese cloth, a muslin tea bag, or silk screen to strain the kava. We have also heard of people using under armor shirts or socks! Personally, we believe silk screen strainers do the best job of straining the kava powder. You can get any of these materials at your local drug store or craft store. \n\nBefore you begin, make sure to wash your hands. Insert the desired amount of kava powder into your strainer. If you are using a piece of any of the suggested materials, make sure the piece of material is big enough to hold your desired amount. We suggest using 1-2 tablespoons of kava per one cup of cold water. Spoon the desired amount into/onto the middle of the material. Pull up the corners, and tie with a rubber band or hold tightly closed. This is just to make sure you get the least amount of powder/fiber into your drink.\n\nPlace your kava-filled strainer into your desired amount of cold water. Massage the strainer/tea bag in the cold water. The action of massaging the kava helps activate and release the kavalactone from the powder, so this is very important. \n\nContinue massaging until the water turns a cloudy/opaque brown. You may also notice that the kava begins to have an oily appearance. This is from the non-soluble kavalactones. There is no exact time frame for massaging. We normally massage small amounts of kava for a few minutes. The greater the amount of kava powder and water used, the longer you would want to massage it and wring it out. Make sure the end product is a milkier/opaque color (as pictured below) as opposed to a watery color. Your kava is ready to be consumed! \n\nhttp://www.habilitat.com\n\n1-800-872-2525", "title": "All about Kava from Kava Boy at Pacific Island Kava Festival", "publishedDate": "2012-10-30T00:22:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "0BC7yITEKmA", "description": "\u2605 Enjoyed it?

Systemic enzymes are those that operate, not just for digestion, but throughout your body in every system and organ. But let's take first things first, what is an enzyme?\nAn enzyme is a biocatalyst - something that makes something else work or work faster. Chemical reactions are generally slow things, enzymes speed them up. Without enzymes, the chemical reactions that make up our life would be too slow for life as we know it. (As slow as sap running down a tree in winter). For life to manifest, as we know it, enzymes are essential to speed up the reactions. We have roughly 3000 enzymes in our bodies and over 7000 enzymic reactions. Most of these enzymes are derived or created from what we think of as the protein digesting enzymes. But while digestion is an important part of what enzymes do, it's almost the absolute last function. \n\"Enzymes don't only help the sick, they help everyone. If you're over the age of 27, your body is no longer producing the amount of enzymes that it needs to run smoothly and because of that fact, it's around this time that things start falling apart. We're here to try to help you put it back together.\" \nThe following are reported benefits from systemic enzymes, including blends with large quantities of protein eating (proteolytic) enzymes.\n\nhttp://www.takebackyourhealth.com/articles.html\nhttp://www.takebackyourhealth.com/testimonials.html", "title": "28 Reasons To Use Systemic Enzymes After The Age Of 27 Years Old  Part 1", "publishedDate": "2008-12-21T00:32:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "0BF6z-Szr7o", "description": "www.loudlabs.com\n\nBELLFLOWER - Things got a bit smokier than usual at a Bellflower\n barbecue restaurant today, as two vans and a smokehouse behind the eatery\n caught fire.\n    The blaze at Hambone's Southern BBQ at 9334 Alondra Blvd. was reported\n at 12:13 p.m. and was put out 16 minutes later, said Cheryl Sims, supervising\n dispatcher with the Los Angeles County Fire Department.\n    No one was injured and the cause was under investigation, she said.\n     Alondra Boulevard was closed in both directions as firefighters put out\n the fire.", "title": "BBQ Smokehouse & Vehicle Fire / Bellflower   RAW FOOTAGE", "publishedDate": "2014-10-06T02:50:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "0BF9MkmTBjk", "description": "Serving Sara Movie Clip - watch all clips http://j.mp/AuDdUv\nclick to subscribe http://j.mp/sNDUs5\n\nKate (Amy Adams) talks to Joe Tyler (Matthew Perry) with her body.\n\nTM & \u00a9 Paramount (2012)\nCast: Matthew Perry, Amy Adams, Libby Villari\nDirector: Reginald Hudlin\nMOVIECLIPS YouTube Channel: http://j.mp/vqieFG\nJoin our Facebook page: http://j.mp/tb8OMH\nFollow us on Twitter: http://j.mp/rZzGsm\nBuy Movie: http://j.mp/wdGPOv\nProducer: Dan Halsted, Dan Kolsrud, Roland Pellegrino, David Scheer\nScreenwriter: David Ronn, Jay Scherick\nFilm Description: A process server makes an unusual alliance with a beautiful but devious woman in this comedy. Joe Tyler (Matthew Perry) is a former attorney whose career went bust when he picked up some clients who turned out to be associated with the Mafia. These days, Joe makes his living as a process server, who presents people with legal papers -- papers they would usually prefer not to get. One of Joe's fellow servers, Tony (Vincent Pastore), is trying to weasel him out of his job, and has starting tipping off Joe's targets before he can deliver their papers in order to get Joe in dutch with their boss, Ray (Cedric the Entertainer). Joe, however, is able to persuade Ray to give him another chance with a high-profile client, Gordon (Bruce Campbell), a wealthy Texas cattle baron who has decided to divorce his wife and business partner, Sara (Elizabeth Hurley), in order to marry another woman, Kate (Amy Adams). When Joe presents Sara with the divorce papers, she is shocked by the news, which would cost her her half of the Gordon fortune. After Joe gets carjacked and finds herself on the same bus with Sara, she makes him a deal: If he's willing to take back the papers, say he never presented them, and serve a divorce petition to Gordon first, she'll pay Joe an even million dollars. Serving Sara became the focus of some unexpected controversy during its production -- first when Matthew Perry took a brief leave from the production to enter a rehabilitation clinic to fight an addiction to painkillers, and later when Elizabeth Hurley's former boyfriend, Steve Bing, accused Perry of being the father of Hurley's child (a charge both Hurley and Perry denied, and was proven false by blood tests).\n\n\"serving sara\",\"serving sara clip\",\"serving sara trailer\",\"serving sara part 1\",\"amy adams\",\"matthew perry\",\"libby villari\",\"reginald hudlin\",\"beer videos\",\"cigarette videos\",\"mechanical bull videos\",\"romantic comedies\",comedy,romance,\"slapstick comedies\",\"dan halsted\",\"dan kolsrud\",\"roland pellegrino\",\"david scheer\",\"betrayal videos\",\"discovery videos\",\"ethics videos\",\"greed videos\",\"bar videos\",kate,\"joe tyler\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++263574,/m/01hxs4,/m/0b25vg,/m/0gc4hbd", "title": "Serving Sara (9/10) Movie CLIP - Talking Breasts (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-03-15T15:09:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "0BFh0cE-CdY", "description": "Cheerleader Desiree Jennings develops neurological condition 10 days after a flu shot.

The reason water goes into the can is because when the steam contracts and takes up less room, the vacuum pulls material (in this case water) from whatever holes back into the can.

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS. \n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Best of Nebraska's Ameer Abdullah vs. Miami (FL)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-21T06:36:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "0BMY9rsaGz0", "description": "", "title": "ING LLANOS \u00d1IQUIN SE RESPONSABILISA DE OBRA TIPUANA TIPA 2", "publishedDate": "2009-11-15T15:07:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "0BMagWZIO2A", "description": "", "title": "MVR Discovery", "publishedDate": "2012-01-29T00:23:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "0BMbsW_Tt2A", "description": "Music video by Mark Medlock & Dieter Bohlen performing Unbelievable.

Finally, we have to highlight the different possible operating configurations (crane, hydraulic grab, cable grab, hydraulic rotary, dragline, etc.), which allow the SC-65 to be suitable for a large range of building yards.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Soilmecspa\nSubscribe on our YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=SoilmecSpa\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/SoilmecSpapa", "title": "Soilmec Crawler Crane SC 65 [electro-hydraulic proportional control system]", "publishedDate": "2012-07-02T07:23:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "0BUuJXEEPqE", "description": "Flora Fauna Cemento \"Mondo blu\"\n\n(di Mogol - Lucio Battisti)\n\nNon so\nchi sei\nper\u00f2\nti avr\u00f2\ne tu\nmi avrai\nla notte\nsai\nnon mente mai\nse amore c'\u00e8\nlo scoprirai\ncon me\nL'amor\nl'amor\ncos'\u00e8\ndimmi, dimmi cos'\u00e8\nIo e te\nnoi?\nIo e te\ne poi\ne poi\nqualcosa in pi\u00f9\ncos'altro?\nUn mondo blu\nche c'\u00e8\nah, allora c'\u00e8\nNon c'\u00e8\nma come?\nper\u00f2\ncon te\nio dico che c'\u00e8\nAllora c'\u00e8 il nostro mondo blu\nOra vieni qui\ntra le braccia\ndimmi se\nvedi anche tu\nun mondo blu\nGuarda in su\nno non ti spaventare\nNon pu\u00f2 tardare\nvedo che\nridi anche tu\nadesso per noi\nil mondo \u00e8 blu\ns\u00ec blu\nUn mondo blu che c'\u00e8\nah, allora c'\u00e8\nNon c'\u00e8\nma come?\nper\u00f2\ncon te\nio dico che c'\u00e8\nAllora c'\u00e8 il nostro mondo blu\nOra vieni qui\ntra le braccia\ndimmi se\nvedi anche tu\nun mondo blu\nGuarda in su\nno non ti spaventare\nNon pu\u00f2 tardare\nvedo che\nridi anche tu\nadesso per noi\nil mondo \u00e8 blu\nS\u00ec,S\u00ec,S\u00ec,S\u00ec,blu,blu,blu,blu,S\u00ec,S\u00ec,blu,blu,S\u00ec,blu\nUn mondo blu che c'\u00e8\nah, allora c'\u00e8\nNon c'\u00e8\nma come?\nper\u00f2\ncon te\nio dico che c'\u00e8\nAllora c'\u00e8 il nostro mondo blu", "title": "FLORA FAUNA & CEMENTO \"Mondo Blu\" 1972(c'\u00e8 il testo) (Primo passaggio nel web!)", "publishedDate": "2011-07-05T05:20:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "0BVCw9r07aw", "description": "Currently Up For Auction on www.WireBids.com", "title": "Ryobi 500NX Offset Press w Crestline Dampening and T 51 2nd Color Unit", "publishedDate": "2014-07-09T16:33:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "0BVFzVsQSdk", "description": "Mehrere Exemplare der Taubnessel \"White Nancy\" mit hellen Bl\u00fcten im Botanischen Garten Augsburg am 15.

It is the second-most populous nation in Africa, with over 82 million inhabitants,[3] and the tenth-largest by area, occupying 1,100,000 km2. Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south. With its capital at Addis Ababa, it is also the most populous landlocked nation in the world.\nEthiopia was a monarchy for most of its history, and the Ethiopian dynasty traces its roots to the 2nd century BC.[5] Ethiopia is also one of the oldest sites of human existence known to scientists today, having yielded some of humanity's oldest traces.[6] It may be the region from which Homo sapiens first set out for the Middle East and points beyond.[7][8][9] Alongside Rome, China and Persia, the Ethiopian Aksum Empire was considered one of the four great world powers of the 3rd century.[10][11][12] During the Scramble for Africa, Ethiopia was the only African country beside Liberia that retained its sovereignty as a recognized independent country, and was one of only four African members of the League of Nations. After a brief period of Italian occupation, Ethiopia became a charter member of the United Nations. When other African nations received their independence following World War II, many of them adopted the colors of Ethiopia's flag, and Addis Ababa became the location of several international organizations focused on Africa.", "title": "Statistics \"Pareto Chart \" Ethiopian language (Amharic) # 1", "publishedDate": "2012-02-12T13:56:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Bf442y4bvg", "description": "The saddest thing about it is that Americans think they have fabulous fashion, think they have intriguing conversations (Americans betray the freedom of speech, essentially), think they have the best food in the world (assuming that exporting fast food speaks volumes about the quality of American food).

Ne consegue che la creazione di immagini che fanno riferimento al suo umorismo, alle sue doti creative, etc. \u00e8 un elemento protetto dalla legge e che appartiene al suo creatore, quindi al Parodista. \nLegge citata, estratto dall'articolo 3: \"Le opere collettive, costituite dalla riunione di opere o di parti di opere, che hanno carattere di creazione autonoma, come risultato della scelta e del coordinamento ad un determinato fine [...] artistico, [...] sono protette come opere originali, indipendentemente e senza pregiudizio dei diritti di autore sulle opere o sulle parti di opere di cui sono composte.\" \nQuesta legge \u00e8 piuttosto importante nell'ambito della parodia. Si indica che un'opera creata unendo altre opere o parti di esse \u00e8 da considerarsi autonoma qualora fosse il risultato di una scelta artistica. Opera da considerarsi, inoltre, protetta come opera originale e senza pregiudizio su altri diritti d'autore gi\u00e0 esistenti. \nLegge citata estratto dall'articolo 4: \"Senza pregiudizio dei diritti esistenti sull'opera originaria, sono altres\u00ec protette le elaborazioni di carattere creativo dell'opera stessa, quali [...] le trasformazioni da una in altra forma [...] artistica, le modificazioni ed aggiunte che costituiscono un rifacimento sostanziale dell'opera originaria, gli adattamenti, le riduzioni, i compendi, le variazioni non costituenti opera originale.\" \nIn questa legge si sottolinea che le modifiche e le aggiunte eseguite ad un'opera gi\u00e0 esistente (nel caso della parodia una nuova elaborazione di nuovi testi, nuove scene amatoriali, scritte, effetti speciali, proprie immagini, ecc.), sono protette e senza pregiudizio di diritti d'autore gi\u00e0 esistenti. \nDirettiva 2001/29/CE del Parlamento europeo e del Consiglio, del 22 maggio 2001(GU n. L 167 del 22/06/2001), estratto dall'articolo 5: \"Sono esentati dal diritto [...] gli atti di riproduzione [...] privi di rilievo economico proprio che sono [...] parte integrante e essenziale di un procedimento tecnologico [...]\", in particolare al paragrafo 3 lettera K \"quando l'utilizzo avvenga a scopo di caricatura, parodia o pastiche.\" \nQuesta direttiva \u00e8 specifica per la parodia. In questo senso, la legge specifica che \u00e8 possibile distribuire un'opera parodiata senza scopo di lucro e senza dover sottostare a diritti d'autore gi\u00e0 esistenti. \nTrib. Milano 29 gennaio 1996, in Foro it.,1996, I, 1426 e in Dir. Industriale, 1996, 479, n. MINA; Trib. Milano 15 novembre 1995 in Giur. It., 1996, I, 2, 749, in particolare alla dichiarazione: \"A questo proposito, cercando di analizzare giuridicamente questo caso, va premesso che la parodia, secondo la giurisprudenza, si risolve sempre in un'opera autonoma e distinta rispetto a quella di riferimento e non richiede il consenso da parte del titolare del diritto di utilizzazione economica. L'opera pertanto sar\u00e0 imputabile solo al parodista e giammai, neanche in parte, all'autore dell'opera parodiata.\" \nArticolo 21 della Costituzione Italiana, \"Tutti hanno diritto di manifestare liberamente il proprio pensiero con la parola, lo scritto e ogni altro mezzo di diffusione\".

You just ride with Sylvanas while she tells a story to you. Awesome!\n\nI have not always been the Banshee Queen. And my people have not always been the Forsaken. Long ago this land comprised the northern kingdoms of Lordaeron, ruled by King Terenas Menethil. Terenas had a son named Arthas. Arthas... even saying his name makes my body quiver in rage. This man-child, Arthas, took for himself a cursed blade known as Frostmourne. Through Frostmourne, Arthas killed his own father and razed this land along with every living creature in it! My own death came at the hands of Arthas when he and his armies sacked my homeland, Quel'Thalas, and murdered my people. In his vast cruelty, Arthas severed my spirit from my body and raised me as a banshee to serve in his Scourge army. A similar fate befell all that would die to the Scourge war machine. In death, they were reborn as mindless undead. But Arthas was not invincible! With each passing day his power waned - his grip over the will of the damned loosening. It was when Arthas was at his weakest that I struck! And thought the hour of his atonement had come, the worm managed to escape his fate, returning to the frozen wastes of Northrend. With Arthas gone, so too was the control he held over the undead masses of Lordaeron. After recovering my body, I freed the remaining Scourge that were left behind. From the cruelty and mercilessness of Arthas, the man who would be the Lich King, the Forsaken were born. Our goal... Our sole purpose was to destroy the Lich King. We threw our lot in with the Horde and began our journey towards redemption. Now the Lich King is dead and we have returned. The people who called this land their home in life, do so in death as well. But the Alliance does not recognize our rights. They claim this land is their own while attempting to invalidate the claims of the founders of this kingdom. I will never allow it... Never!

So funktioniert unter Umst\u00e4nden der Internetzugang nicht mehr. SuperAntispyware repariert Registry-Eintr\u00e4ge und Verkn\u00fcpf\u00fcngen, um den Fehler zu beseitigen.\n\nDas Tool sucht nicht auf Basis von Signaturen nach Spy- und Adware, das sogenannte Multi-Dimensional Scanning soll auch noch nicht bekannte Malware dank heuristischer Suchverfahren finden. Bei jedem Start werden rund 50 als \u201eAngriffspunkte\" bekannte Systemstellen auf Befall untersucht, was eine eventuelle Infektion schneller eind\u00e4mmen soll.\n\nINFO: Das vorgestellte Programm scannt nach Schadsoftware und bietet die Funktion an, diese zu entfernen. Es dient nicht als Antivirenprogramm, da wir den kostenpflichtigen W\u00e4chter nicht nutzen, denn daf\u00fcr haben wir ja schon ein AV-Programm. Mehrere W\u00e4chter w\u00fcrden sich blockieren. Also nutzen wir dieses TOP Tool zum Scannen und Entfernen von Malware und beenden es dann wieder.\n\n\u25ba Malwarebytes Anti-Malware: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=117bAJ6DQfo&list=UUaPTqdoDK3_zoO4vy2Ph9oA&index=2&feature=plcp\n\n\u25ba WOT-Bewertung der Downloadseite: http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/filepony.de?utm_source=addon&utm_content=rw-viewsc\n\n\u25ba Die gezeigte & empfehlenswerte Seite: http://www.trojaner-board.de/\n\n\u25ba Mein Kanal und weitere Videos: http://www.youtube.com/user/softwarerulez", "title": "SuperAntiSpyware - Vorhandene Spyware finden & entfernen", "publishedDate": "2012-11-15T18:01:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "0C1Nu-8HWqc", "description": "Ukraine War - UAV at Work: Exploration and correction of artillery fire.
