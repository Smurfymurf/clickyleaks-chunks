Artocarpus integra) berasal dari India bagian selatan. Nangka termasuk keluarga Moraceae yang masih satu marga dengan sukun, keluwih, cempedak, bendo.\n\nNangka mirip dengan cempedak, tetapi bila diperhatikan dengan seksama terdapat perbedaan antara keduanya, yaitu buah nangka panjangnya 30-90 cm, garis tengahnya 25-50 cm; buah yang matang berwarna kuning, kuning kecokelatan atau hijau, aromanya harum; dagingnya tebal, agak keras, warnanya kuning keemasan, kuning kemerahan atau kuning keputih-putihan.\n\nNangka yang disukai konsumen adalah yang daging buahnya besar, tebal, berbiji kecil, manis, harum, dan lunak. Secara umum ada dua golongan nangka yaitu nangka biasa dan nangka bubur. Nangka biasa dagingnya keras dan agak kesat, sedangkan nangka bubur dagingnya lunak dan berair.\n\nNangka umumnya mulai berbuah setelah berumur 8 tahun dan beratnya mencapai 20 kg, bahkan ada yang sampai 40 kg. Tanda buah yang telah matang adalah makin jarangnya letak antarduri kulit dan kalau dipukul berbunyi dug . . dug dari dalam.\n\nDikenal pula nangka mini, nangka ini cepat berbuah, pada umur 18 bulan sudah mengeluarkan buah yang pertama. Ukurannya hanya 5-15 kg, tetapi berbuah lebat.\n\nDalam satu pohon terdapat 30 sampai 50 buah, pada usia 10-15 tahun nangka mini sudah tidak dapat diharapkan lagi produksinya.\n\nJenis nangka yang dikenal masyarakat bermacam- macam. Hal ini disesuaikan dengan kebiasaan orang menyebutnya. Ada nangka kapuk yang daging buahnya empuk, buahnya besar, dan panjang serta warnanya hijau segar sewaktu muda. Duri kulit buah besar dan jarang. Dibandingkan dengan jenis nangka lain, nangka kapuk daunnya lebih besar, panjang, dan tebal.\n\nDi Jawa Tengah dikenal pula berbagai macam nangka dan jenis nangka tersebut juga berdasarkan sebutan yang belum berlaku umum di masyarakat. Ada kemungkinan jenis buahnya sama tetapi sebutannya berbeda, seperti nangka salak dagingnya \"kencang\" seperti salak. Nangka pandan harumnya seperti daun pandan. Nangka sukun bijinya kecil sekali. Nangka kunir, dagingnya kuning seperti kunyit (kunir).

It eats fish and nests in holes in trees. John James Audubon called this bird the \"Buff-breasted Merganser\" in his book The Birds of America.\n\nIt is 58--72 cm (23--28 in) long with a 78--97 cm (31--38 in) wingspan, and a weight of 0.9--2.1 kg (2.0--4.6 lb); males average slightly larger than females but with some overlap. Like other species in the genus Mergus, it has a crest of longer head feathers, but these usually lie smoothly rounded behind the head, not normally forming an erect crest. Adult males in breeding plumage are easily distinguished, the body white with a variable salmon-pink tinge, the head black with an iridescent green gloss, the rump and tail grey, and the wings largely white on the inner half, black on the outer half. Females, and males in \"eclipse\" (non-breeding plumage, July to October) are largely grey, with a reddish-brown head, white chin, and white secondary feathers on the wing. Juveniles (both sexes) are similar to adult females but also show a short black-edged white stripe between the eye and bill. The bill and legs are red to brownish-red, brightest on adult males, dullest on juveniles\n\nSource- Wikipedia .\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Even though the actual risk to consumers is often not specified,   these types of warnings tend to perpetuate ingredient-based food fears that cause consumers to steer clear of foods that contain ingredient x without actually knowing the facts. While many fears are based on actual health risk and are therefore merited, others are based on misinformation and can cause damage to food manufacturers, farmers and potentially even the consumers they are meant to protect.  Cornell Food and Brand Lab researchers found that there are common characteristics among individuals more inclined to have food fears and that there are some effective ways to reduce unmerited ingredient bias among consumers. Lead author Brian Wansink states, \"Inaccurate and negative evaluations of an ingredient can be offset through increased familiarity with the ingredient including its history, background and general use.\"  \n\nThe study, published in Food Quality and Preference, was conducted via a phone survey of 1008 U.S. mothers who were asked questions about the controversial food ingredient High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS).  The researchers wanted to uncover who was most likely to avoid fear-evoking ingredients, background reasons for avoiding it, and what could be done to minimize and correct misconceptions. \n\nThe study found that when participants were told that a food perceived as relatively healthy contained HFCS, they rated it as less healthy than if it contained regular sugar.  However, foods perceived as less healthy, such as heavily processed foods, were rated the same whether or not they listed HFCS as an ingredient. The study also found that those who claimed to avoid HFCS (versus those who did not) were not willing to pay more for foods that contained regular table sugar. HFCS avoiders were also more likely to receive their information from the internet rather than TV and expressed a desire to have their food related opinions known. \n\nResearchers found that giving more information about the ingredient such as its history is effective in reducing ingredient fears. To arrive at this conclusion they asked participants to rate the healthfulness of Stevia, a natural sweetener. Half of the participants were given historical and contextual information to read about the product and the remaining participants were not given anything to read. Those who received information about an ingredient's history rated the product higher than those who did not. Researchers also experimented with referring to HFCS as \"corn sugar\" and found that the new name increased ratings slightly but was still rated lower than table sugar in perceived healthfulness. \n\nIn conclusion, Dr. Wansink recommends as an effective way to reduce unwarranted aversion to an ingredient to \"familiarize the public with it by sharing its history and functions and letting them know what common products currently contain it\u2014once people feel familiar with the ingredient, they'll find no reason to fear it!\"\n\nFor more information visit: http://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/op/food-fear", "title": "Food Fears: Increasing Familiarity is the Best Way to Avoid Ingredient-Based Food Fear", "publishedDate": "2014-06-25T20:55:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "26ETHm1tsdQ", "description": "Composed by Eiko Ishiwata\nAnimation by Fridtjof L.

And I may not upload another any time soon. Lately everything has been going shit for me, had big plans for the Obey RC but they failed miserably, singular things looked cool on their own but it came together horribly, but I learned a fuckton in cinema 4d from it. In short, I'm taking a break from editing, dunno how long that's gonna last but I'm going to be focusing more on design and school and just life in general now.\n\nBut as always, thank you all for the amazing support, but from now on most of the things on this channel is gonna be speedarts.

Nel 2011, dopo un'incessante attivit\u00e0 live, Salmo produce il primo disco solista \"The Island Chainshaw Massacre\" dove mischia sonorit\u00e0 elettroniche e rap anni 90, tratto distintivo e rivoluzionario per il panorama rap italiano.\n\nLo stesso anno SALMO si trasferisce a Milano con la sua Machete Crew e, a inizi 2012, in una sola settimana d\u00e0 vita - per Tanta Roba, l'etichetta indipendente di Gu\u00e8 Pequeno e Dj Harsh - all'album della svolta: \"Death USB\". Il disco va subito al primo posto in classifica su iTunes nella settimana di Sanremo. SALMO diventa cos\u00ec l'artista pi\u00f9 cliccato, davanti ai big della musica italiana e internazionale. Si aggiudica anche un MTV Music Awards nella categoria Best Crossover. Persino Jovanotti si accorge della portata rivoluzionaria dell'arte di SALMO e ne esprime il suo apprezzamento su Twitter: \"Questo Death USB di SALMO mi piace, c'\u00e8 vita nella musica italiana\".\n\nL'attivit\u00e0 live occupa un posto centrale nella vita di SALMO che trova sul palco la sua naturale e autentica dimensione, a contatto col suo pubblico, trasversale come il suo personaggio e la sua proposta musicale, pesantemente contaminata e in continua evoluzione. \n\nIl 2 aprile 2013 \u00e8 uscito, sempre per Tanta Roba Label, il nuovo disco \"Midnite\" (slang per \"Mezzanotte\", l'ora zero della nostra epoca infernale), una bomba di 13 tracce anticipato dal singolo \"Russell Crowe\" (Produzione di Cyberpunkers). \n\"Midnite\" ha raggiunto, dopo una settimana dall'uscita, il primo posto tra gli album pi\u00f9 venduti in Italia ed \u00e8 stato premiato a luglio 2013 con il Disco d'Oro per aver venduto pi\u00f9 di 30mila copie (dato GFK).", "title": "SALMO - NEGATIVE YOUTH", "publishedDate": "2012-02-22T21:54:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "26QUH99HiLw", "description": "Music of Suriname: The Surinam Golden Gate Boys - kokodiako", "title": "The Surinam Golden Gate Boys - kokodiako", "publishedDate": "2011-07-28T17:54:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "26Qcydj00TM", "description": "Dr. Yazeed Maghaydah is a UConn-trained geriatrician with expertise in memory disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

This process is also used in many other private and business organizations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations.\n\n\nElectronic ballots are used in Brazilian elections.\nThe universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens. As the Elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.[not verified in body]\nElectoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems. Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).\nTo elect means \"to choose or make a decision\"[2] and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States.\nSource-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election", "title": "A View on the day of Election.", "publishedDate": "2013-12-04T11:03:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "26TjdGCWjAQ", "description": "", "title": "A\u00e7ougue - cara fez doutorado em carnes - conhece todas (picanha, costela, lingui\u00e7a) kkkk", "publishedDate": "2014-06-10T18:43:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "26U-nMPh_DQ", "description": "", "title": "White-throated Kingfisher - Bird Sound", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T07:10:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "26U1mEj7yC4", "description": "CAT May 2012.

She is also well known for her role as Mary Hatch in Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946). She worked extensively in television, notably as Donna Stone, an American middle class mother in the sitcom The Donna Reed Show (1958--1966), in which she played a more prominent role than many other television mothers of the era and for which she received the 1963 Golden Globe Award for Best TV Star - Female.\n\nLater in Reed's career she replaced Barbara Bel Geddes as Miss Ellie Ewing in the 1984 season of the television melodrama, Dallas, and sued the production company for breach of contract when she was abruptly fired upon Bel Geddes' decision to return to the show...\n\nEarly life\n\nReed was born Donna Belle Mullenger on a farm near Denison, Iowa, the daughter of Hazel Jane (n\u00e9e Shives; 1899--1975) and William Richard Mullenger (1893--1981). The eldest of five children, she was raised as a Methodist. After graduating from Denison High School, Reed planned to become a teacher, but was unable to pay for college. She decided to move to California to attend Los Angeles City College on the advice of her aunt. While attending college, she performed in various stage productions but had no plans to become an actress. After receiving several offers to screen test for studios, Reed eventually signed with MGM, but insisted on finishing her education first.\n\nAfter signing with MGM in 1941, Reed made her film debut that same year in The Get-Away, opposite Robert Sterling. Billed in her first feature as Donna Adams, MGM decided against the name and changed it to Donna Reed. She starred in The Courtship of Andy Hardy and had a supporting role with Edward Arnold in Eyes in the Night (1942). In 1943, she appeared in The Human Comedy with Mickey Rooney, and They Were Expendable in 1945.\n\nHer \"girl-next-door\" good looks and warm on-stage personality made her a popular pin-up for many GIs during World War II. She personally answered letters from many GIs serving overseas.\n\nIn 1945, she struggled with an English accent and with a passive, underwritten role as Gladys Hallward in the first cinema adaptation of the Oscar Wilde novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray.\n\nIn 1946, she was lent to RKO Pictures for the role of Mary Bailey in Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life. The film has since been named as one of the 100 best American films ever made by the American Film Institute and is regularly aired on television during the Christmas season.\n\nFollowing the release of It's a Wonderful Life, Reed appeared in Green Dolphin Street (1947) with Lana Turner and Van Heflin, and Scandal Sheet (1952). In 1953, she played the role of Alma \"Lorene\" Burke, and girlfriend of Montgomery Clift's character in the World War II drama From Here to Eternity. The role earned Reed an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for 1953.\n\nThe Donna Reed Show\n\nFrom 1958 to 1966, Reed starred in The Donna Reed Show...\n\nDonna Reed died of pancreatic cancer in Beverly Hills, California, on January 14, 1986, 13 days shy of her 65th birthday...\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_bond#Nonmarketable_securities\n\nU.S. Savings Bonds\n\nSavings bonds were created to finance World War I, and were originally called Liberty Bonds.

Their own endonyms were Safinim for the country (attested in one inscription and one coin legend) and Safineis for the people.[3]\nEtymologically, the name Samnium is generally recognized to be a form of the name of the Sabines, who were Umbrians.[4] From Safinim, Sabinus, Sabellus and Samnis, an Indo-European root can be extracted, *sabh-, which becomes Sab- in Latino-Faliscan and Saf- in Osco-Umbrian: Sabini and *Safineis. The eponymous god of the Sabines, Sabus, seems to support this view. The Greek terms, Saunitai and Saunitis, remain outside the group. Nothing is known of their origin.\nAt some point in prehistory, a population speaking a common language extended over both Samnium and Umbria. Salmon conjectures that it was common Italic and puts forward a date of 600 BC, after which the common language began to dialectize. This date does not necessarily correspond to any historical or archaeological evidence; developing a synthetic view of the ethnology of proto-historic Italy is an incomplete and ongoing task.\nLinguist Julius Pokorny carries the etymology somewhat further back. Conjecturing that the -a- was altered from an -o- during some prehistoric residence in Illyria, he derives the names from an o-grade extension *swo-bho- of an extended e-grade *swe-bho- of the possessive adjective, *s(e)we-, of the reflexive pronoun, *se-, \"oneself\" (the source of English self). The result is a set of Indo-European tribal names (if not the endonym of the Indo-Europeans): Germanic Suebi and Semnones, Suiones; Celtic Senones; Slavic Serbs and Sorbs; Italic Sabelli, Sabini, etc., as well as a large number of kinship terms. The general concept is \"our own kith and kin,\" Pokorny's \"von eigener Art,\" \"Gesamtheit der eigenen Leute,\" \"Liebe,\" \"Sippegenossen,\" \"Sippenangeh\u00f6rigen,\" and the like.[5]", "title": "Srs Samnite", "publishedDate": "2014-03-19T15:02:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "26Xhj9Za9sI", "description": "Teachers, bosses, family will challenge you.

Look for green bead-like droppings around a plant. Instead of removing them or killing them, keep them in jars covered with net or just cover a bush with net. They make wonderful pets. Try it!\n\nHawk moth, name for the members of a family, Sphingidae, of large moths found in many parts of the world. They are also known as sphinx moths. They have stout bodies, relatively small, narrow wings and long tongues or proboscis. They fly chiefly at dusk.\n\n Because the hawk moths have relatively heavy bodies (packed with powerful muscles) and small, narrow triangular wings, they are not able to glide and can fly only with fast powerful beats. The wings moving so quickly that they can be seen only as a blur. The hawk moths can hover, with furiously beating wings, in front of a flower, extend their long tongue and suck up nectar without alighting.  Some of them can even fly backward.\n\n The caterpillars of hawk moths or sphinx are usually impressive and large, which in most species have a sharp horn at the rear end. Like most moths, their pupae are brown and smooth.A great many moth caterpillars merely dig down into the ground and there pupate with no cocoon.\n\nFor the \u201cPandakaki\u201d hawk moth,which I have called as such because the caterpillars lived on the leaves of the medicinal \u201cPandakaki\u201d plant, it took fourteen days in the pupal stage before the imago or the adult moth emerged.\n\nSources:   Grolier\u2019s \u201cThe Book of Knowledge\u201d 1962, Volume 18,   \n                    pp. 6523-6540.\n\n         Encyclopedia International 1969 Volume 12, p.302 and \n                      Volume 8, p. 349.\n\nThese moths, Daphnis Nerii, are known as the Oleander Hawk Moth or Army Green Moth found in Mangaon, Maharashtra, India However, there the caterpillars feed mainly on oleander (Nerium oleander) leaves, a highly toxic plant to which toxicity they are immune. They also may feed on most plants of the Dogbane family, such as Adenium obesum, and Tabernaemontana divaricata and Alstonia scholaris in India.\n\n         The newborn caterpillars are pale blue.

The first movement, \"One Thousand Refracting Dew- Drops,\" deals with rhythm in a fairly systematic way (and owes a lot to Ligeti), while attempting to give the impression of a glittering firmament of tiny water droplets. The second, \"Gathering Clouds,\" approaches the materials of the first movement in a more intuitive way as the texture builds up from a single note to large clusters. There is also a brief quotation from Debussy's Nuages. Finally, the third movement, \"Inside the Thunderclap\" is an attempt to look at the space be- tween the first and second parts of the thunder sound (the \"ka\" and \"boom\"...). It begins with a large cluster and then incorporates small motives that grow denser until a final cluster. Each of these motives represents tiny zaps of electricity. The rhythm is again approached in a systematic way, but very differently from the first movement.\n\u2014 Matthew Heap", "title": "Matthew Heap's, On the Ceiling of the Sky: I.

There were once again far to many highlights to mention here so you will need to read the trip report once it is complete. We recorded an amazing 696 species with many more specialities and endemics than other companies get. In Santa Marta accompanied by our excellent guide - Juan, we saw just about everything we had hoped for. Notable sightings included a Kelp Gull we found at Los Flamencos (this may represent the 1st for Colombia), also 4 Scaled Piculets, Tocuyo Sparrows, all the Santa Marta endemics, with amazing close views of just about everything. A Fuscous Flycatcher near Tayrona may represent a very good record and along the coast we cleaned up with all the specialties in little over an hour! Some sort of record no doubt. On our mainland tour we again found an endless amount of endemic and sought after species. Some birds of note included Sharp-tailed Streamcreeper, 2 Dusky Starfrontlets near Jardin (this is the 3rd year we have found this mega!), Tanager Finches, Chestnut-crested Cotinga, Colombian Screech-Owl, Shining-green and Violet-bellied were surprises amongst the 66 species of hummingbird seen. This included 2 or 3 Black-thighed Pufflegs, Bearded Helmetcrest, Indigo-capped and many more. Other memorable sightings included Olive Finch, Magdelana Antbird, Beautiful Woodpecker, Multicoloured Tanager, Turquoise Dacnis, Choco Vireo, Munchique Wood-Wren, Ocellated Tapaculo, Bogota Rail, lots of antpittas coming to worms and fabulous looks at the newly described Antioquia Wren.

They have peculiar, somewhat putrid 'earthy' smell (hard to describe but it's somewhat like earth and decaying leaves). \n\nThese are silicon equivalent of saturated hydrocarbons, alkanes, like methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), etc. However, they are much less stable than the alkanes and undergo explosive combustion in contact with air to form silicon dioxide or silica (SiO2) and water vapor, but some silicon may also be formed.", "title": "Silanes", "publishedDate": "2008-10-03T23:45:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "27AtGkQZE3c", "description": "", "title": "DAY 2 CHEERER 5.mp4", "publishedDate": "2011-04-15T21:54:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "27AvxPt_OXY", "description": "Subscribe for new videos every Monday and Thursday:  http://goo.gl/K1e8Q\n\nPaul Jibson harvests a monster bull scoring 406\" with a rifle in Utah.\n\nhttp://www.mossback.com", "title": "406\" Monster Bull Elk - Paul Jibson - MossBack", "publishedDate": "2014-05-16T15:25:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "27B0ZI4l1i8", "description": "", "title": "WAKA KISHAR live act FRANCE -rennes 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-01-21T09:39:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "27B0bzHRNoA", "description": "Shop Online | http://www.workwearzone.co.uk\n\nCarhartt Work Wear from WorkWearZone.co.uk - the UK's premier stockists of premium quality workwear clothing, accessories and PPE equipment.\n\nFollow the link below to see our full range of Carhartt Workwear Jackets at WorkWearZone.co.uk:\nhttp://bit.ly/carhartt-workwear-trousers", "title": "Carhartt Workwear Clothing - WorkWearZone.co.uk", "publishedDate": "2012-09-28T13:47:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "27B7hN3IhDw", "description": "\uc7a0\uc790\uace0 \uc77c\uc5b4\ub098\uc11c \ud55c\uac74\ub370 \uc601\uc0c1\ud55c\ubc88 \ub300\ubcfc\uae4c \ud574\uc11c \ub313\uac74\ub9cc 1\uc794\uae30 \ub0a8\uae30\uace0 \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4.", "title": "DODONPACHI MAXIMUM 5-E STAGE HIBACHI CLEAR", "publishedDate": "2013-01-05T03:31:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "27BC6hbGKS4", "description": "Comment se forment les rayures du dentifrice?

(Source: Holocaust Research Project)\n\n\"From my point of view, all the mysteries around Heinrich Mueller are solved,\" he said at the German Resistance Memorial Centre in the defence ministry in Berlin, where German officers who tried to overthrow Hitler in 1944 were executed.\n\nThe historian was investigating one massacre ordered by Mueller when he came across documents about Mueller's demise.\n\nHe re-examined evidence from a grave-digger after the war, in then communist East Germany, who remembered burying a man in a general's uniform in Berlin-Mitte Jewish Cemetery in 1945.\n\nThe East German police were not interested at the time but Professor Tuchel traced the documents and military decorations found on the body to archives in Berlin and crossed that with data from German intelligence and the US Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nHe concluded that Mueller was dead and traced the corpse to the historic Jewish cemetery dating from the 17th century, where the Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn was also buried.\n\nThe cemetery, which is now a Jewish memorial, was desecrated by the Nazis and became the site of 16 mass graves for more than 2,700 people who died in Allied air raids and the fall of Berlin.\n'Insult to the memory of the Holocaust victims'\n\nDieter Graumann, chairman of the Central Council of Jews, said in a statement it was \"in outrageously bad taste that a brutal Nazi sadist should be buried in a Jewish Cemetery\".\n\n\"It's an insult to the memory of the victims,\" he said.\n\nBut since Jewish religious law forbids exhumations and it would be difficult to identify one body among the thousands buried there, an air of mystery may linger over Mueller.\n\nAs hands-on operational head of the Gestapo, Mueller reported first to Reinhard Heydrich, one of the main architects of the Holocaust, until his assassination in Prague in 1942, and then to Heinrich Himmler, head of the paramilitary SS.\n\nBorn in 1900 and decorated in World War I, Mueller became a policeman before Heydrich recruited him to the SS and Gestapo.\n\nHe attended the 1942 Wannsee Conference which laid out the \"final solution\" - the plan to exterminate the Jews.\n\nProfessor Tuchel described Mueller as a \"bureaucrat\" who, from behind his desk, \"was responsible, with Himmler, Hitler and Heydrich for a lot of mass crimes, was deeply involved in the Holocaust, attended the Wannsee conference and was also responsible for the mass killings of Soviet prisoners of war\".\n\n\"Legends don't die and if someone says tomorrow he has seen Mueller in the Arctic, I won't contradict it,\" Professor Tuchel said.\n\n\"But historical study and speculation are very different things.\"", "title": "Former head of Nazi Gestapo Heinrich Mueller buried in Jewish cemetery", "publishedDate": "2013-11-02T23:22:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "27GBEjoxD1E", "description": "Random", "title": "ceizures", "publishedDate": "2008-04-05T11:18:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "27GJ4WFbFgE", "description": "In this award winning episode, smoker girl hits on some guys in an attempt to get free drinks.", "title": "Smoker Girl", "publishedDate": "2014-10-07T16:17:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "27GZZ98g25k", "description": "Flamed Up (2006) Bonus Track", "title": "Big June - Southeast San Diego", "publishedDate": "2010-12-27T04:58:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "27Ga9q81KRQ", "description": "Clip of Kam Chancellor's Hair Raising Hit of the game.

Paddy fields are a typical feature of rice farming in east, south and southeast Asia. Paddies can be built into steep hillsides as terraces and adjacent to depressed or steeply sloped features such as rivers or marshes. They can require a great deal of labor and materials to create, and need large quantities of water for irrigation. Flooded paddies provide an ideal environment for rice cultivation and discourage the growth of many weeds. Oxen and water buffalo are one of the most important working animals adapted for life in wetlands, and are used extensively in paddy field farming.\n\nIndia has the largest paddy output in the world and is also the fourth largest exporter of rice in the world. In India, Chhattisgarh is Largest Rice producer. Paddy fields are a common sight throughout India, both in the northern gangetic plains and the southern peninsular plateaus. Paddy is cultivated at least twice a year in most parts of India, the two seasons being known as Rabi and Kharif respectively. The former cultivation is dependent on irrigation, while the latter depends on Monsoon. The paddy cultivation plays a major role in socio-cultural life of rural India. Many festivals such as Onam in Kerala, Bihu in Assam, Sankranthi in Andhra Pradesh, Thai Pongal In Tamil Nadu, Makar Sankranti in Karnataka, Nabanna in West Bengal celebrates harvest of Paddy. Kaveri delta region of Thanjavur is historically known as the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu and Kuttanadu is called the rice bowl of Kerala.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

They send their stooge Kanakaraj to assassinate Krishnadeva Raya, but Kanakaraj fails \nin his mission and is put to death. Then they planned courtesan Krishnasini. Krishnasini enters Vijayanagaram, and \nwith her acclaimed dancing skills, manages to elicit the notice of the King, a great connoisseur of arts and beauty. She then plays her cards cleverly and besotted by her intelligent repartees and smoldering sensuousness, the susceptible King is soon a puppet in her hands. Orders are given that anyone who enters their private chamber would be beheaded and the King spends with Krishnasini's for months. Reports reach the ministers that the Sultans are planning to take advantage of the King's inaccessibility and launch a combined attack on Vijayanagaram. Worried at the state of affairs, Tenali Raman braves the prohibitory order and enters Krishnasini's abode dressed as a woman, but all his appeals to the King seem to fall on deaf ears. Meanwhile Queen Tirumalamba falls seriously sick and the King finally comes out of his daze. Once the King is at his wife's bedside, Tenali Ramakrishna \nmanages to gain entry into Krishnasini's house again, this time under the guise of an omniscient saint who assures \nher that he would bring the King back to her. He catches her red-handed with her gang of spies, and signals to the \nhidden soldiers to surround her. Realized that the game is up, Krishnasini prefers a dignified death. Shocked to see \nher stab herself, Timmarusu remonstrates with her that she has acted in haste, for the King would have certainly \nforgiven her.\n\nWatch more movies @\nhttp://www.youtube.com/volgavideo\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/newvolgavideo/videos?view=1", "title": "Tenali Ramakrishna Songs - Aakathayi Pillamooka - ANR, NTR", "publishedDate": "2014-06-27T06:38:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "27MEXtMEddw", "description": "Watch in HD\n\nErica Reyes from Teen Wolf", "title": "Erica Reyes - Sexy Naughty Bitchy me", "publishedDate": "2013-10-13T18:29:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "27McsguL2Og", "description": "University of Manitoba tick expert Kateryn Rochon explains the proper way to remove a tick.\n\nFind out about the blacklegged tick and what makes it unique: http://youtu.be/RTt8R-6y69Q", "title": "How to properly remove a tick", "publishedDate": "2013-06-25T16:02:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "27N05OwTmYI", "description": "Video directed by Oscar Chezwik (thanks to Maxime Ozel and Olivier Godot)\nThis song is taken from the asian version of the album \"Le g\u00e9nie humain\"", "title": "Orwell \"I need an end\"", "publishedDate": "2008-02-14T08:51:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "27NAT5Io1mA", "description": "IF anyone actually ends up watching this video (which I highly doubt), I apologize for its horridness.

The methodology of ARIS is sufficiently refined. Software Ramus is intended for use in projects that require a description of business processes and (or) the establishment of systems of classification and coding.\n\n In addition, each of these points of view shared by all three sublevels: a description of the requirements, a description of the specification, description of implementation. To describe the business processes are encouraged to use about 80 types of models, each of which belongs to one or another aspect. In ARIS representative has a powerful graphics, which makes the model particularly suitable for presentation to management.\n\n Among the large number of possible methods of description are the following:\n * EPC (event-driven process chain) - a method of describing the processes\n has found application in the SAP R / 3;\n * ERM (Entity Relationship Model) - entity-relationship model to describe\n data structures;\n * UML (Unified Modeling Language) - an object-oriented language\n simulation.\n\n Tools ARIS Toolset (ARIS Easy Design) - a unified modeling environment, which is a combination of four main components: Explorer (explorer), Designer (graphical tool for model description), Spreadsheets (for entering the various parameters and attributes), wizards (Wizards).\n\n ARIS Easy Design is focused on gathering information and documentation, while ARIS Toolset is the way to full project management and enables comprehensive analysis of the provided information and semantic validation. In addition, only ARIS Toolset allows you to create scripts (templates) for reporting, analysis and semantic checks built models.\n\n ARIS involve known systems of enterprise management (ERP), namely ARIS Link for R / 3 allows us to describe the structure of the R / 3 in terms of business process management, and, moreover, to reengineer, ie, from R / 3 download ARIS current description of the business - processes, ARIS Analyzer for R / 3 - module for checking for compliance with established models methodology SAP.

Help for the program).\n * Added conversion function classifiers in the elements and vice versa.\n * Added ability to rename the functional blocks and text labels without opening additional windows. The program adds the ability to customize the action when you double-click on the relevant sites: the opening of the window with the properties of the object, or rename the object.\n * Added various methods to improve the appearance of the diagrams (smoothing).\n * Many other minor innovations and improvements.\n Ext.

Venice is renowned for the beauty of its setting, its architecture and its artworks.[2] The city in its entirety is listed as a World Heritage Site, along with its lagoon.[2]\n\nwww.electroonic.de \u00a9 2013 \nwww.youtube.com/ALDreOfficial\n\nVenice is the capital of the Veneto region. In 2009, there were 270,098 people residing in Venice's comune (the population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes the population of the whole Comune of Venezia; around 60,000[3] in the historic city of Venice (Centro storico); 176,000 in Terraferma (the Mainland), mostly in the large frazioni of Mestre and Marghera; 31,000 live on other islands in the lagoon). Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), with a total population of 1,600,000. PATREVE is only a statistical metropolitan area without degree of autonomy.\n\nThe name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC.[4][5] The city historically was the capital of the Venetian Republic. Venice has been known as the \"La Dominante\", \"Serenissima\", \"Queen of the Adriatic\", \"City of Water\", \"City of Masks\", \"City of Bridges\", \"The Floating City\", and \"City of Canals\". Luigi Barzini described it in The New York Times as \"undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man\".[6] Venice has also been described by the Times Online as being one of Europe's most romantic cities.[7]\n\nOrigins\n\nWhile there are no historical records that deal directly with the founding of Venice,[10] tradition and the available evidence have led several historians to agree that the original population of Venice consisted of refugees from Roman cities near Venice such as Padua, Aquileia, Treviso, Altino and Concordia (modern Portogruaro) and from the undefended countryside, who were fleeing successive waves of Germanic and Hun invasions.[11] Some late Roman sources reveal the existence of fishermen on the islands in the original marshy lagoons. They were referred to as incolae lacunae (\"lagoon dwellers\"). The traditional founding is identified with the dedication of the first church, that of San Giacomo at the islet of Rialto (Rivoalto, \"High Shore\"), which is said to have been at the stroke of noon on 25 March 421.[12][13]\n\nThe last and most enduring immigration into the north of the Italian peninsula was that of the Lombards in 568, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire a small strip of coast in the current Veneto, including Venice. The Roman/Byzantine territory was organized as the Exarchate of Ravenna, administered from that ancient port and overseen by a viceroy (the Exarch) appointed by the Emperor in Constantinople, but Ravenna and Venice were connected only by sea routes and with the Venetian's isolated position came increasing autonomy. New ports were built, including those at Malamocco and Torcello in the Venetian lagoon. The tribuni maiores, the earliest central standing governing committee of the islands in the Lagoon, dated from c. 568.[14]", "title": "Venice Hotels, beautiful water city - Venezia Beach [HD]", "publishedDate": "2013-12-06T13:33:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "27PDsoUEJDY", "description": "Learn the best way to communicate with your partner in this free video lesson on swing dancing.\n\nExpert: Ross Safronoff\nRoss Safronoff of Awake Entertainment has a long history with and love for media creation, dance, electronics, software development and anything that fuses creativity with technology.\nFilmmaker: Ross Safronoff\nhttp://AwakeEntertainment.com", "title": "How to Swing Dance : Partner Communication in Swing Dancing", "publishedDate": "2007-09-25T15:36:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "27PqTadLJx0", "description": "SUBSCRIBE for more Spanish videos: http://bit.ly/XGe7we\n\nFollow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/srjordanspanish\n\nTweet me: https://twitter.com/senorjordan\n\nCheck out my website: http://www.senorjordan.com", "title": "Basic Conversation in Spanish - Entire Conversation (Basic)", "publishedDate": "2013-09-28T23:29:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "27QEVLuV7_8", "description": "Film IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1526578/\n\nOfficial film page: http://www.ugcdistribution.fr/ao/le-film/index.php\n\nThis is an excelent french masterpiece, based on recent archeological discoveries about Neandertals and Humans cross-breedings.\n\nIn this scene \"Ao\", the neandertal who is travelling across Europe from Lithuania to Portugal and Spain (the two last stronghold peninsulas of the neandertals), meet agressive Homo Sapiens Sapiens around modern day Germany.\n\nThis clip is an audio-visual complement of my film review, in portuguese.

If you're like most people you have found that the bathtub drain can be a very frustrating repair.  Many times they become clogged with hair or small bathtub toys that kids play with that somehow get pushed down the bathtub drain.  The tool that is used in this video is called a Master extractor.  The purpose of the master extractor is to easily remove fittings such as bathtub drains sink drains, and pipe nipples.  It will literally take a job that would take hours down to just a few minutes.  The Master Extractor is made out of stainless steel and it won't rust and will not break (unless you run it over with a tank) according to the warranty if for any reason it does break it comes with a lifetime warranty!  As you can see in the video the Master Extractor easily fits onto a half inch socket wrench or an impact wrench.  The Master Extractor has been tested up to seven thousand five hundred foot pounds.  It has been ISO inspected and passed the industry's highest standards.  The Master Extractor was invented by a Die hard American and a Marine Veteran who claims this will always be made in American with the highest quality!\nIf you are like most people and are looking for a way to quickly and easily repair your bathtub drain then this video should explain how quickly it can be done.  Regardless of your level of skill it only takes a few tools to get the job done.\nIn this video the man shows how quickly he can remove and replace the bathtub drain.  I think he was just trying to show how quick it can be done because if you are replacing yours you will want to clean the area around the bathtub drain of all dirt and debris.  Then you will put some plumbers putty around it so it will keep it from leaking.  I am not sure why the guy would not do that in the video unless he was just trying to show off the speed of the tool.  It is also a good idea to take a shop vac and suck out all the gung that may be down in the drain.\nI think that the Master Extractor costs around seventy five dollars and can be purchased at http://www.ebathtubdrain.com/ if you don't find it there I am sure if you search on Google you will be able to find it somewhere on the web if you are searching for bathtub drain.  I just read in a comment on another video that a girl was able to replace her bathtub drain using this tool she claimed it was very easy!  ;-)\nWell if you like the video be sure and subscribe to the eBathtubDrain YouTube channel and leave us a comment about your experience with fixing your bathtub drain.

The idea to establish a national park in the Austrian Alps arose around the turn of the century. It took more than 80 years to this idea into practice. Apart from protecting the nature in this alpine area, the objective is to bring the natural wealth to the attention of as many people as possible. \nThe park has especially vulnerable peripheral and core areas.\nMany glaciated valleys with picturesque places, rippling streams, and magnificent flora. The core areas in Hohe Tauern have special protection. \nThe peripheral areas are less vulnerable.\nNowadays there are still places with production forests, although this number is gradually being reduced. Natural rejuvenation is being given a chance. Depending on the altitude and climate, the area can be divided into rocky, mountainous Alps, alpine grasslands, larch/beech forest, spruce forest, broad-leaved and mixed forest and, all the way down, the mountain dales. Each has its' own plant and animal communities.\n\n\nInfo HighRes Imagery: http://www.stockshot.nl/\n\u00a9 All Rights reserved by Fauna Film B.V. http://www.faunafilm.nl", "title": "Grossglockner alpine road in Hohe Tauern national park", "publishedDate": "2011-11-10T06:34:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "27ZSHThN0tc", "description": "Carol Cornell, papal historian, joins Melissa Long on 21Alive to discuss expectations of Pope Francis I's pontificate.", "title": "Carroll Cornell On Francis' Papacy", "publishedDate": "2013-03-14T02:38:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "27ZhZLqMbYA", "description": "For more GTA 5 Online, GTA 5 Heist, GTA 5 DLC !

EMALS lowers overall operating costs and reduces maintenance over current steam catapults, and provides less 'wear and tear' on carrier-based aircraft. EMALS also expands the mission envelope by launching a broader range of naval aircraft with less stress on the ship and aircraft systems. Implementation of the EMALS system for the Ford-class will meet the Navy's fixed-wing launch capability, while offering the flexibility to support future carrier air wings.\n\nEMALS technology was fundamentally proven by the Navy in 2004 using a full-scale, half-length prototype, where more than 1,500 launches and armature maneuvers were conducted. Since 2008, component testing on the shipboard design has been underway, including full scale/full power tests of all components. A full scale test site at Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst, N.J., will be operational winter 2010.\n\nEMALS will begin operational aircraft launch testing summer 2010.  \n\nClick to subscribe! http://bit.ly/subAIRBOYD", "title": "Navy Tests Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS)", "publishedDate": "2010-12-21T21:39:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "27kAjqiLt28", "description": "I keep on seeing this algae in my saltwater tank and I dont know what it is it looked more brown earlier today and i used the vacuum to get some of it out and my clownfish just recovered from white spots disease", "title": "Cyano Bacteria", "publishedDate": "2011-08-17T02:21:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "27kKZEaUW4s", "description": "South African Music", "title": "Philemon Zulu - Washo We Giligi", "publishedDate": "2009-04-05T18:03:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "27kP9DxWNsg", "description": "Dean Ambrose Ringside Fest 2014 Entrance LIVE COVERAGE!

Fulham, December 3rd, 2010\n\n\nI had advised my readers and UFOlogist supporters I would notify them by e-mail on the next major UFO display in their 'intervention process' with mankind which started in their major display over New York on 13th October 2010. The prediction, documented in my book Challenges of Change (Third printing in March, 2010) stated that \"that there would be a major display over our principal cities\" on that was a great deal of speculation about this change in the Transcendors prediction. In late September 2010 I asked the Transcendors about this significant change. They replied: \"The Pleiadians are much more aware of the consciousness of mankind than you are\u2014after all they have been observing you for millions of years. They came to the conclusion that mankind (generally speaking) is not prepared for a massive display of their UFOs over our principal cities. They would regard it as a hostile intervention\u2014a prelude to invasion. Accordingly, the Alien Council decided about three-weeks before their 'display' they would focus on one of our principal cities, New York. It is recognized worldwide as our most cosmopolitan city with a population not likely to be overwhelmed by the sight of UFOs; however, the 'display' date of 13 October 2010 would remain. There were other major UFO sightings on that date all over the world. But the Transcendors caution that they were not part of the Council's principal focus over New York. The New York display is simply the beginning of the Alien's \"intervention my last 'Reading' with the Transcendors on Tuesday, October 13th, 2010, the Transcendors advised me of the following predictions on the Pleiadian UFO displays:\n\nA. There will be a major UFO display over Moscow between the end of the first part of January 2011 and the second week of January 2011.\n\nB. This 'display' will be followed by a major display over London approximately seven-days later.\n\nC. Interventions will then accelerate, not so much over our cities, but dispersed over our continents with sightings increasing in duration. The intent of these interventions is to increase mankind's acceptance of the alien phenomena, so that hopefully, we will be prepared to accept a face-to-face encounter and communicate, perhaps as early as next year (2011).\n\nD. Objective\u2014a dramatic introduction of the alien reality\u2014an appearance at the United Alien 'intervention process' will provide a philosophical challenge to mankind as nothing else has ever done. It will challenge our most fundamental beliefs. Did Christ teach to this extraterrestrial world? Are they aware of Allah and his hatred for the heathens and infidels (which, of course, must include the aliens\u2014they also have souls!). Do they have any religions?\u2014or spiritualism?\n\nThe UFO 'intervention process' will have a major impact on the U.S. and Russian governments. This will be the catalyst that will break the \"conspiracy of can then divert their focus to the challenges the new alien technologies will bring to to my declining health, this may be my last writing on this subject. In the meantime, I wish all my readers and 'UFOlogist' supporters the very best in their future \n - Stanley A.

I've been flying professionally for about 13 years, and now I have the pleasure of flying this Gulfstream G450 which is a lot of fun and exciting. And today I'm going to talk to you about becoming a pilot. So how are you going to get your license? Well, depends on which program you take, but you're going to have to complete a certain amount of hours, flight hours, which will include instruction given and some solo flight time. And when you get a minimum of between 35 and 40 hours, although it takes most people at least 60 hours on average, you're going to go ahead and take a written exam. A written exam is about two and a half hours, and once you pass that you're going to take an oral and a flight exam with an FAA designated examiner. Let me add something about the written test,you might be nervous or it sounds pretty ominous,it's really not that bad, and your instructor is not going to let you take any of these tests until you're comfortable and he or she feel that you're ready to take it. Some of the tests involve math, which I was not good at when I was younger. You still will figure it out, it's really not that hard. It just takes time and dedication and discipline to learn some of the concepts, learn some of the terminology,but all stuff that with time, practice, and studying, you'll get it.

He was always seeking to\n   lead people back from the impoverished life in which the currents are\n   sluggish, and the arteries are hardened, and all the movements are\n   stiff and formal. He would constrain us back into the realm of vital\n   freedom where life is liquid and musical, and where intercourse is\n   natural and unconventional. \"Except ye turn, and become as little\n   children!\" That was a tone of warning, as that indeed is the line of\n   promise. If our life is to be wholesome and progressive we must\n   repeatedly turn from the age of stone, which comes with the years, to\n   the plastic and unexhausted susceptibility of a little child.\n\n   Lord Morley has somewhere said that simplification is the keynote of\n   the Reformation. It pierced behind the artificial and conventional to\n   the natural man and natural life. But this is surely true of every\n   healthy revolution: its movement is from the complicated to the single,\n   from the technical to the vital, from the merely traditional to the\n   original springs. Its tendency is from palsied age to the little child.\n\n   Crises continually arise which compel us to get rid of exhausting\n   encumbrances. We have become overburdened with the multiplication of\n   harness. It is not always the ordinary load of life which crushes us;\n   it is the increasingly heavy and complicated means which we have\n   devised to draw it. Our yoke is more galling than our burden; the\n   harness is more harassing than the load. The complications increase\n   with the years. Society becomes a steel network of hard artificial\n   bonds, instead of remaining a sweet, elastic and lovely fellowship.\n   Prayer becomes fossilised. Theology grows arid and technical. Public\n   worship becomes mere church-going, as tedious as the making of\n   conventional social calls. \"She has God on her visiting list!\" Think of\n   the formality and artificiality which hide behind that vivid phrase!\n   Everything grows hard and unelastic in the conventional drip, drip of a\n   petrifying formality.\n\n   And so there is imperative need of crises and revolutions which will\n   compel us to seek a simplification of life and thought and feeling, and\n   which will make us turn again and become as a little child. And may not\n   this be one of the deep secrets of the time through which we are\n   passing, and may not this divine simplification be one of its glorious\n   issues? Things were becoming fearfully stiff and conventional. Now we\n   are going to become more natural, which will mean more fraternal, more\n   genially accessible to one another, more reverently hospitable to our\n   Lord. We are going to learn of Him, and in meekness and lowliness we\n   shall find that our yoke is easy and our burden is light.", "title": "The Simplification of Life", "publishedDate": "2014-07-01T21:30:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "27x5n2ZVgvE", "description": "Please Subscibe By Clicking The Link Below.

(The outer portion is the adrenal cortex).\n\nThe adrenal medulla makes epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Epinephrine is secreted in response to low blood levels of glucose as well as exercise and stress; it causes the breakdown of the storage product glycogen to the sugar glucose in the liver, facilitates the release of fatty acids from adipose (fat) tissue, causes dilation (widening) of the small arteries within muscle and increases the output of the heart. Norepinephrine secreted by the adrenal gland acts to narrow blood vessels and raise blood pressure.\n\nUnderfunction of the adrenal medulla is virtually unknown. However, a tumor called a pheochromocytoma produces norepinephrine and epinephrine and is equivalent to overfunction of the adrenal medulla. Pheochromocytomas arise within the adrenal medulla or elsewhere in the sympathetic nervous system. They typically cause hypertension (high blood pressure) that may be paroxysmal (sharply episodic) with attacks of headaches, feelings of apprehension, sweating, flushing of the face, nausea and vomiting, palpitations and tingling of the extremities (the arms and legs).\n\n\n\n\n\nmedical terminology, medical dictionary, medical dictionary free download, medical terminology made easy, medical terminology song", "title": "What Is The Definition Of Adrenal medulla Medical Dictionary Free Online", "publishedDate": "2014-09-09T18:17:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "2878-RQ5Fr8", "description": "Boot camp for first time teenage offenders encounter the giant Paul Bunyan. ...And he is not a nice guy.

Our women are often at the receiving end of pity because they are believed to be subjected and persecuted. Where to start and where to begin here?\n\nThrough this post, I would like to introduce you to the Fata I have spent my entire life in by busting some popular myths about this region.\nIn Fata,women are to remain illiterate and house-bound\nPlease do not believe everything you read.\nIn all fairness, there are problems here due to the law and order situation. Nevertheless, several tribal females do pursue education within this region.  Many of my female cousins, including my sister, have graduated from renowned colleges in Fata. This is true for other families in my neighbourhood as well.\nThere are 13 girls\u2019 degree-colleges, out of which 11 are currently operational. Thousands of female students pursue education in these colleges while roughly 200,000 girls are currently enrolled in government-run primary, middle and secondary schools. These figures do not include the thousands who are enrolled in private schools.\nThough there is no co-education at secondary or college level, private schools have co-education at primary and middle school level.\nWe require schools for our children, hospitals for our ill and playgrounds for exertion. We need industrial activity, agriculture and business growth to earn a living. We need roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects to facilitate mobility for us. We need electricity, water, sanitation, waste disposal and other services including social uplift projects. We need telephones, mobile phones and the internet to keep abreast with the latest developments in the world.\nOur needs and wants are hardly any different from those of typical \u2018human beings\u2019.\n\n\nI created this video with the YouTube Video Editor (http://www.youtube.com/editor)", "title": "Woman life in Fata Pakistan", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T01:41:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "28Ca7LY2Ab8", "description": "", "title": "131024 [SS5MANILA FANCAM] Wonderboy SJ + henwook focus", "publishedDate": "2013-10-25T03:09:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "28Cb6aI-vyA", "description": "Comparing my good hand with my akinetic hand.", "title": "Akinesia Example", "publishedDate": "2012-12-25T23:52:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "28DW4Vlb8XQ", "description": "Boss RC-2 Looper / clean first / later with Okko Diablo Gain+ Overdrive /  Amp: Fender Vibroverb (original 1963), Vahlbruch Spacetime Delay, Korg Pitchblack Tuner.\n\nFor more infos on my recording equipment and other questions check my homepage: www.gregorhilden.de \nCheck the guitars for sale site and see \"question + answers\"", "title": "(my personal) 2011 Gibson SG \"Std.

It is worn out of respect for God.  The rules of how and when to wear Kippah are highly debated in Jewish Law.\n\nJewish Rabbinical law dictates that a man is required to cover his head during prayer. In the Middle Ages a larger Kippah meant you were more religious.  Kippahs were used as a way to discriminate between Jews and Non-Jews. \n\nToday, the kippah have become a commodity and can be found representing sports teams, cartoon characters, and political figures.  Woman and babies have also begun wearing the Kippah.    \n\nThe only reference we have in Torah of head coverings are that of Turbans or mourners rags.  The high priests wore a Turban and many Royal figures, also many outside of Judaism wore turbans. \n\nSome argue that, many of these Jewish traditions came as an Identity crisis due to attempt of survival as a people outside of Israel.  As a result, Jews have put more faith in their traditions and legalism than in the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob. \n\nWearing a Kippah is fun and it is a great way to identify with today's Jewish communities but remember that the Kippah was originally worn to remind us of who God is. \n\nAnd that is The Kippah in 60 seconds.\n\nSubscribe today and become a fan\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Parshain60", "title": "History of the Kippah in 60 Seconds", "publishedDate": "2012-11-15T17:11:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "28K77OWa1gs", "description": "Sufruli", "title": "Sufruli- Avada var avada", "publishedDate": "2012-02-18T20:38:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "28KOYyT56Rg", "description": "Opening track off debut album \"Starfucker\" Released in 2008 by Badman Recording Co.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/s********r/id290359552", "title": "STRFKR // Florida", "publishedDate": "2013-01-04T09:33:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "28KU0VGK_7Q", "description": "This movie shows the activation of G-Protein Coupled Receptor (Beta-2 Adrenergic Receptor) made using the atomistic simulations of the receptor on Google Exacycle.", "title": "Cloud-based simulations on Google Exacycle reveal ligand-modulation of GPCR activation pathways.", "publishedDate": "2014-05-26T19:45:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "28KZYkAacpw", "description": "Here are the steps.\n1.

Service is best known for his poems \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" and \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\", from his first book, Songs of a Sourdough (1907; also published as The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses). \"These humorous tales in verse were considered doggerel by the literary set, yet remain extremely popular to this day.\" Robert W. Service was born in Preston, Lancashire, England, the first of ten children. His father, also Robert Service, was a banker from Kilwinning, Scotland, who had been transferred to England. At five years old Robert W. Service went to live in Kilwinning with his three maiden aunts and his paternal grandfather, who was the town's postmaster. There he is said to have composed his first verse, a grace, on his sixth birthday: \"God bless the cakes and bless the jam; Bless the cheese and the cold boiled ham; Bless the scones Aunt Jeannie makes, And save us all from bellyaches. Amen\"\n\nIn 1913, Service arrived in Paris, where he would live for the next 15 years. He settled in the Latin Quarter, posing as a painter. In June 1913, he married Parisienne Germaine Bourgoin, daughter of a distillery owner, and they purchased a summer home at Lancieux, C\u00f4tes-d'Armor, in the Brittany region of France. Thirteen years younger than her husband, Germaine Service lived 31 years following his death, dying at age 102 in 1989. Robert Service was 41 when World War I broke out; he enlisted, but was turned down \"due to varicose veins.\" He briefly covered the war for the Toronto Star (from December 11, 1915 through January 29, 1916), but \"was arrested and nearly executed in an outbreak of spy hysteria in Dunkirk.\" -- then \"worked as a stretcher bearer and ambulance driver with the Ambulance Corps of the American Red Cross, until his health broke.\" Convalescing in Paris, he wrote a new book of mainly war poetry, Rhymes of a Red Cross Man, in 1916. The book was dedicated to the memory of Service's \"brother, Lieutenant Albert Service, Canadian Infantry, Killed in Action, France, August 1916.\"\n\nWith the end of the war, Service  settled down to being a rich man in Paris.... During the day he would promenade in the best suits, with a monocle. At night he went out in old clothes with the company of his doorman, a retired policeman, to visit the lowest dives of the city.. During his time in Paris he was reputedly the wealthiest author living in the city, yet was known to dress as a working man and walk the streets, blending in and observing everything around him. Those experiences would be used in his next book of poetry, Ballads of a Bohemian (1921), The poems are given in the persona of an American poet in Paris who serves as an ambulance driver and an infantryman in the war. The verses are separated by diary entries over a period of four years.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "title": "Robert W  Service - Comfort", "publishedDate": "2013-11-24T19:20:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "28PJPSms_xU", "description": "http://www.aei.org/economicgrowth  If we truly care about helping the poor, we should prioritize economic growth, which is the key to lifting whole societies from poverty to prosperity.

In addition to the best-selling 9'6, 10'6 and 11'6 all-around models, two new boards now round out the ACE-TEC range, the 12'6 & 11' WINGs, which are the result of serious development work by our international team of riders, most notably Eric Terrien. With a hull design that is stable, smooth and efficient, the WING models are ideally suited for general touring, longer outings and fitness sessions. There are also three specialty boards for added versatility; a 10'6 WIND windsurf model with deck mast-track, an 11'6 WIND windsurf model with mast-track and retractable daggerboard, as well as the 10'6 FIT-SUP (Fitness-SUP) with a full-length deck pad and deck attachment points. \n\u2022 DURA-TEC, as the name implies, features BIC's legendary durability in an exclusive, nearly indestructible construction technology. DURA-TEC boards, available in 9'4, 10'4 and 11'4, are user-friendly with solid performance at a budget-friendly price. They are ideal for families, clubs, schools and novices looking for value and low-maintenance, stress-free performance.\n\u2022 With its eye-catching Clear-Epoxy construction, the new C-TEC range combines a classic aesthetic with the solid strength of a real bamboo reinforced deck. C-TEC features two board series each with three sizes for optimal performance: \nthe Classic Wood series, designed for all-around versatility and the Wave Pro series, pure wave machines with enough stability for easy access to true surfing performance. \n\u2022 RACE-TEC boards feature Eric Terrien's winning race shapes fine-tuned for no-compromise race performance. Lightweight and high-tech, available in 12'6 and 14' sizes. Fast and forgiving, the perfect blend for race success.\n\u2022 Not to be overlooked are the SUP AIR and SUP SOFT series. For riders who like to travel far and light the new 10' and 10'6 AIR models feature thicker, wider and more rigid designs. Families and schools will really appreciate the 10' and 11' SOFT models with their comfortable, resilient outer skin, designed for maximum safety and flexibility for beginner riders.\n\nYour paddle connects you to the water and allows you to efficiently get where you're looking to go.

Number theory, which deals with the properties of integers, is known as the \"Queen of Mathematics.\" The Bannai Group is focused especially on arithmetic geometry.\nArithmetic geometry utilizes methods and results from algebraic geometry. In this field, number theoretical problems are investigated via the geometric properties of geometric objects defined by algebraic equations.\n\nQ. \"Humans perceive things in two ways, logically and intuitively. Logic involves calculating things precisely.  On the other hand, when using intuition, especially geometric intuition, we look at a problem in a certain geometric way and immediately \"know\" the answer.\nIf one asks how this can be applied to problems in number theory, for example, consider the problem of finding rational solutions of the equation \nx2 + y2 = 1.  The problem of seeking rational solutions of an algebraic equation is a number theoretical problem.  Geometry comes into the picture if one thinks of the equation x2 + y2 = 1 as expressing a unit circle.\nWhen I use the word geometric intuition, what I mean is, it is much easier to solve this problem if one thinks that the equation x2 + y2 = 1 is not simply an algebraic equation but also that it represents a circle.\"\n\nUsing methods from arithmetic geometry, Andrew Wiles in 1995 solved the Fermat's Last Theorem, which had puzzled mathematicians for 300 years.  Number theory can be applied for example to cryptography, which is an important practical application of number theory to society. \n\nQ. \"Because number theory concerns integers s -- 1, 2, 3, and so on -- one might think it's a very narrow field.  At first, I also imagined that number theory was a very narrow topic; I wanted to do mathematics, but number theory did not seem all that interesting. But when I learned that problems in number theory were deeply related to geometry and also to analysis through various interesting analytic functions, I realized that number theory was a very deep field related to a wide range of areas in mathematics. That's what's fascinating about number theory. Rather than being superficial, because number theory deals with integers, which is a very fundamental object of study, it is deeply related to many interesting theories in the forefront of mathematics.\"\n\nSince the dawn of civilization, numbers and equations were used to better understand natural phenomena. Through abstraction, mathematics has greatly expanded its range of application.  The Bannai Group will continue to do research, in order to understand through logic and intuition abstract phenomena appearing in number theory.", "title": "Arithmetic Geometry - solving number theoretical problems using geometrical intuition", "publishedDate": "2012-03-26T03:21:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "28iFRfRe0FI", "description": "What happens when you unintentionally violate a law of Shabbat?

This salt solution humidifies the air, the oak and the surface of the lead. Oak is known to emit more volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at higher relative humidities. The deliquescence-crystallization behaviour of the sodium chloride crystals in the open tube indicates a possible upper threshold of 76% relative humidity in the chamber over time. \n\n6.9 hours: The development of a thin film of white corrosion products indicates the first visible evidence for the beginning of lead corrosion.\n\n6.9 days: The formerly grey surface is entirely converted into, and/or covered by, a thin white film of lead corrosion products.\n\n1.1 to 3.3 months: The single salt crystal closest to the chamber atmosphere cyclically absorbs and desorbs water vapour. And it is the first to deliquesce. \n\n3.8 months onwards: The saturated salt solution appears to have finally produced a relative humidity of 76%. The equilibrium moisture content of the oak at this relative humidity is reached.\n\nPost-exposure: Here the lead before and after exposure is compared. Analysis of the surface with X-ray diffraction (XRD) following the 2-year exposure detected various acetates, oxides and carbonates of lead. The specific compounds are considered in a forthcoming publication.\n\nAcetates of lead include some of the compounds produced by vinegar (or more precisely, acetic acid) and other vapours emitted by oak. Some other timbers and construction materials also emit these air pollutants.   \n\nVinegar dissolves the protective lead oxide and carbonate layers; causing more corrosion of the lead metal. The corrosion mechanisms of lead-rich alloys vary, so their effects range from obscuring surface details to provoking structural collapse.\n\nThere are many types and sources of indoor and outdoor air pollutants, with many other materials being affected. If left unprotected, and polluted air remains unventilated or unfiltered, pollutants accumulate and accelerate deterioration.\n\nAt risk are significant indoor cultural heritage collections like those found in libraries (books, manuscripts), churches (tapestries, silverware, pipe organs), art galleries (paintings, sculptures) and museums (artefacts, natural history specimens).\n\nCultural heritage collections are irreplaceable, and prevention of their deterioration is preferable to restoration.

Napoleon Hill believed that if you think the right thoughts you can. In 1937, he published the book \"Think and Grow Rich.\" Napoleon Hill spent many years researching financial success and observing people who had become rich. Although it was published in the middle of The Great Depression, it was an immediate success. \"Think and Grow Rich\" remains one of the most-popular non-fiction books ever written. Forbes magazine says it has sold 70 million copies since it first appeared, and continues to sell today. Napoleon Hill wrote at least ten other books about success before his death in 1970. None of Hill's books came close to selling as many copies as \"Think and Grow Rich.\" But for today's generation, \"Think and Grow Rich\" is now available in a different form. SmarterComics has released an illustrated version of the book. Franco Arda is the company's founder and publisher. He used to work as an investment banker. He started the company three years ago with his own money. He wanted to create picture books that increase understanding. His versions provide much of the information that is in full-length books but in an easy-to-understand, picture, or comic, form. Franco Arda says readers will understand and remember more about gaining success if they read the comic book version of \"Think and Grow Rich.\" He says pictures make the book easier to remember.He says the book taught him to change the way he thinks about money and success. SmarterComics says the book tells how \"wealth is a lifelong pursuit achieved by believing in the value of personal ideas.\" It says anyone can achieve their dreams by refusing to be stopped by temporary problems.

That's  why  we  all  are  cordially  thankful  to  this  magnificent  organ.  By  the  bye,  Recently  the  number  of  breast  cancer  patients  has  increased  in  such  an  alarming  rate  that  i  am  to  develop  a  homeopathic  self-treatment  scheme  for  these  vast  number  of  breast  cancer  patients  to  save  them  from  horrific  suffering  and  unwanted  death.  Take  these  eleven  homeopathic  medicines  (as  a  cure  for  breast  cancer)  according  to  my  direction.  I  am  optimistic  that  my  formula  will  give  a  full  cure  for  99%  of  breast  cancer  patients.  Although  few  cases  will  not  get  full  cure ;  still  they  will  get  ten  fold  better  result  than  any  other  healing  systems.  Take  these  medicines  repeatedly  in  a  cyclical  way  (i.e.  after  no. - 11  start  again  from  no. - 1).  Yea,  it  is  better  to  take  all  homeopathic  medicines  in  empty  stomach ;  but  you  can  take  them  after  meal  if  you  forget.  You  can  take  these  homeopathic  medicines  along  with  other  allopathic  or  herbal  medicines (whether  they  may  be  tablet,  capsule  or  injection).  They  will  not  cause  any  trouble.  But  it  is  better  to  take  all  homeopathic  medicines  half  an  hour  before  or  after  other  medicines.  Try  to  buy  Germany  or  U.S.A.  made  homeopathic  medicines. \nRx\n\n   (1)  Thuja  occidentalis                     CM      \n (Take  this  homeopathic  medicine  1  drop  /  5  pills   only  one  dose.)\n    (2)  Kali  Phosphoricum / Calcarea  Phosphoricum   3x/6x/12x \n(Then  take  these  two  homeopathic  medicines  5  pills  daily  for   02  weeks.

Some Western states have also participated in some of the strikes in Iraq.\n\nSince late September, the US and some of its Arab allies -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates -- have been carrying out airstrikes against ISIL inside Syria without any authorization from Damascus or a UN mandate.\n\nHarris, of the #Veterans #Today, said, \u201cWe had a series of whistleblowers come forward and tell us about the 90,000 bank accounts that have been discovered and detected through the Union Bank of Switzerland, but there has been no action on this.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur own Congress has been notified of this and they\u2019re still taking no action on this. Significant members of armed services got familiar [with it]\u2026and yet they are doing nothing to track down where the martial support for ISIS is coming from. This is embarrassment,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that this implies treason at \u201cthe highest levels within the US government.

The NH2-terminal region of caspase-8 contains two death effector domains (DEDs), through which it binds the DED of Fas-associated death domain (FADD). The COOH-terminal region of caspase-8 is related to the interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) family of proteases. FADD mediates the recruitment of caspase-8 to tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1), where caspase-8 becomes activated, presumably by self-cleavage, and in turn initiates a proteolytic cascade that ultimately leads to apoptosis.\n\nTwo important examples of the direct initiation of apoptotic mechanisms in mammals include the TNF-induced (tumour necrosis factor) model and the Fas-Fas ligand-mediated model, both involving receptors of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family coupled to extrinsic signals. TNF is a cytokine produced mainly by activated macrophages, and is the major extrinsic mediator of apoptosis. Most cells in the human body have two receptors for TNF: TNF-R1 and TNF-R2. The binding of TNF to TNF-R1 has been shown to initiate the pathway that leads to caspase activation via the intermediate membrane proteins TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) and Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD).\nDesign & production: Kosi Gramatikoff, PhD and John C.

when buying one unless you are buying a draft horse or pony. Here are some buying tips.\n\n\nStep 1: Go to a tackle shop\nGo to a feed and tackle shop or check the internet if you are in the market for a new horse bridle.\n\nTip\nAs an alternative, check bulletin boards or classified ads for used bridles. If you opt for a used bridle, make sure the stitching is tight.\n\nStep 2: Choose a snaffle bridle\nChoose a standard snaffle bridle if you ride English style. If your horse is difficult to control, consider a snaffle bridle with a flash nose band or drop nose.\n\nStep 3: Choose a dressage bridle\nChoose a dressage bridle if you plan to compete in dressage events.\n\nStep 4: Choose a Western bridle\nChoose a traditional Western bridle, bosal, or a mechanical hackamore bridle for Western-style riding.\n\nTip\nThese bridles do not have nose bands.\n\nStep 5: Check the brow band\nMake sure the brow band fits your horse's head.

It is hard for many people to tell the difference and there are many subtle differences with various types of the two herbs.  In many cases I have found Oregano to be called wild marjoram or sweet marjoram since it is so close.\n\n\n\nJust the other day, at a California farmers market, a nursery sales person tried to sell me Marjoram but said it was Oregano.  Since I had been growing both for about six months I mentioned that I thought it may be Marjoram which only received a confused response. This may not make much of a difference if you are looking at drying or crushing the herbs but once you taste them you should experience a greater difference.  As an example if you put Marjoram on your pizza it may taste great but it will taste very different than crushed oregano.\n\nMajoram\n\nMarjoram\nThe Marjoram mentioned here I started from seed in a small outdoor greenhouse during December (Zone 10). I then transplanted it into a small one gallon container with compost and other amendments to help with drainage. It had a high germination rate and was said to be used as a companion plant to the pepper plants that are also growing close by. The Marjoram has a thinner leaf than Oregano and grows differently. I believe it tastes like combination of a citrus and a pine.\n\nThe antioxidant value of Marjoram, fresh described in ORAC units is:\n27,297 \u03bc mol TE/100g.\n\n~USDA\n\nOregano\n\nOregano\nThis Oregano was purchased from a local nursery in a small container.  It was then transplanted into a few gallon containers with compost.  Oregano has a much wider leaf, seems to grow more slowly, and has a very high antioxidant level dried and fresh.  I believe it tastes bitter and spicy.\n\nThe antioxidant value of Spices, oregano, dried described in ORAC units is:\n175,295 \u03bc mol TE/100g.\n\nThe antioxidant value of Oregano, fresh described in ORAC units is:\n13,970 \u03bc mol TE/100g.\n\n~USDA\n\nBoth plants almost completely stopped growing during the winter but now that it has heated up they are both taking off and taste great.  I have also found that putting them in more direct sun and picking the tops of the herb in the morning just before the sun comes up may increase the flavor.  I enjoy both Oregano and Marjoram however they are not as easy to grow for the novice gardener as other herbs like pineapple sage.", "title": "Oregano vs. Marjoram -- Mint Family Perennial Herbs In Kitchen Garden", "publishedDate": "2011-05-01T13:34:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "29cmK7BvWUE", "description": "http://www.Kranktv.com/ - Rivers of Nihil - \"(sin)chronos\"  -  Like this video?

Through emigration, small Kalmyk communities have been established in the United States, France, Germany, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic.\nThe Kalmyks are a branch of the Oirats whose ancient grazing lands are now located in Kazakhstan, Russia, Mongolia and the People's Republic of China. After the fall of the Yuan Dynasty in 1368, the Oirats emerged as a formidable foe against the Eastern Mongols, the Ming Chinese and their successor, the Manchu who founded the Qing Dynasty, in a nearly 400 year military struggle for domination and control over both Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia.

Frankish, Lloyd Levin\nScreenwriter: W.P. Kinsella, Phil Alden Robinson\nFilm Description: \"If you build it, he will come.\" That's the ethereal message that inspires Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) to construct a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield. At first, \"he\" seems to be the ghost of disgraced ballplayer Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta), who materializes on the ballfield and plays a few games with the awestruck Ray. But as the weeks go by, Ray receives several other messages from a disembodied voice, one of which is \"Ease his pain.\" He realizes that his ballfield has been divinely ordained to give a second chance to people who have sacrificed certain valuable aspects of their lives. One of these folks is Salingeresque writer Terence Mann (James Earl Jones), whom Ray kidnaps and takes to a ball game and then to his farm. Another is Doc Graham (Burt Lancaster), a beloved general practitioner who gave up a burgeoning baseball career in favor of medicine. The final \"second-chancer\" turns out to be much closer to Ray. That \"magical\" field in Dyersville, Iowa still draws thousands of baseball-happy tourists each year.\n\n\"field of dreams\",\"field of dreams clip\",\"field of dreams trailer\",\"field of dreams 2\",\"kevin costner\",\"ray liotta\",\"james earl jones\",\"phil alden robinson\",\"sports dramas\",\"ages 11-12\",baseball,drama,\"dramas based on the book\",\"family drama\",\"sports stories\",\"lloyd levin\",\"brian e frankish\",\"acceptance videos\",\"choice videos\",\"preparation videos\",\"basketball game videos\",\"farm videos\",\"ray kinsella\",\"terence terry mann\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++17120,/m/0127m7,/m/0f6_x,/m/02j490", "title": "Field of Dreams (7/9) Movie CLIP - Ray's Not Invited (1989) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T12:56:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "29nUyTc4MGs", "description": "Noam Chomsky talks about the IMF and the role that it plays today in our world.", "title": "Noam Chomsky on the IMF(International Monetary Fund).", "publishedDate": "2011-10-19T00:31:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "29naJG4TEOU", "description": "\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d, \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u041c\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440-\u043d, \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0435, 05 \u043d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2011 \u0433., \u041e.\u041b\u044f\u0445\u043e\u0432 (priirtyshje.kz)", "title": "Vulpes corsac.flv", "publishedDate": "2012-03-11T15:38:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "29naJSz_l9E", "description": "Found this creepy looking thing crawling up my front door during a rainstorm in central Arkansas.

The White House, his family and employer said they could not determine the video's authenticity and were attempting to confirm if he had been killed.\n\nFoley, a 40-year-old freelance journalist from Rochester, New Hampshire, went missing nearly two years ago in northern Syria while on assignment for Agence France-Press and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost. The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control. He had not been heard from since.\n\nAt the end of the video, a militant shows a second man, who was identified as another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, and warns that he could be killed. Sotloff was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border in August 2013 and freelanced for Time, the National Interest and MediaLine.\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama was briefed about the video on Air Force One as he flew from Washington to resume his vacation on the resort island of Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. A White House statement said Obama would continue to receive regular updates.\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the administration has seen the video and that the intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine if it is authentic.\n\n\"If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,\" Hayden said in a statement.\n\nApproached by an Associated Press reporter at her home, Foley's mother, Diane Foley, was red-eyed and gracious Tuesday afternoon but said the family would not make an immediate statement. A priest arrived at the home several hours later.\n\nPhilip Balboni, GlobalPost CEO and co-founder, said the company had been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video to determine whether it was authentic. \"We ask for your prayers for Jim and his family,\" he said.\n\nSeveral senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the last two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar, the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil.\n\nBoth areas are in northern Iraq, which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the hostage situation by name.\n\nSince Aug. 8, the U.S. military has struck more than 70 Islamic State targets \u2014 including security checkpoints, vehicles and weapons caches. It's not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes, although it's likely that some were.\n\nThe Internet video of the apparent beheading appears to show the increasing sophistication of the Islamic State group's media arm. It begins with scenes of Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes in Iraq. Then it switches to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert, a black-clad Islamic State fighter by his side. Foley's name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen. Foley went missing in Syria in November 2012.\n\nThe scene is captured on at least two video cameras, and has been edited in a professional style. The video appears to have been shot in an arid area; there is no vegetation in sight and the horizon is in the distance where the sand meets the gray-blue sky.\n\nThe Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al-Qaida's leaders. In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control, the extremists have slain soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying executions \u2014 including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes.\n\nFoley's purported beheading would mark the first time the Islamic State has killed an American citizen since the Syrian conflict broke out in March 2011, upping the stakes in an increasingly chaotic and multilayered war. If confirmed, the killing is likely to complicate U.S. involvement in Iraq and the Obama administration's efforts to contain the group as it expands in both Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al-Qaida in Iraq, which beheaded many of its victims, including Americans businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004.\n\n\"James Foley Death ISIS Beheads Kidnapped US Journalist James Foley RAW VIDEO Reaction\"\n\"James Foley Death ISIS Beheads Kidnapped US Journalist James Foley RAW VIDEO Reaction\"", "title": "James Foley Death ISIS Beheads Kidnapped US Journalist James Foley RAW VIDEO Reaction", "publishedDate": "2014-08-20T01:40:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "29r9oqKlQ4U", "description": "A simple close-up video of a katydid that had flown into my house.
