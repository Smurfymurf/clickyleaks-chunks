Although we hate to admit it, kids can be mean. Your child may encounter bullying at some point during the school year. Kids can be impulsive in the things they do and say, as their ability to empathize with others isn't fully developed yet. Bullying, on the other hand, is different as it involves deliberate or repeated actions that hurts someone usually less powerful or weaker. This power difference means that bullying in schools needs to be stopped by an authoritative adult, like a teacher. Talk over options with your child's teacher about how to stop bullying and keep your child safe. Help them cope with more typical meanness by teaching her to avoid overreacting. Children who are picked on usually have big emotional reactions, like yelling or hitting, which could make them more of a target. Teach her to shrug her shoulders and walk away if she gets picked on. Practice assertive responses to stop bullying. If she's being teased, encourage her to respond with \"So what?\" to help her feel more confident at school. Cultivating existing friendships and starting new ones are more great ways to stop bullying. Children with one or two good friends are less likely to be bullied, so help your child find new friends in her class and set up play dates outside of school. Although you may not be able to shield your child from meanness forever, you can help her avoid school bullying by boosting her confidence in herself!\n\nWatch more Back-to-School videos: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiYyYW4hzpE&list=PL_XXfDtFe5UVP4IziM9heYLNcnFsou16T\n\nBully-Proof Your Child: How to Deal with Bullies: http://www.parents.com/kids/problems/bullying/bully-proof-your-child-how-to-deal-with-bullies/\n\nSubscribe to Parents: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=parents\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.parents.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/parentsmagazine\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/parentsmagazine\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/parentsmagazine/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/parentsmagazine#", "title": "Back to School: How to Deal with Bullying and Meanness", "publishedDate": "2013-07-18T14:00:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "9yiTEpxtmg8", "description": "I opened a play-doh marshal surprise, a minecraft mini-figure blind box, a one direction surprise egg, a play-doh chase surprise, the littlest pets collection blind bag, and some surprise eggs.\n\nfirst was a play-doh marshal surprise.

Art was a wonderful friend to me, and I will always treasure the memories of the times we spent knocking around Avalon, Carrollton, and the Mississippi Delta. I have yet to meet a more enthusiastic and passionate fan of Mississippi John Hurt than Art was, and few people know as much about Carroll County history as he did. As you can see in this, and the two other videos of him I have posted on this channel, Art had a real gift for John Hurt's style of playing and singing, and I regret that I didn't capture more performances by him. For many years Art was the unofficial tour guide for the Mississippi John Hurt Museum, and there's no telling how many John Hurt fans from all over the world he very graciously invited into his home and the countless hours he spent taking them around to the Museum, the Valley Store, and John Hurt's grave site. He will surely be missed, as there will never be another Art Browning, who basically dedicated the last portion of his life to preserving the legacy of John Hurt and his music. May his soul rest peacefully, and be assured that he will never be forgotten by all those whose lives were enriched by this humble and very generous man. - \"Lost Jim\" Ohlschmidt", "title": "Poor Boy Long Ways From Home - Art Browning plays Mississippi John Hurt", "publishedDate": "2010-04-13T13:32:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "9yjTcwHIfVM", "description": "Installation of intricate Victorian Corbel cornice projection of 300 mm on the ceiling.\nFor comments or questions message at \nhttp://www.hprs.net\nPlasterers Hawthorn, Plasterers Malvern, Plasterers Kew, Plasterers Camberwell, Plasterers Richmond, Plasterers  Toorak , Plasterers Prahran, Plasterers Box Hill , Plasterers Glen Iris, Plasterers Surrey Hills,  Plasterers Canterbury, Plasterers Hawthorn, Plasterers Prahran, Plasterers Richmond, Lath and Plaster, Plasterers Northcote, Plasterers Carlton, Plasterers Fitzroy, Plasterers Balwyn", "title": "Plastering Corbel Cornice installation ~ Hawthorn Plaster Repairs", "publishedDate": "2011-09-16T03:14:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "9yjkk3Wc4YI", "description": "Il faut combattre l'atroce supercherie de la vivisection!", "title": "Vivisection = pognon!", "publishedDate": "2013-08-11T12:53:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9yjxz7qmSqI", "description": "Carlos Il\u00f9, Pte de la C\u00e0mara de Productores de Cervantes se refiere a la entrega de los subsidios de la Provincia destinado a las tareas culturales.

He was an active and honest propagator of WAHDAT-E-UMMAT (Unity of Muslim Ummah) and for this cause he struggled in his life till the end. It is his one of the another contribution that he always preached the true essence of Islam, free from any type of negative constraints or influence E.g. schism, exhibition of knowledge, pride or for worldly gain etc. His knowledge was so vast and his memory was remarkable that he used to appreciate the contribution of Ulama (scholars) without any discrimination whether they are Brailvi, Deobandi or Ahle Hadees or whoever else. Maulana Ishaq is equally popular among the youth and the old ones. He is liked among Religious or Liberal class through his teachings/lectures to seek guidance from it. \n\n\nMaulana Mufti Ishaq rahmatullah ailah never associated him to any group (Maslak) instead he always called himself a Muslim and his all lectures are purely related to the original primitive teaching of Islam. He always addressed the issues of the questioners and provided them with best solution. This could only be possible if the Religion (ISLAM) is taken into his complete sense.\n\nHis efforts are appreciable and unforgettable. May Allah bless him with Jannat ul firdous .

This snake had lost her way into one of Thanda store rooms.

First I had to empty out the cabinet (hundreds of cans and bottles :-)) to be able to move it and to get to the snake hidden behind.\n\nOnce the cabinet was out of the way the Cobra did, what Cobras do. It opened it's hood and made hizzing sounds to scare me away. I used a \"snake grabbing stick\" to capture it (20 cm behind the head) and carried it out of the room holding it also by its tail.\n\nOnce safely lodged in a special snake barrel I drove the snake to one of Thanda's waterholes.

The average length of adults is between 90cm - 105cm (3-3\u00bd feet). This species prefers localities near water, to which it will readily take when disturbed. It is considered one of the most dangerous snakes in Africa. It can spit its venom. Its bite causes severe local tissue destruction. Venom to the eyes can also cause impaired vision or blindness. This cobra's diet mainly consists of amphibians, other snakes, birds, eggs, small mammals, and even insects occasionally. This snake is nervous and highly strung. When confronted at close quarters it can rear up to as much as two-thirds of its length, spread its long narrow hood and will readily \"spit\" in defense, usually from a reared-up position. By doing this the venom can be ejected at a distance of 2-3 meters (6\u00bd-10 feet), with remarkable accuracy. The spitting cobra does bite depending on its environment and the situation it is in, and also  feigns death to avoid further molestation.", "title": "Mozambique Spitting Cobra - Relocation", "publishedDate": "2014-01-06T20:23:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "9yqxDt4dAfc", "description": "This is the first morning that the new tank has been set up.

Su padre, due\u00f1o de un fundo, tocaba arpa y cantaba. As\u00ed que Montoya creci\u00f3 entre las cuerdas del arpa y las faenas del campo, montaba a caballo, orde\u00f1ando, elaborando queso o ayudando al padre en el conuco.

En actos p\u00fablicos y eventos siempre aparece con su inseparable sombrero y unas botas vaqueras puntiagudas.

Announced in mid-October, the phone has been built by Motorola, and is based on the existing, second generation Moto X smartphone. The main difference is, the Nexus 6 comes with the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop software installed.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t realized already just from the pictures, the Nexus is a monster. It has a 5.96-inch touchscreen with a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution, making it not only the largest Nexus smartphone, but also the model with the highest resolution display yet. It\u2019s powered by a quad-core Snapdragon 805 processor, has 3GB of RAM, and a choice of either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage space.\n\nA 13-megapixel camera with optical image stabilization sits on the back, and the lens is surrounded by a funky ring-style flash unit. On the front is a basic 2-megapixel selfie cam. A massive 3220mAh battery is inside the Nexus 6, and Motorola\u2019s special fast-charging tech means it\u2019ll provide six hours use on a 15-minute charge.\n\nThe big draw for many will be Android 5.0 Lollipop. The new OS brings with it a brand new look and design, which cuts down on clutter and goes for a more minimalist style. There are several new features, including an improved notification system, phone unlocking using Android Wear devices, a new set of pro photographic tools, and plenty more.\n\nIf the Nexus 6 sounds like the phone for you, you\u2019re going to have to splash out a little more than you may expect, because it\u2019s not the bargain previous Nexus phones have been. The 32GB Nexus 6 is $650, and the 64GB model is $700.\nNexus 6 units purchased through Google Play come without a network contract, but most major carriers will be stocking the phone soon, so just have patience if you\u2019d prefer to pay a subsidized price. You can pre-order the Nexus 6 now on the Google Play Store.\n\n\nRead more: http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-nexus-6-pre-order-news/", "title": "Hands on - Android Lollipop on a Nexus 6", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T22:00:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "9z0-h3r7W_4", "description": "Bienvenidos a mi taller de bisuter\u00eda,\nEn este video os ense\u00f1o como realizar el nudo plano o cuadrado de macrame sin armarnos un l\u00edo.

Males are bright red in color, with dark brown plumage, and females have a peach-colored belly with a dark grey top. The flycatchers grow to about seven inches in length, and feed mostly on insects such as flies, grasshoppers and beetles.\n\nThe Vermilion Flycatcher is a favorite among birders, but not generally kept by aviculturalists, as males tend to lose their bright colors when taken from the wild and kept in cages.\nDespite its brilliant color, the Vermilion Flycatcher is hard to detect in cottonwoods, willows, or mesquite, since it hunts from the highest canopy and generally remains well concealed. In sparsely vegetated areas, however, it may descend to the ground after insect prey. The male defends his territory with a prominent aerial display; he flies up singing, his red underparts and cap contrasting with the blue sky. When trying to attract a female he sings even at night.\n\ndescription 6&quot; (15 cm). Male has brilliant scarlet crown and underparts, with dark brown back, wings, and tail; female similar to male above but white below with dark streaks. Belly of females and immatures varies from pink to yellow to white.\n\nEsta bela ave \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m conhecida como ver\u00e3o, pois anuncia a chegada da esta\u00e7\u00e3o das cores, quando adquire esta linda cor escarlate, como atrativo para as f\u00eameas na \u00e9poca reprodutiva. Ap\u00f3s a reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, o macho muda para uma plumagem de descanso sexual, semelhante \u00e0 das f\u00eameas.\nAve migrat\u00f3ria, com reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o na Argentina, Paraguai e Uruguai, logo ap\u00f3s o t\u00e9rmino da segunda e \u00faltima procria\u00e7\u00e3o ( geralmente de novembro a fevereiro ), migram para o norte, sendo conhecida sua maci\u00e7a passagem pelo Pantanal. Passam de maio a agosto/setembro na regi\u00e3o amaz\u00f4nica, onde encontram-se com uma subesp\u00e9cie local.\n\nHelmut Sick, autor do livro \"Ornitologia Brasileira\", revela um caso muito interessante onde se manifestam fatores gen\u00e9ticos e ambientais como causadores da migra\u00e7\u00e3o. Na Argentina, foram observados pais e filhos separadamente. Logo ap\u00f3s os filhotes da segunda cria sa\u00edrem do ninho, em fins de janeiro, os adultos partem em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao norte, no auge do calor e com abund\u00e2ncia de alimento (insetos). Os filhotes, por\u00e9m, ficam na \u00e1rea e entram na muda. Finalmente, tr\u00eas meses ap\u00f3s o desaparecimento dos pais e demais adultos, quando o frio e a umidade outonais tornam-se fortes, os filhotes tamb\u00e9m emigram. Segundo Sick, portanto, os adultos do pr\u00edncipe obedecem a um ritmo end\u00f3geno, heredit\u00e1rio, enquanto os filhotes, possuindo a mesma estrutura gen\u00e9tica, s\u00e3o expulsos por press\u00f5es externas, do pr\u00f3prio ambiente. \n\nO macho, em plumagem de reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00e9 inconfund\u00edvel. O vermelho vivo da parte ventral contrasta com o dorso escuro (foto). Atr\u00e1s dos olhos, uma linha escura refor\u00e7a o contraste e torna-o \u00fanico. Na f\u00eamea, no macho juvenil e no macho adulto, entre mar\u00e7o e julho, a plumagem da regi\u00e3o ventral \u00e9 cinza clara com estrias mais escuras. Barriga com penas levemente r\u00f3seo alaranjado ou amareladas (juvenis) ou avermelhadas (foto). A linha escura atr\u00e1s dos olhos presente, com o dorso em tom escuro, embora menos contrastante do que na plumagem reprodutiva.\nA popula\u00e7\u00e3o pantaneira \u00e9 migrat\u00f3ria, chegando a partir de maio, vindo do sul do Brasil, Argentina, Uruguai e Paraguai. O nome comum de Bar\u00e3o do Melga\u00e7o indica a chegada pr\u00f3xima \u00e0 festa de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, no final de junho, quando \u00e9 mais notado. O nome ver\u00e3o \u00e9 dado no sul do Brasil, indicando a chegada, por l\u00e1, no per\u00edodo em que o tempo esquenta, ap\u00f3s o inverno.\nA maior parte das aves migra mais ao norte, at\u00e9 a Amaz\u00f4nia. Apesar da literatura considerar o Pantanal como \u00e1rea de nidifica\u00e7\u00e3o, na RPPN est\u00e3o de passagem ou durante o inverno austral. Os \u00faltimos s\u00e3o anotados em setembro. A maioria migra para o sul em agosto (logo depois dos machos adquirirem a plumagem vistosa), onde ir\u00e3o se reproduzir.\nAl\u00e9m das cores, destaca-se por seu h\u00e1bito de pousar em galhos expostos, cercas e fios. Dali, voa e captura insetos em v\u00f4o, retornando ao poleiro favorito. Ocupa os ambientes abertos, desde campos, praias de rio com arbustos at\u00e9 cerrado e bordas de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o florestal. N\u00e3o penetra em \u00e1reas com adensamento de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o.

He falsely accused her of almost hitting his wife with a microphone. \n\n\"I asked you a question: You want to apologize to her?\" he yelled. He then told a uniformed cop that he wanted to press charges against \"that blonde.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the actor walked up to Fox 5 reporter Robert Moses and warned him to leave the sidewalk in front of his building (CLICK FOR VIDEO). \n\nBaldwin later issued a statement on the website of MSNBC, the network that carries his weekly talk show, apologizing to his fans and colleagues. MSNBC pulled Baldwin's show, \"Up Late,\" from its schedule for two weeks.\n\n\"I did not intend to hurt or offend anyone with my choice of words, but clearly I have -- and for that I am deeply sorry,\" Baldwin said in the statement. \"Words are important. I understand that, and will choose mine with great care going forward. What I said and did this week, as I was trying to protect my family, was offensive and unacceptable. Behavior like this undermines hard-fought rights that I vigorously support.\"\n\nBaldwin was likely referring to the expletives he yelled at a photographer this week. He did not specifically reference the incidents with Fox 5's Moses and Schmidt.\n\nMoses and Schmidt have been covering the trial of Canadian actress Genevieve Sabourin, who was accused and then convicted this week of stalking Baldwin and his wife. Baldwin and the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said it was a case of an acquaintance with a movie star turning into harassment. Sabourin claimed it was a romance that fell apart.\n\nA judge sentenced Sabourin to 195 days in jail for stalking the Baldwins. That sentence came on top a 30-day contempt of court sentence he handed down Wednesday because she kept disrupting the court proceedings with outbursts.\n\nNYPD Arrested\n\n\n\nRead more: http://www.myfoxny.com/story/23982178/alec-baldwin-unloads-on-another-fox-5-reporter#ixzz2kmN731Hs \nFollow us: @myfoxny on Twitter | Fox5NY on Facebook", "title": "Alec Baldwin's Epic Meltdown: Screams At Fox News Reporter & Threatens To Press Charges", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T04:24:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "9z9RYMhfEnc", "description": "QR-Code 2-2:\nAm Beispiel der Reaktion von Phenol und Formaldehyd wird ein nicht nur fadenartiges, sondern ein dreidimensionales vernetztes Polymer, ein Phenol-Formaldehyd-Harz, dargestellt.", "title": "Polykondensation am Beispiel von Phenol und Formaldehyd", "publishedDate": "2014-05-15T05:50:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9z9qA-he-ok", "description": "Temple Adas Shalom Adult Choir, September 11th 2009.

Made by J &  E Stevens.  C. 1897.  This original bank is working with not breaks, cracks, or repair.  The iron bank is nickel plated.  Note some light wear on some edges and corners.  A coin is placed on the pig's plate.  When the lever in the back is pressed, the coin goes into the pig's mouth while the tongue moves upward.  Measures 5 3/4\" inches tall.\n\nI found the following article about this bank from the March 1970 issue of Hobbies Magazine written by F.H. Griffith:\n\n\n\n\"The Pig In High Chair was patented August 24, 1897, by Peter Adams of Buffalo, NY., assignor of one-half to Walter Shepard, also of Buffalo. This, of course, would normally have direct connections to the Shepard Hardware Company as being the manufacturer. However, the bank was actually made by the J. & E. Stevens Company of Cromwell, Conn., and pictured in various of their catalogs of the period. \n\nTo operate the bank a coin is placed on the tray and a lever in the back of the high chair is pressed down. This causes the tray to lift up and the coin slides therefrom on into the open mouth of the pig. As this action takes place the tongue of the pig also moves upward allowing the coin to drop inside.\n\nThe Pig In High Chair leaves some collectors rather 'cold.' They do not particularly like it, but must have one in their collection. Actually it's sort of a \"cute\" type bank, very well made, and somewhat attractive.\"", "title": "Antique J&E Stevens Mechanical Pig In High Chair Bank", "publishedDate": "2007-03-21T18:14:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "9zKh8zAy-Sc", "description": "", "title": "Qu\u1ea3ng c\u00e1o d\u1ea7u \u0103n cho b\u00e9 - Kiddy oil Vietnam", "publishedDate": "2013-07-11T14:24:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "9zL3BNEc-Ow", "description": "My new filming Turdus amaurochalinus bird (Turdidae) in Florian\u00f3polis Brasil - Canto do Sabi\u00e1-poca\n\nIt is one of the best known Brazilian thrushes,\n\nTurdidae species spread the seeds, contributing to the spread of many species and the recovery of ecosystems.

ONE iPAD EVERY 5 DAYS!!!\n\n\nReview:\n\nThe\u00a0iPad\u00a0is a\u00a0tablet computer designed, developed and marketed by\u00a0Apple primarily as a platform for audio-visual media including books, periodicals, movies, music, games, and web content. At about 1.5\u00a0pounds (680 grams), its size and weight fall between those of contemporary\u00a0smartphones and\u00a0laptop computers. Apple released the iPad in April 2010, and sold 3 million of the devices in 80 days.According to a report released by Strategy Analytics, the Apple iPad had gained a 95 percent share of Tablet PC sales at the end of the second quarter of 2010. During the second quarter of 2010, Apple sold 4.19 million iPads around the world.The iPad runs the same\u00a0operating system as the\u00a0iPod Touch and\u00a0iPhone\u2014and can run its own applications as well as iPhone applications. Without\u00a0modification, and with the exception of web applications, it will only run programs approved by Apple and distributed via its\u00a0online store.Like iPhone and iPod Touch, the iPad is controlled by a\u00a0multitouch display\u2014a departure from most previous tablet computers, which used a pressure-triggered\u00a0stylus\u2014as well as a virtual onscreen keyboard in lieu of a physical keyboard. The iPad uses a\u00a0Wi-Fi data connection to browse the Internet, load and stream media, and install software. Some models also have a\u00a03G wireless data connection which can connect to\u00a0HSPA data networks. The device is managed and\u00a0synced by\u00a0iTunes on a personal computer viaUSB cable.The iPad's\u00a0touchscreen display is a 9.7\u00a0in (25 cm)\u00a0liquid crystal display (1024 \u00d7 768 pixels) with\u00a0fingerprint-resistant and scratch-resistant glass. Steve Jobs backed the choice of screen size, saying a 7-inch screen would be \"too small to express the software.\"\u00a0He said 10\u00a0inches was the minimum for a tablet screen.\u00a0Like the iPhone, the iPad is designed to be controlled by bare fingers; normal gloves and\u00a0styli that prevent electrical conductivity may not be used,\u00a0although there are special gloves andcapacitive styli designed for this use.The display responds to two other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis\u00a0accelerometer to sense iPad orientation and switch between\u00a0portrait and landscape modes. Unlike the iPhone and iPod touch built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad built-in applications support\u00a0screen rotation in all four orientations (the three aforementioned ones along with upside-down),\u00a0meaning that the device has no intrinsic \"native\" orientation; only the relative position of the home button changes.In total there are four physical switches on the iPad, including a home button below the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides:\u00a0wake/sleep\u00a0and\u00a0volume up/down, plus a third which, as of iOS 4.2, acts as a mute switch. Initially this switch was utilized to lock out the screen rotation function (reportedly to prevent unintended rotation when the user is lying down).\u00a0However, with the iOS 4.2 update, this functionality was removed and rotation lock is now controlled with a software toggle via the iOS task switcher. There is no means to reassign the physical switches functionality in the official iOS release.The iPad can use Wi-Fi network\u00a0trilateration from\u00a0Skyhook Wireless to provide location information to applications such as\u00a0Google Maps. The3G model contains\u00a0A-GPS to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers; it also has a black plastic accent on the back side to improve 3G radio sensitivity.For wired connectivity, the iPad has a proprietary Apple\u00a0dock connector; it lacks the\u00a0Ethernet and USB ports of larger computers.", "title": "iPAD GIVEAWAY 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-03-15T00:44:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9zMSf73Fmu8", "description": "", "title": "shema blessings", "publishedDate": "2013-06-25T01:55:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "9zMYYcmhz_o", "description": "A punk band from Helsinki, Finland.

But a concept I'd like to explain to you are some of the toxins that are produced by Candida.  We call them toxic metabolites.  I'll talk more about different types in different videos.\n\nBut one type is called manon, and not many people have heard of manno.  But a 1991 study in a clinical journal showed that manno is, in fact, a glycol protein or a small protein which forms in cell walls of Candida.  And when yeast are killed by antibiotics, in particular, or killed in mass, the yeast cells bust up.  And these glycol proteins can basically accumulate in the digestive system in mass amounts and slowly drip free into the circulatory system.  And this can explain why people can get rid of the yeast infection, but for a long time after feel quite lousy and worked up about things.  These little protein molecules can float through the blood and trigger immune responses.  And it's also been reported they can travel up into the brain, through the blood-brain barrier in to many different spaces of body, which we didn't previously think that they could.  But there is certainly plenty of research now to validate this.\n\nThere's still quite a lot we don't know about these toxic metabolites, but manno is quite an insidious one.  And some people can have brain fart and feel spaced out from these tiny little proteins.  Other people can have sore joints.  There are many other manifestations, signs and symptoms produced by these toxic metabolites.\n\nThis is one reason I believe why there can be irritability after a yeast infection has been supposedly cleared up.  Some people suffer a lot from these particular toxins and other people not at all.  Irritability can also come about from not being diagnosed or having a prolonged yeast infection and basically you're brushed off by your doctor as being a hypochondriac.  I've heard this in many cases, too.  Wouldn't that make you irritable?  It sure would make me irritable if nobody believed me.\n\nThere are many reasons why irritability can be there with a yeast infection.  And I'll speak a lot further on other videos about these particular types of toxins and the protein derivatives which come about from yeast dying off.  \n\nSo I hope that answers your question to some degree.

The first step to addressing the gaps in care was to develop a consensus paper calling for a European gold standard in screening, treatment and monitoring across Europe. This paper, calling upon health professionals to establish guidelines in the optimal care of PKU, is currently being prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed publication.\n\nThis progress could not have been achieved without the strong collaboration of all our members. This year, we will be building on that momentum through the launch of a new working group dedicated to developing guidelines for the optimal treatment of PKU,\" said Eric Lange, President of E.S.PKU, and Chair of the Meeting.\n\n\"We need to ensure that PKU patients get an equal chance of living a healthy and productive life, no matter where they live. We cannot accept that some people with PKU are still being left untreated in Europe. The publication of the E.S.PKU consensus paper will contribute to addressing that,\" added Dr Francjan J van Spronsen, chair of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the E.S.PKU. \"The consensus paper asks us as professionals in PKU care to develop European or even world-wide guidelines on the treatment of PKU for every age throughout life.\"\n\nYou will get more information on the ESPKU consensus paper project as well as impressions from another outstanding ESPKU Annual Conference with this film.", "title": "ESPKU meeting 2012 - European Guidelines on treatment of PKU", "publishedDate": "2013-01-13T14:09:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "9zewDA1NkKU", "description": "Input and Output Devices use in computer-- Created using PowToon -- Free sign up at http://www.powtoon.com/ .

He has experience as a jingle writer and voice-over personality, and was a stand up comedian for many years, a skill set he still utilizes as emcee for the band.\n\nGuitarist and vocalist Ray Evangelista (Uncle Ray) has been featured on Minnesota Public Radio and in both the StarTribune and StPaul Pioneer Press. He toured for nearly a decade as a member of the USO Tour, and has played with The Platters, Prince, Little Anthony, The Imperials, Blood Sweat and Tears, Chaka Khan and many other A-list artists. Ray has had two Number One hits in the Philippines, one as a solo artist, and another as a member of New Nation. Ray was inducted into the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nLead vocalist Adrienne Marie grew up in a musical family and was singing on stage by age seven. Natural aptitude, perseverance and formal training led her to be nominated, while still in her teens, to represent the Midwest as a gospel soloist overseas in Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, and France. She worked with former Prince manager Gilbert Davison and has sung with Alex Ligerwood of Santana and Fergie Fredrickson of Toto. She connects with audiences on a personal level with her high energy stage persona.\n\nKeyboardist and vocalist Michael Julian Jakubiec (Dr. J.) started his musical career in Los Angeles where he performed, recorded and co-owned a night club.

A lot of cheap brands are now available and it is difficult to predict how good they are. Branemark is the original inventor of implants and these have been around for as long as tooth implants have been around.\nDental implant cost can vary from one make to another and their life spans vary too. A Branemark implant costs around US $3500 each. The teeth implants procedure can take anywhere between 2-6 months depending on the quality and density of the your jaw bone receiving the implant. Costs can vary from $1500 - $5000 depending on which area you reside in.\nOn the east or west coast the dental implant cost can range up to $5000 per tooth implants but areas that fall in midwest and the south the costs can vary from $700 to $1000 per implant. The only way you will know the cost is to call around. Don't go to just anyone and do not choose someone because they are \"cheap\". Remember you get what you pay for this is VERY true about tooth implants too.\nThe best value can be found at the dental colleges. Students may do it but only under the supervision of actual dentist/instructors. Mostly it the professors who do the job and demonstrate to their students. So, it may take more time as step-by-step instructions are given to the students. Waiting times are also more as there is a long waiting list for patients at dental schools.

James Rodr\u00edguez fue el encargado de poner los dos tanto del triunfo de la selecci\u00f3n de Colombia ante Uruguay, en choque por los octavos de final. Colombia y Brasil se ver\u00e1n las 'caras' en los cuartos de final.\n\nEn los primeros minutos del partido los uruguayos ten\u00edan cerrados los ataques de Colombia. Con doble marca por las bandas para cerrar a juan Cuadrado, Pablo Armero y Zu\u00f1iga. Los colombianos no podr\u00edan hacer da\u00f1o alguno al arco de Fernando Muslera.\n\nUruguay esperaba paciente e invitaba al ataque a los colombianos. El t\u00e9cnico Tab\u00e1rez hab\u00eda propuesto un partido a la contra. Pero un gol de otro partido arruinar\u00eda los planes 'charr\u00faas'.\n\nSobre los 27 minutos de juego James Rodr\u00edguez, con intensi\u00f3n de romper las l\u00edneas uruguayas, dispar\u00f3 un potente disparo al arco uruguayo, el bal\u00f3n se estrell\u00f3 sobre la parte baja del parante superior e ingres\u00f3 a gol. James Rodr\u00edguez marcaba uno de los mejores goles del Mundial.\n\nEl primer tiempo se iba con el 1-0 y los colombianos ten\u00edan la tranquilidad en el marcador. En los segundos 45' Uruguay sal\u00eda con todo con la intensi\u00f3n de tirar a su campo a los colombianos. Su intensi\u00f3n parec\u00eda tener resultado, pero una contra termin\u00f3 por acabar con las esperanzas orientales.\n\nTras una contra de Colombia, Juan Guillermo Cuadrado recibi\u00f3 el centro, dentro del \u00e1rea uruguaya, y la mand\u00f3 al coraz\u00f3n del \u00e1rea, en donde se encontraba James Rodr\u00edguez, para que este se encargara de poner el segundo y definitivo del partido.\n\nLa selecci\u00f3n de Colombia se prepara para enfrentar a Brasil en los cuartos de final. Mientras que Uruguaya alista sus maletas para regresar a su pa\u00eds.\n\nGol de James Rodr\u00edguez a los 27 minutos de juego. \nGol de James Rodr\u00edguez a los 49 minutos de juego.\n\nAlienaciones:\n\nColombia: Ospina, Yepes, Zapata, Armero, Aguilar, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, S\u00e1nchez, Cuadrado, Rodr\u00edguez, Guti\u00e9rrez y Mart\u00ednez.\n\nUruguay: Muslera, Pereira, C\u00e1ceres, God\u00edn, Pereira, Gim\u00e9nez, Rodr\u00edguez, Gonz\u00e1lez, Ar\u00e9valo, Forl\u00e1n y Cavani.", "title": "\"MEMES\" del Colombia (2) vs Uruguay (0).

El padre pronto abandon\u00f3 su familia y madre e hija se trasladaron a vivir a Langhirano, localidad pr\u00f3xima a Parma, lugar de origen de Giuseppina.\nA la edad de tres a\u00f1os se vio afectada por la poliomielitis de la que si bien se recuper\u00f3 considerablemente, le qued\u00f3 cierta dificultad para andar, lo que le impidi\u00f3 tomar parte en actividades f\u00edsicas, propias de su edad y por ello se interes\u00f3 en la m\u00fasica. Form\u00f3 parte del coro de la iglesia de Langhirano y a los trece a\u00f1os, su madre le hizo recibir clases de piano con la Signorina Pasani, en Parma. Renata trabaj\u00f3 con gran esfuerzo, practicando cuatro o cinco horas diarias, so\u00f1ando con una carrera como concertista, a la vez que cantaba cuanto llegaba a sus o\u00eddos, particularmente a trav\u00e9s de la radio. Por ello, su profesora de piano tom\u00f3 la iniciativa de ponerla en manos del profesor de canto Italo Brancucci, del conservatorio de Parma, donde pronto empez\u00f3 a recibir lecciones con Ettore Campogalliani, quien la mantuvo practicando escalas y entrenando su voz, antes de permitirle aprender sus primeras canciones, hacia el final del segundo a\u00f1o de su formaci\u00f3n como cantante.\nEl aut\u00e9ntico cambio en su carrera le lleg\u00f3 en 1946, cuando entre dudas y miedos, tuvo una audici\u00f3n en Mil\u00e1n, con Arturo Toscanini, reci\u00e9n llegado de Estados Unidos, en busca de j\u00f3venes nuevas voces. En el transcurso de la audici\u00f3n, le dijo que, para el concierto de reapertura de La Scala, tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, estaba buscando una \"voce d'angelo\", a lo que Tebaldi contest\u00f3: \"Cherchero' di fare del mio meglio, Maestro\". De esta an\u00e9cdota se deriv\u00f3 la creencia de que Toscanini la llam\u00f3 la de la \"voz de \u00e1ngel\", lo que Tebaldi neg\u00f3 en cuantas oportunidades tuvo. En ese concierto, cant\u00f3 La Oraci\u00f3n (\"Dal tuo stellato soglio\") de la \u00f3pera Mois\u00e9s en Egipto de Rossini y la parte de soprano del Te Deum de Verdi.\nPosteriormente, en el mismo a\u00f1o, cant\u00f3 los papeles de Margherita y Elena en Mefistofele y el de Elsa en Lohengrin de Wagner. El siguiente a\u00f1o cant\u00f3 La Boh\u00e8me y Eva en Los Maestros Cantores, de Wagner. Toscanini la anim\u00f3 para que cantara el papel de Aida y la invit\u00f3 para que lo ensayara en su estudio. Tebaldi estaba convencida que ese papel estaba reservado para una soprano dram\u00e1tica, pero fue persuadida por Toscanini y finalmente la cant\u00f3 en La Scala, en 1950, junto a Mario del Monaco y Fedora Barbieri, bajo la direcci\u00f3n de Antonino Votto. Su actuaci\u00f3n fue el mayor \u00e9xito de sus primeros a\u00f1os, lanz\u00e1ndola en su carrera.\nEntre otros teatros de Italia, cant\u00f3 en la \u00d3pera de Roma entre 1947 y 1962 y en la Comunale de Florencia, fue la estrella de la Scala de Mil\u00e1n, entre 1946 y 1955 con una reintr\u00e9e en la temporada 1959-60 y dos \u00faltimos recitales en 1974 y 1976. Fue la favorita del San Carlo de N\u00e1poles entre 1948 y 1962, donde volvi\u00f3 a actuar en 1967 con La Gioconda, de Amilcare Ponchielli.\nComenz\u00f3 con una gira, junto a la compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Scala, actuando en el Festival de Edimburgo y tras ello en Londres, donde debut\u00f3 en el Covent Garden, cantando el papel de Desd\u00e9mona en dos representaciones de Otello y una del R\u00e9quiem de Verdi, bajo la direcci\u00f3n de Victor de Sabata.\nTras ello, cant\u00f3 asiduamente en el Metropolitan de Nueva York y tambi\u00e9n en la \u00d3pera de San Francisco, en la de Chicago y en otros muchos teatros de Estados Unidos. Tambi\u00e9n en Alemania, Londres, Par\u00eds, Viena, Barcelona, Jap\u00f3n y Sudam\u00e9rica.\nSi bien se prodig\u00f3 en papeles melodram\u00e1ticos de la \u00f3pera verista, su repertorio fue muy amplio, incluyendo \u00f3peras de Wagner (si bien cantadas en italiano), en los papeles de Eva en Los Maestros Cantores, de Elsa en Lohengrin, y de Isabel en Tannh\u00e4user. El famoso director alem\u00e1n Karl B\u00f6hm le suplic\u00f3 que aprendiera alem\u00e1n para as\u00ed poder tomar parte en su repertorio. Tebaldi tambi\u00e9n cant\u00f3 La Pasi\u00f3n seg\u00fan San Mateo de Bach e incluso grab\u00f3 el papel de Cleopatra de la \u00f3pera Julio C\u00e9sar de H\u00e4ndel.\nSus compa\u00f1eros de escena fueron los m\u00e1s grandes cantantes de la \u00e9poca, entre otros: Carlo Bergonzi, Jussi Bjoerling, Franco Corelli, Mario del Monaco, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Giuseppe Di Stefano, Nicolai Gedda, Beniamino Gigli, Alfredo Kraus, Richard Tucker, Jon Vickers, Ram\u00f3n Vinay, Lauri Volpi y tantos otros.\nActu\u00f3 bajo la direcci\u00f3n de los m\u00e1s notables directores, tales como: Vladimir Ashkenazy, Leonard Bernstein, Karl B\u00f6hm, Richard Bonynge, Carlo Maria Giulini, Herbert von Karajan, Rudolf Kempe, James Levine, Zubin Mehta, Dmitri Mitropoulos, Francesco Molinari-Pradelli, Mario Rossi, Victor de Sabata, Sir Malcolm Sargent, Tullio Serafin, Sir Georg Solti y Arturo Toscanini.", "title": "Renata Tebaldi.

It is not native to Great Britain, but was first introduced in 1842,[2] by Thomas Powys and is now naturalised there. It was also successfully introduced to the South Island of New Zealand in the early 20th century.\nThis species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as typical owls, Strigidae, which contains most species of owl. The other grouping is the barn owls, Tytonidae.\nThe Little Owl is a small owl, usually 22 centimetres (8.7 in) tall with a wingspan of 56 centimetres (22 in) for all genders, and weighs about 180 grams (6.3 oz).[3]\n\nThe adult Little Owl of the most widespread form, the nominate A. n. noctua, is white-speckled brown above, and brown-streaked white below. It has a large head, long legs, and yellow eyes, and its white \"eyebrows\" give it a stern expression. This species has a bounding flight like a woodpecker. Juveniles are duller, and lack the adult's white crown spots. The call is a querulous kee-ik.\n\nThere is a pale grey-brown Middle Eastern type known as Syrian Little Owl A. n. lilith. Other forms include another pale race, the north African A. n. desertae, and three intermediate subspecies, A. n. indigena of southeast Europe and Asia Minor, A. n. glaux in north Africa and southwest Asia, and A. n. bactriana of central Asia. A recent paper in the ornithological journal Dutch Birding (vol. 31: 35-37, 2009) has advocated splitting the southeastern races as a separate species Lilith's Owl Athene glaux (with subspecies A. g. glaux, A. g. indigena, and A. g. lilith).\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Owl\nThe Little Owl has an average life expectancy of three years\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Owl", "title": "Little Owl Sounds and Pictures", "publishedDate": "2013-11-11T19:23:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "A-XpduT3-yc", "description": "", "title": "panam   me pica", "publishedDate": "2012-08-20T23:57:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "A-XplYOrDvM", "description": "http://www.youtube.com/EnglishVN\n------------------------ \nLanguage Studies International English TOEFL / TOEIC / IELTS Preparation Courses at Cambridge, England, USA, AUS...", "title": "How to Pronounce Flaxseed", "publishedDate": "2013-09-07T20:04:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "A-YAPIcWtkQ", "description": "hand function of a hemiplegic patient with spastic hand. comparison with and without FES plus SHS.\nhand function improves over a period of time. when patient practices grasp and release with SHS and FES.\nIt helps to reduce spasticity, improves hand movement, improves voluntary control and activity of daily living.", "title": "SHS (Spastic Hand Splint) for spastic hemiplegic hand at Hope Neuro care hospital, Ahmedabad", "publishedDate": "2013-10-14T11:32:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "A-YLCsgRtjs", "description": "", "title": "biggest mushroom in the philippines", "publishedDate": "2013-05-31T11:49:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "A-Ymbvx9aa0", "description": "Sorry about the dark video, it was right before dark before this fatty smashed the fatback.

Caiman lizards are found in South America in Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Brazil. These lizards spend a lot of time in the water and they inhabit marshes, streams and flooded forests. Caiman lizards often bask on branches overhanging the water.\n\nThe Caiman Lizard is built similarly to its cousin the tegu, with a large heavy set body and short but powerful limbs. Its head is bulky and often a red or orange color. Their jaws are heavily muscular to help aid in eating its normal prey of snails, crawfish and fresh water clams. It also has a few adaptations that help it in its watery habitat. It has a long, laterally flattened tail, similar to its name sake, the Yacare Caiman. The long tail helps the Caiman Lizard to successfully swim and dive. It also has a clear third eyelid which is thought to act like a pair of goggles underwater. The coloration of the Northern caiman lizard (Dracaena guianensis) is very similar to that of a crocodile. It is typically a bright green with slight dark green banding. The Paraguayan caiman lizards (Dracaena paraguayensis) are typically much more drab, with gray bodies and heads. There are tough raised scutes along the dorsal portion of the back. These give the caiman lizard a crocodilian appearance, and help to provide some protection against predators. These lizards can become up to 4 feet long and weigh up to 10 lbs.\n\nCaiman Lizards are bred at the Madras Crocodile Bank in Tamil Nadu, India. They are kept in private collections, but they are not yet kept in large numbers due to their tendency to only accept snails, and their high price. Additionally, caiman lizards are arboreal, aquatic, and burrowing, so suitable enclosures are usually only made by zoos. Caiman lizards born in captivity have been known to take a variety of food items, including snails, fish, cat food, and crustaceans. Their temperament is comparable to that of a tegu, but keepers have reported that caiman lizards are much easier to clicker train, and therefore are possibly more intelligent.", "title": "Big Caiman Lizard - Water Tegu - Dracaena - Teiid Family - Reptiles - Lizards - Reptile", "publishedDate": "2013-06-30T23:02:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "A-_NJQuO9M4", "description": "We went behind the scenes on the set of Murdoch Mysteries as its star, Yannick Bisson, took a turn in the director's chair for a very special episode.\n\nMurdoch Mysteries on CBC: http://www.cbc.ca/murdochmysteries/\nMurdoch Mysteries on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MurdochOnCBC\nMurdoch Mysteries on Twitter: https://twitter.com/CBCMurdoch\nMurdoch Mysteries on Instagram: http://instagram.com/cbcmurdoch", "title": "Yannick Bisson Directs Murdoch Mysteries", "publishedDate": "2013-02-13T14:59:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "A-_QTgKwHEw", "description": "Foodborne botulism is a severe type of food poisoning caused by the ingestion of foods containing the potent neurotoxin formed during the growth of the organism.

My answer is how old is too old?\" the veteran, Denee Mallon, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, said in an email interview before the board issued its decision.  \"When people ask if I am too old, it feels like they are implying that it's a `waste of money' to operate at my age. But I could have an active life ahead of me for another 20 years. And I want to spend those years in congruence and not distress.\" \n\nJennifer Levi, a lawyer who directs the Transgender Rights Project of Gay & Lesbian Advocates and Defenders in Boston, said the ruling does not mean Medicare recipients are necessarily entitled to have sex reassignment surgery paid for by the government. \n\nInstead, the lifting of the coverage ban means they now will be able to seek authorization by submitting documentation from a doctor and mental health professionals stating that surgery is medically indicated in their individual case, Levi said. \n\n\"They should either get coverage or, at a minimum, receive an individualized review of the medical need for the specific procedure they seek, just like anyone seeking coverage for any other medical treatment,\" Levi's organization said in a statement after the ruling was issued. \n\nTransgender health advocates said that because private insurance companies and state-run Medicaid programs that provide health insurance for low-income individuals often take their cue from the federal government on which treatments to approve or exclude, the decision could eventually pave the way for sex-reassignment surgeries to be a routinely covered benefit. \n\nNo statistics exist on how many people might be affected by the decision. Gary Gates, a demographer with The Williams Institute, a think tank on LGBT issues based at the University of California, Los Angeles, has estimated that people who self-identify as transgender make up 0.3 percent of the U.S. adult population.

At http://DoctorsExpressStamford.com we will explore the world of hernias! \n\nWhat are hernias? \nThe hernias referred to in this Medical Minute are groin, or inguinal hernias,. More commonly found in men, An inguinal hernia occurs when part of the small intestine protrudes through a tear or weakness in your groin (the area between your abdomen and your thigh). Anybody can get an inguinal hernia, but it is more common among males.\n\nHernias form as a bulge accompanied by pain, in their groin. Men have an approximate 27% lifetime risk of having hernia at some point in their life, where as women have a much lower incidence- only 3% of women will experience a hernia at some point in their life. Other types of hernias, such as abdominal hiatal hernias are also common, but groin hernias tend to outnumber abdominal hernias by about 3 to 1. \n\nWhat causes a hernia?\nInguinal hernia can be diagnosed by physical exam. Their cause is not always known, but hernias could be the result of weak spots in the abdominal wall. Weaknesses can be due to congenital defects (present at birth) or formed later in life. Some risk factors for inguinal hernia include:\n\u2022 fluid or pressure in the abdomen\n\u2022 heavy lifting\n\u2022 straining during urination or bowel movements\n\u2022 obesity\n\u2022 chronic cough\n\u2022 pregnancy\n\nHernias often form in people with weakened abdominal muscles or in those who do a lot of heavy lifting or straining, which is why we see it quite often in young men.  Without getting into too much physiology, men have testicles and scrotum, and those structures descend through the inguinal canal. This canal is much larger in men than in women and that's part of the reason men tend to be more susceptible to hernias than women.\n\nSymptoms of hernia\n\nSymptoms of inguinal hernia include a bulge in the groin area and pain, pressure, or aching at the bulge\u2014especially when lifting, bending, or coughing. These symptoms usually subside during rest periods. Men may also have swelling around the testicles.\n\n\nScreening and Diagnosis of Hernias\nIf you are having abdominal pain or pelvic bulge and pain, you want to see physician, and he or she will do an exam. They will use their finger, and they will see if you have a bulge in your scrotum or on your groin and they'll see if its reducible or not. If the exam doesn't give them the answer, they can perform an ultrasound, a very, inexpensive test that can tell you the same day whether a hernia is present. \n\n\nWhat to do if you think you have a hernia\nMost of the time hernias don't cause problems. People can have them their entire life.  When they do cause pain though that's a problem, and a concern that complications may have arisen. Most common hernias are what we call reducible; you can take your finger or you can lie down in bed and due to the effects of gravity, the bulge in the groin will actually disappear, which means the intestinal contents actually go back into the abdominal cavity or to the correct location. If it's not reducible by lying down or using a finger or having a physician trying to reduce it, then there are concerns about things like strangulation, or incarceration occurring.  Without getting into details of what those are, if those concerns are there, then you need to see a surgeon, and there may be a need for surgery.\n\nTreating a Hernia\nAs I stated before, hernias are actually something that you can watch for years without being treated. If however, it is causing pain, we generally refer folks to a surgeon who can do a very simple laparoscopic surgery.  \n\nIf you suspect a hernia, but have not been diagnosed, you should see your doctor, and of course, we are happy to see you here at Doctors Express", "title": "What is A Hernia", "publishedDate": "2014-06-25T14:16:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "A05Brj0xDdg", "description": "\"Red Peppers (Two Step)\" by Imogene Giles from Quincy, ILLINOIS (1907)", "title": "Red Peppers by Imogene Giles (1907, Ragtime piano)", "publishedDate": "2013-11-17T18:38:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "A05f8YdLx7U", "description": "I always had problems getting my glasses clean before I tried this.

In general, water cannot be owned, channeled or damned for the benefit of one owner at the detriment of other owners. The correlative rights doctrine says that a land owner has the right to take a reasonable share of underground waters which does not infringe on adjoining owner's rights. Riparian rights have to do with property adjoining moving water like a river or stream. Littoral rights have to do with land on a standing body of water like a lake, pond, ocean or bay. Littoral rights specify land ownership on a body of water like a lake or pond to be the average low water mark and for the ocean, the high tide water mark.

During the decade preceding the transmutation of the word \"jazz\" from a verb into a noun, a vibrant mosaic of musical ideas and styles made it possible for this new form to germinate, develop, and spread throughout the world, a process accelerated by the increasing availability of phonograph records. Little attention has been paid to certain unsung innovators who participated in this fascinating fomentation, as jazz is thought to have first appeared on records in 1917, bursting suddenly on to the scene like Athena springing fully armed from an aneurysm in the brain of Zeus. Music existing chronologically and stylistically between the categories of ragtime and jazz tends to fall through the cracks, in retrospect. Perhaps the time has come for the world to recognize Harry A. Yerkes, an individual who was receptive to the new music and provided fertile ground for its development, as he led numerous ensembles whose recordings appeared on many of the popular labels between 1917 and 1924. \n\nYerkes was among the very first Columbia recording artists; his two 1905 xylophone solos were subsequently released on Columbia two-minute wax cylinders. He also performed as a bell ringer, but greater opportunities were in store for him. By September of 1917, Yerkes had secured a position at Columbia as leader of his own ensembles, and producer for many others. Yerkes was, in fact, responsible for setting up Ted Lewis with a steady contract at Columbia. The names of Yerkes' many recording bands are delightfully strange. A very abbreviated list includes Yerkes Marimbaphone Band, Yerkes Jazarimba Orchestra (spelled most often with only one \"z\" but occasionally with two), Yerkes S.S. Flotilla Orchestra, Yerkes Bellhops, the Novelty Five, and, most famously among early jazz enthusiasts, the Happy Six. The music played by these groups ranged from classical overtures and light-headed mood pieces through topical favorites (plenty of thematic material during the First World War), to something definitely informed by ragtime and pointing the way towards authentic jazz.\n\nFor more information please see:\nhttp://www.answers.com/topic/harry-a-yerkes", "title": "Goodbye Shanghai - Yerkes S.S.

Day 21 after you have transplanted your plants. It is now time for your plants to switch into the Vegetative Cycle. The Vegetative Cycle will last from day 21 after transplant until day 45. During the Vegetative Cycle, your plants will begin to stretch out and fill in their available space. However, there are a few changes we need to make as we now enter this cycle. These mainly include the light cycle and the watering.\n\nTo make the switch to the Vegetative Cycle, do the following:\n\n\u2022 The first thing you want to change is the light cycle. Up to now, your Phototron's\u2122 lights have been on for 24 hours a day. To enter the Vegetative Cycle, you will now need to set your Phototron\u2122 to stay ON for only 16 hours and OFF for 8 hours. This light change tells the plant that it is now time to go into serious growth mode. To accomplish this light change automatically, we highly recommend that you purchase a 24 hour programmable timer.\n(PLEASE NOTE: These timers are available in our ACCESSORY CATALOG.)\n  \n\u2022 The second thing you will be changing is the water. Now that you have entered into the Vegetative Cycle, it is now\ntime up the nutrient level and switch to the 1/16 FEED to water your plants. \n\n\u2022 The third thing you will be changing is the amount of water added to your plants. From day 21 to day 30 after transplant, you will be watering your plants with ONE AND A HALF QUARTS of the 1/16 FEED. And on day 31 to 45, you will be watering your plants with TWO QUARTS of the 1/16 FEED.", "title": "Using your Phototron Step 10: Switching to the Vegetative Cycle", "publishedDate": "2011-02-16T16:29:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "A0YHPH_IN34", "description": "WEDNESDAYS Rockbar NYC (185 Christopher Street) 10pm\nSick and tired of talent competitions that don't celebrate and honor fabulous fierceness, gayness and faggotry?

They were fully owned and operated by Television New Zealand, a service of the now-defunct Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand.\n\nTV ONE, originating programmes from Wellington, opened at 8am on weekends and 11.30am on weekdays. TV2, from Auckland, kicked off at midday on weekends and 2.30pm on weekdays, and both channels ceased transmission before midnight with a classic animated cartoon, featuring the Goodnight Kiwi and the Cat. \n\nFive days were commercial and Sundays were non-commercial on both channels. Fridays were non-commercial on TV ONE and Saturdays non-commercial on TV2. By the mid-80s, advertising revenue was increased and commercials were moved from five to six days a week (except Sundays).\n\nFeatured in this video are clips from \"Network New Zealand\", a feature-length documentary from independent producer Ian Mackersey, chronicling a day in the life of the state broadcaster. Coverage was split between the often extreme lengths (and heights) gone to by technicians maintaining coverage, and the work of iconic TVNZ programmes, including the 6.30 News, McPhail and Gadsby, Country GP, Woolly Valley and many more. \n\nThe documentary was filmed in 1984 and broadcast in 1985 as part of the 25th anniversary celebrations at TVNZ.\n\nBackground music: an extended version of the Goodnight Kiwi theme, \"Hine e Hine\", with sound effects in the closing credits from \"Network New Zealand\".\n\nProgramme content (c) Ian Mackersey Productions/TVNZ 1985", "title": "New Zealand Television in the 1980s - The Best of Times", "publishedDate": "2013-01-22T22:14:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "A0dgUitzwgs", "description": "Fermentation simply simulates the typical environmental conditions that cells inhabit in order to grow them up.

Its surface cleans up easily and it is so durable that a cook can cut directly in the cookware even with an electric knife without fear of scratching, chipping or cracking the surface.

Can anyone help us identify this species?\n\nSingle Dahlias growing at a garden in Landour, Uttarakhand, India.\n\nDahlia is a genus of bushy, tuberous, herbaceous perennial plants native mainly in Mexico, but also Central America, and Colombia. A member of the Asteraceae (or Compositae), dicotyledonous plants, related species include the sunflower, daisy, chrysanthemum and zinnia. There are 42 species of dahlia, with hybrids commonly grown as garden plants. Flower forms are variable, with one head per stem; these can be as small as 2 in (5.1 cm) diameter or up to 1 ft (30 cm) (\"dinner plate\"). This great variety results from dahlias being octoploids\u2014that is, they have eight sets of homologous chromosomes, whereas most plants have only two. In addition, dahlias also contain many transposons\u2014genetic pieces that move from place to place upon an allele\u2014which contributes to their manifesting such great diversity.\n\nThe stems are leafy, ranging in height from as low as 12 in (30 cm) to more than 6\u20138 ft (1.8\u20132.4 m). The majority of species do not produce scented flowers or cultivars. Like most plants that do not attract pollinating insects through scent, they are brightly colored, displaying most hues, with the exception of blue.\n\nThe dahlia was declared the national flower of Mexico in 1963. The tubers were grown as a food crop by the Aztecs, but this use largely died out after the Spanish Conquest. Attempts to introduce the tubers as a food crop in Europe were unsuccessful. \n\nLandour, a small cantonment town contiguous with Mussoorie, is about 35 km (22 mi) from the city of Dehradun in the northern state of Uttarakhand in India. The twin towns of Mussoorie and Landour, together, are a well-known British Raj-era hill station in northern India. Mussoorie-Landour was widely known as the \"Queen of the Hills\". The name Landour is drawn from Llanddowror, a village in Carmarthenshire in southwest Wales. During the Raj, it was common to give nostalgic English, Scottish, Welsh or Irish names to one's home (or even to British-founded towns), reflecting one's ethnicity. Names drawn from literary works were also common, as from those by Robert Burns, Walter Scott, Thomas Hardy, Robert Louis Stevenson and many others.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Adult males can approach this legspan, but are a much lighter build.  Some adult males are considerably smaller than females, around 1/8 their weight.  In salubrious conditoins in captivity males can mature in under 2 years (and die well under 3 years) and females can mature in under 3 years and live to around 10 years. In nature all these times are probably doubled (with long lifespans to lucky females).\n\nAdult females and near adults of both sexes are typically very quick to present a threat display. They will bite a careless owner, but one (nice) functional difference between these spiders and tarantulas is that these spiders do not have enough sticky pads on their feet to climb vertical smooth surfaces, like glass.  This makes managing sometimes crabby spiders much easier!\n\nThe coloration of these spiders is particularly interesting.  In most light conditions they are essentially brown, with only hints of their metallic colors.  In the right kinds of bright light, like a camera flash and some natural and room lighting they show off much more dramatic effects.  They become silver with baby blue highlights and rainbow iridescense.  The babies start out a sort of translucent white color and do not gain this adult coloration until they are around half grown.  Even then, the enhanced coloration is most apparent in adults.  Mature females and males display full enhancement, contrary to a lot of other \"fancy\" mygalomorph/tarantula species.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\nthe male in this video was provided by www.kenthebugguy.com", "title": "My Silver Spiders - Calisoga longitarsus", "publishedDate": "2011-03-27T20:12:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "A0nkoXSChNk", "description": "", "title": "ARMOR BEARERS VIDEO", "publishedDate": "2013-05-12T04:44:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "A0nmt-pRBQs", "description": "Track demo of loco for sale.

O b\u00f3lido \u00e9 um fragmento de mat\u00e9ria s\u00f3lida que ao penetrar na atmosfera terrestre provoca um brilho intenso seguido por um estrondo.

Por isso, todos os anos no m\u00eas de outubro, quando a Terra em seu movimento de transla\u00e7\u00e3o passa pr\u00f3ximo ao Sol, acontece a chuva de meteoros.\n\nEste ano, a chuva de meteoros vai acontecer perto do equador celeste, isso significa que ser\u00e1 igualmente vis\u00edvel em ambos os hemisf\u00e9rios norte e sul, entre os dias 15 e 29 de outubro, podendo ser visto com um pouco mais de facilidade da noite do dia 20 at\u00e9 a madrugada do dia 21 deste m\u00eas.

A lot more people will be writing about it on the internet so I wanted to jump in and give you a brief synapses' of what it's all about.\n\nIntermittent fasting is nothing new. It's been widely used for a long time now, but it just hasn't been that popular. It's been more of an underground thing as far as being mainstream is concerned.\n\nThere is currently only 1 product out on the internet that goes over intermittent fasting and how you can use it to lose pounds of body fat and or build pounds of muscle. It's called Eat Stop Eat and it's by Brad Pilon.\n\nAnother great resource is the website Lean Gains by Martin Berkham. He is a huge proponent of intermittent fasting and you can find out a lot about the topic from him. In fact, I learned a lot from him regarding this topic and how to use it on myself.\n\nAnyways, intermittent fasting has to do with you fasting for a period of 14-16 hours before you have your first days meal. For women, Martin suggests they fast for 14 hours before having their first meal of the day and for men around 16 hours is just fine. You are to consume no food during this period. The only thing you are allowed to consume is coffee, water and diet soda drinks if you want. But I wouldn't suggest that. Just stick to coffee and water.\n\nOnce the fasting period is over, for 8 hours, you are allowed to have around 3 meals. You will consume all of your day's calories within this 8 hour window.\n\n\n\nThe first meal of the day should be your largest with it representing around 70-80% of your days total calories. This meal is supposed to be ingested after your workout which also should be performed in a semi fasted state. In fact, you should consume around 10 grams of BCAA's before your workout to kick start the anabolic process. I personally consume a half of scoop or full scoop of casein hydrosolate before I workout in the fasted state. It's chock full of BCAA's, fast digesting protein and I added extra leucine  to the mixture.\n\nAnyways, the type and amount of calories you are supposed to consume during your 8 hour period of feeding is dependent on your goals. If your goal is to build strictly lean muscle mass with minimal fat gain, then consume around 80% of your calories right after your workout. Also consume plenty of starchy carbohydrates during this along with lean protein. Try to keep the fat content minimal for the first meal.\n\nYou want to consume this large meal full of starchy carbs and clean protein with a ton of calories because your body is extremely insulin sensitive during this time from your workout and from your 14-16 fast.\n\nFor your next 2 meals, gradually lower the carbohydrate content and amount of calories. The 2nd meal will be higher in calories then the last meal.\n\nTo keep body fat to a minimum, on days you don't work out, I would advise you to perform some sort of very low intensity cardiovascular exercise around 60% of your max heart rate in the fasted state. For your first meal of the day, swap out those starchy carbs with more vegetables and more fat. The days you don't work out, there is no need to have so many carbs in your diet since you won't need them.\n\nIf you're trying to drop body fat, then for your first meal of the day, have a smaller amount of carbohydrates, more vegetables and more protein to keep you satiated. For the last 2 meals, have more healthy fats, protein and a ton of veggies.\n\nIt's pretty simple when you look at it all.\n\nSo far I've been following this diet and haven't had any problems at all. I have zero cravings for junk food because I'm so full at night, I feel satiated and I'm not starving while I workout.\n\nHunger is a learned response. Your body will signal a hunger response if it's used to eating at that time of the day. That's why I'm starting to get away from eating 5-6 meals  a day. The constant up and down of my blood sugar and hunger is annoying and troublesome. At night I was always craving food because I felt like I had to eat.\n\nBut now, I can stuff myself at night without worry.\n\nAnd don't worry about that stupid rule that you're not supposed to eat after a certain time of the day. That's false. Remember, everything is relative. You're not going to get fat from eating a majority of your calories during the last half of the day as long as you go through with your 14-16 hour fast.\n\nThe body is extremely adept and can change it's rhythms without a problem.\n\nI suggest you try intermittent fasting. It's a great way to lose weight, build muscle or just even maintain your current physique without having to worry about food, cooking all these meals, and having to deal with cravings.", "title": "Intermittent Fasting - Is Intermittent Fasting Good For Fat Loss", "publishedDate": "2011-08-11T17:29:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "A0x4PJzXMd4", "description": "Ellen has found another group of text message mistakes that are so funny it hurts.

Other instruments commonly played in choro are the mandolin, clarinet, saxophone, trumpet and trombone. These melody instruments are backed by a rhythm section composed of guitar, 7-string guitar (playing bass lines) and light percussion, such as a pandeiro. The cavaquinho appears sometimes as a melody instrument, other times as part of the rhythm.\n\n\n[edit] Compositional structure\nStructurally, a choro composition usually has three parts, played in a rondo form: AABBACCA, with each section typically in a different key. There are a variety of choros in both major and minor keys.\n\n\n[edit] History\nMuch of the success of this style of music came from the early days of radio, when bands performed live on the air. By the 1960s it had evolved into urban samba. However, in the late 1970s there was a successful effort to revitalize the genre, through TV-sponsored nation-wide festivals in 1977 and 1978, which attracted a new, younger generation of musicians. Thanks in great part to these efforts, choro music remains strong in Brazil. More recently, choro has attracted the attention of musicians in the United States, such as Mike Marshall and Maurita Murphy Mead, who have brought this kind of music to a new audience. Most Brazilian classical composers recognize the sophistication of choro and its major importance in Brazilian instrumental music. Radam\u00e9s Gnattali said it was the most sophisticated instrumental popular music in the world. Heitor Villa-Lobos defined choro as the true incarnation of Brazilian soul. Notably, both composers had some of their music inspired by choro, bringing it to the classical tradition.[1]\n\nAccording to Aquiles Rique Reis (a Brazilian singer), Choro is classical music played with bare feet and callus on the hands[2]\n\n\n[edit] Notable Brazilian choro musicians\nAbel Ferreira \nAltamiro Carrilho \nBenedito Lacerda \nChiquinha Gonzaga \nCh\u00f4ro das 3 \nDino 7 Cordas \nErnesto Nazareth \nGaroto \nHamilton de Holanda \nHenrique Cazes \nIrineu de Almeida \nIsrael Bueno de Almeida \nIzaias Bueno de Almeida \nJacob do Bandolim \nJo\u00e3o Pernambuco [1] \nLuiz Otavio Braga \nLuizinho 7 Cordas \nMaur\u00edcio Carrilho \nMilton M\u00f3ri \nNaylor 'Proveta' Azevedo \nOscar Castro Neves \nPaulo Bellinati \nPaulo Moura \nPaulo S\u00e9rgio dos Santos \nPixinguinha \nRaphael Rabello \nWaldir Azevedo \nYamand\u00fa Costa \nZ\u00e9 Barbeiro \nZ\u00e9 da Velha", "title": "2009 chorinho celso machado", "publishedDate": "2009-04-29T15:34:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1-EXyLPK0E", "description": "", "title": "Bison Herd - Ft.

They're not only used for automotive painting but for any work relating to refinishing.\n\nBecause we concentrate on auto body work here we will elaborate on autos.\n\nBefore tacking your car down just be sure that you already wiped it down with wax and grease remover\n\nWARNINGS & PRECAUTIONS\n\nNever wax and grease over painted base coat.\n\nWax and grease remover is only used over your prepped panels that you plan to paint. Over a sanded car and primer is ok.\n\nNever over and between base coat or single stage paints.\n\nBase Coat Clear Coat Tacking\n\nWhen painting base coat clear coat you only want to tack your vehicle before you start painting and in between base coats only. Be sure to flash your base. Make sure your base is DRY before  you tack.\n\nDo not press too hard.\n\nOpen your tack rag entirely, then fold it up into a cloth a little bigger than your hand.\n\nStart from the roof of the car and work your way down. Be sure to open up your rag and use a new clean area as your rag gets colored with overspray.

The most important thing when you're doing any step in a club is staying on the beat. Once we get this groove we can add any step in we want. \n\nFor our purposes today we're going to start with a simple step touch. I'm going to use the groove that goes back. So, when I say the groove that goes back I mean if the beat is going boom, two, three, four each time that bass hits I'm leaning back on the beat. It's also important to note that it's not just my torso going back, but it's also my chin and my head pulling back this way. And my knees are bouncing so that I'm going lower as I bounce back. \n\nLet's take that simple groove and put it with a step touch. So, we have our groove here, two, three, four. We're just going step, touch, step, touch, step, touch, step, touch. \n\nThe key to making these simple moves look good is being relaxed and being confident. You can do anything with your arms as long as they follow the same rhythm that your feet are doing. What I mean by that is if you're body's going back in a rock you want your arms to groove on that same beat. They can swing front to back, they can open and close, they can push down, they can go up, but you don't want to have them spazzing out in different directions. You want to keep them smooth. If the beat speeds up your arms can speed up. \n\nLastly, with your feet we aren't limited to just the step touch. We can step over and over with the same foot, for instance turning ourself around in a circle. We can add a slide. Step, touch, slide. We can bounce on the beat and go back to our basic groove. \n\nIf you take these three things, your step touch, your bounce, and your slides you can have limitless combinations that you can use out at the club. Just remember to smile, have a good time, don't be shy, and keep that groove on beat no matter what.", "title": "How to Dance at a Club | Hip-Hop How-to", "publishedDate": "2012-02-09T17:07:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1Bzqnv7tYc", "description": "Live @Soundfix Records (8.26.07, Brooklyn, NY)", "title": "Luke Pritchard (The Kooks) - Seaside/See The World", "publishedDate": "2007-10-16T07:13:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1CAGHpGjsQ", "description": "Act-On partnered with Glide SF for the Dreamforce 2014 Tchotchke Challenge.

According to Sergei Druzin, head of research and development at Almaz-Antey, the enhanced version represents a \u201cunique air defense system in its class with an astounding precision and range.\u201d\n\nThe Tor system is a low- to medium-altitude, short-range surface-to-air missile system designed for intercepting aircraft, cruise missiles, precision-guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles and ballistic targets.\n\nTor-M1K and Tor-M2U variants, armed with 9M331 missiles, are currently in service with the Russian army. The new system, equipped with new 9M338 missiles, was successfully tested at the end of October 2013. \u201cWe carried out five launches targeting highly maneuverable drones. Three of the targets were hit head-on, while the other two were destroyed by shrapnel from exploding warheads. It is an excellent result, astounding precision,\u201d Druzin said.\n\nIn addition, the smaller size of the 9M338 compared with its predecessor has allowed the carrying capacity of the launcher to be doubled, from eight to 16 missiles. The official said the improved Tor-M2 systems and 9M338 missiles have been approved by a state commission for mass production. \u201cWe can now start producing these missiles in quantities that would meet the demand of the Russian army,\u201d Druzin said. The Tor M2E missile system has also been exported to Azerbaijan, Belarus, Ukraine, China, Venezuela and Iran. Earlier versions (M1) were also exported to Greece, Cyprus and Egypt.\n\nAccording to Druzin, the next step in the improvement of the system would be for launching missiles at acquired targets while on the move. \u201cThe [mobile] launcher currently stops for two or three seconds to launch a missile, but it could be done on a move, without stopping,\u201d Druzin said.\n\nThe export version known as TOR M2E is also armed with the 9M331 interceptor, is designed as a short range air defense system, capable of intercepting air breathing and maneuvering targets at ranges of 1-12 km and altitudes from ground level (10 meters) to 10 km. Cruise missiles and drones could be killed at ranges of 1.5 km to 7 km maximum with precision guided weapons intercepted at a minimum distance of 50 meters and maximum range of six kilometers. Maximum target speed is 700 m/sec (2,520 km/h). A Tor M2E can engage four targets simultaneously, having up to eight missiles airborne. (four actively guided).\n\nThe export variants are also expected to be offered with the new interceptor.\nCamera: Nikon 5100 and Canon 5D\nLocation: Moscow Square - Victory Parade\nDate: April 30. 2014\nCameraman: George & Dimitry\n\nvideo youtube amazing amasing awesome interesting cool insane badass wall share channel topic search 2014 2015 2016 2017\nVIDEO WALL - http://www.georgedominik.tumblr.com/\nBLOG - http://www.georgedominik.blogspot.com/\n\u25ac\n\u2605 MORE INTERESTING VIDEOS:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUYH8swcp71EHt-88lkaMDTQ\n\n\u2605 SUBSCRIBE: http://goo.gl/GynuUU\n\u2605 Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/GeorgeDominik1\n\n\u2605 Thanks For Watching \n\u2605 Post comment , share and tell us what u think \n\u25ac\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ https://twitter.com/ http://www.wykop.pl/ http://www.liveleak.com/ http://www.pinterest.com/ http://www.tumblr.com/ http://www.reddit.com/ http://www.yandex.ru/ https://www.google.com http://vk.com/ http://www.bing.com/ http://www.ask.com/", "title": "New Russian Weapons 2014 - Tor-M2U air defence missile system", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T01:23:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1IlPCt7i6o", "description": "A lively version of an early searchers tune", "title": "Switchboard Susan", "publishedDate": "2013-12-08T12:34:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1Ix82Ot9O8", "description": "Noticeable glow inside a Pancake Pancake Geiger Muller Tube when exposed to a beam of x-rays.", "title": "Soft Xrays Pancake Geiger Muller Tube", "publishedDate": "2013-11-23T10:16:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1J3d3UoOk8", "description": "B-roll of B-Batt, 2nd BN., 3rd FA, firing the Excalibur round from a M777 Howitzer cannon.

In fact, it is really quite important. You can have that done by a blood test. Many people talk about not having enough Vitamin B12 and experiencing megaloblastic anemia. It can also lead to the demyelination of the nerves -- there is a white sealant around the nerves called myelin that protects the nerves, so that the signals don't become confused. Also, B12 is responsible for the subdivision of cells.  So, if you are not having enough B12, you can have serious nerve damage. \n\nHave your B12 levels tested.

To find out more visit http://www.thefa.com/News/2013/apr/find-the-founding-fathers-300413.aspx\n\nThe FA today kicks-off a nationwide search to find any living descendants of football's 'Founding Fathers'.\n\nHailing from across the country, surprisingly little is known about the eight trail-blazers who gathered on 26 October 1863 in the Freemasons' Tavern in London to draft the 13 original laws of association football.  \n\nFrom humble beginnings The FA is now in its 150th anniversary year, helping to support 7m people playing the game at grassroots level through to the elite level of 24 England teams.  \n\nAnd The FA have now called upon the public to come forward with any information on the eight men who established the world's most popular sport 150 years ago.\n\nThe Founding Fathers of football are Ebenezer Cobb Morley (1831-1924), Arthur Pember (1835-1886), Charles William Alcock (1842-1907), Francis Maule Campbell (1843-1920), John Forster Alcock (1841-1910), Herbert Thomas Steward (1839-1915), George Twizell Wawn (1840-1914) and James Turner.\n\nAny living descendants that can be identified and located will be invited to a special ceremony at Wembley to honour their ancestors in October. \n\nEngland Manager Roy Hodgson will be at the event and said: \"We should all recognise, not only the sporting contribution that these men have made, but the impact that football has had in this country and around the world.  \n\n\"Football is part of the fabric of our society and without the vision of these eight men 150 years ago, it may not have come to exist. It is only right that we honour the founding fathers of this nation's favourite game.\"\n\nAnd England goalkeeper Joe Hart is in agreement with his Manager, adding: \"It is important we honour those that did so much for football. Whatever your background, everyone can play football. You just need a ball and a place to play and it is pretty much the same now as it was 150 years ago. \n\n\"I had a chance to hold the priceless original minute book when The FA launched its anniversary year and it was pretty special to see the laws of the game as they were first written.\"\n\nJane Clayton, cultural historian from the International Football Institute, University of Central Lancashire is leading the search.\n\nShe added: \"This is an important historical search, we know so much about people who were pioneers in their chosen fields but surprisingly, little is known about the individuals responsible for gifting us the most popular sport in the world.  \n\n\"We have initiated the historical search and whilst information is limited, we have a good base upon which to work so we are confident that through genealogical research and the public's help, we can trace some of the living descendants of the founding fathers of football.\"", "title": "Football's Founding Fathers", "publishedDate": "2013-04-29T23:00:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1MYO3o13t8", "description": "Based on CT scans from human remains", "title": "Richard III facial reconstruction unveiled", "publishedDate": "2013-02-05T10:10:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1MkEsh0neE", "description": "HTML5 Game Development with Phaser by LYNDA- 6.1 Conclusion\n\nPhaser is a cross-platform game development framework for both mobile and desktop games.
