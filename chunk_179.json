Actually, this video is not such a bizzare musical experiment as it sounds! One of the most common of all the lyres of ancient Greece, the \"Lyra\", was quite literally, a \"banjo without a fingerboard\"...\n\nLike the banjo, the Lyra had a soundboard of taut skin, which was stretched over a resonator made out of a tortoise shell...which served exactly the same function as the resonator found on a contemporary Bluegrass-style 5 string banjo - to project and amplify the vibration of the strings. Also, as there were only between about 4 to 7 strings, open tunings were commonly used, for ease of playing arpeggios and basic harmony - for exactly the same reason that open chord and open modal tunings are used on the modern banjo!\n\nAlso, just as on a modern banjo, on the ancient Greek Lyra, the strings were stretched over a floating (ie non-fixed position) wooden bridge; the function of which served to transmit the vibrations of the strings to the skin soundboard & resonator - just like on a contemporary banjo!\n\nIndeed, about the ONLY differences between the ancient Lyra and the contemporary banjo, is the lack of a fretted fingerboard, the fact that the strings were made from either gut or natural fibre instead of loop-end steel...and just MAYBE, that the ancient Greeks hadn't quite yet discovered how to make MOONSHINE!;o)\n\nThis ancient, haunting melody by Mesomedes, written almost 2000 years ago, is known as \"Hymn to the Sun\".\n\nMesomedes of Crete was a Greek lyric poet and composer of the early 2nd century AD. I found the following information at:\n\nhttp://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/Mesomedes.html\n\n\"He was a freedman of the Emperor Hadrian, on whose favorite Antinous he is said to have written a panegyric, specifically called a Citharoedic Hymn (Suidas). Two epigrams by him in the Greek Anthology (Anthol. pal. xiv. 63, xvi. 323) are extant, and a hymn to Nemesis that begins \"Nemesis, winged balancer of life, dark-faced goddess, daughter of Justice\". The hymn is one of four which preserve the ancient musical notation written over the text. Two other hymns, one to the muse Calliope and [this one which I am playing], \"Hymn to the Sun\", formerly assigned to Dionysius of Alexandria, have also been attributed to Mesomedes. A total of 15 poems by Mesomedes are known...Prior to the discovery of the Seikilos epitaph in the late 19th century, the hymns of Mesomedes were the only surviving written music from the ancient world. Three were published by Vincenzo Galilei (the Father of the Astronomer Galileo Galilei) in his Dialogo della musica antica e della moderna (Florence, 1581), during a period of intense investigation into music of the ancient Greeks. These hymns had been preserved through the Byzantine tradition, and were presented to Vincenzo by Girolamo Mei\".\n\nThis piece is written in the ancient Greek \"Dorian\" mode; the equivalent intervals as heard in a scale of E-E on the white note of the piano - not to be confused with the MEDIEVAL \"Dorian\" mode, which was D-D!\n\nDue to a misinterpretation of the Latin texts of Boethius, mediaeval modes were given the wrong Greek names! For the CORRECT names of the ORIGINAL ancient Greek modes, see:\n\nhttp://www.harmonics.com/lucy/lsd/corrections.html\n\nFor what Plato & Aristotle themselves had this to say about these ancient musical modes, please see this fascinating link:\n\nhttp://www.pathguy.com/modes.htm\n\nYEEEE HA!

The only thing is, I think I was just in the nick of time to save a couple of them. Last time, I found a lot of these caterpillars in an over eaten pandakaki plant. I transfered them to a bigger and healthier pandakaki plant but, in a span of three days, they were eaten by the birds.\n\nHawk moth, name for the members of a family, Sphingidae, of large moths found in many parts of the world. They are also known as sphinx moths. They have stout bodies, relatively small, narrow wings and long tongues or proboscis. They fly chiefly at dusk.\n\n Because the hawk moths have relatively heavy bodies (packed with powerful muscles) and small, narrow triangular wings, they are not able to glide and can fly only with fast powerful beats. The wings moving so quickly that they can be seen only as a blur. The hawk moths can hover, with furiously beating wings, in front of a flower, extend their long tongue and suck up nectar without alighting.  Some of them can even fly backward.\n\n The caterpillars of hawk moths or sphinx are usually impressive and large, which in most species have a sharp horn at the rear end. Like most moths, their pupae are brown and smooth.A great many moth caterpillars merely dig down into the ground and there pupate with no cocoon.\n\nFor the \u201cPandakaki\u201d hawk moth,which I have called as such because the caterpillars lived on the leaves of the medicinal \u201cPandakaki\u201d plant, it took fourteen days in the pupal stage before the imago or the adult moth emerged.\n\nSources:  Grolier\u2019s \u201cThe Book of Knowledge\u201d 1962, Volume 18, pp.        \n                    6523-6540.\n        Encyclopedia International 1969 Volume 12, p.302 and \n                     Volume 8, p. 349.\n\nThese moths, Daphnis Nerii, are known as the Oleander Hawk Moth or Army Green Moth found in Mangaon, Maharashtra, India However, there the caterpillars feed mainly on oleander (Nerium oleander) leaves, a highly toxic plant to which toxicity they are immune. They also may feed on most plants of the Dogbane family, such as Adenium obesum, and Tabernaemontana divaricata and Alstonia scholaris in India.\n\n         The newborn caterpillars are pale blue. Their color changes to green as they grow. They have two spots resembling eyes on the forefront of their body.\n\n       The pupa is pale reddish or brownish-white and has a wax-like appearance. It lies directly on the earth, under moss or dry leaves.\n\n       Daphnis nerii is a large hawk-moth found in wide areas of Africa and Asia. It is a migratory species, flying to parts of eastern and southern Europe during the summer, particularly Turkey.\n\nSource: Wikipedia, \"Hawk Moth\" and \"Daphnis Nerii\".", "title": "Lovely Pets (Uncut 11)  Hawk Moth Caterpillar", "publishedDate": "2010-01-02T08:19:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "AHXgIK9DNSU", "description": "Adam Rayner visits the Farnham Angling Society's stretch of the River Loddon at Sindlesham Mill, Sindlesham, Berkshire ( tel: 01252 320871 www.farnhamanglingsociety.com SAT NAV RG41 5DF) for the Angler's Mail Where To Fish series.\n\nVisit our website... http://www.anglersmail.co.uk\nLike us on Facebook... http://www.facebook.com/AnglersMailMagazine\nFollow us @AnglersMail on Twitter\nReport your catches to: anglersmail@ipcmedia.com", "title": "RIVER LODDON, SINDLESHAM MILL, SINDLESHAM, BERKSHIRE", "publishedDate": "2013-08-01T10:04:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "AHY4tZ4A55M", "description": "This is a short clip of Michael Klemp as a lawyer.", "title": "MICHAEL KLEMP - LAWYER CLIP", "publishedDate": "2012-09-21T14:35:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "AHYRTnBzPHg", "description": "Cindy Zhou is back!!!!

To help people understand how the technology could be used, they brainstormed a selection of sample applications. Think of them as cognitive apps.

It's not easy to look through the viewfinder and judge whether the shot is in focus because it's such a wide angle lens and the depth of field is long.  I figured I could just set it to infinity and most subjects further than about 10-15 feet away would be pretty sharp, but I found that is not the case.  In fact, when setting the focus to infinity I find that nothing is in focus (not shown in the video).\n\nThis video illustrates a related problem.  I had the camera set up on a tripod and was trying to focus on a subject 3-4 meters away.  When I start from infinity and bring the focus closer until the subject is sharp, the focus is good at around the 1m mark on the lens barrel.  It seems like the markings on the lens barrel are way off, which is very problematic for a manual focus lens.  But when I set the focus to macro and rotate the focus ring to move the focus further away, now my subject is in focus at around the 3m mark on the lens barrel.\n\nIn summary:\n- Nothing is in focus when the lens is set to infinity focus.\n- To properly focus on a given subject, the position of the focus ring is different depending on which way you rotate the ring to achieve focus (IE starting at infinity vs. starting at macro).", "title": "Rokinon 14mm lens focusing issue", "publishedDate": "2014-03-23T19:10:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "AHwCNsXkXuk", "description": "The Bucking Bronco vigor blasts enemies and objects in front of Booker, levitating them in the air for a period of time, and allowing Booker to damage them without resistance.

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "The Definition of Love by Andrew Marvell", "publishedDate": "2014-02-15T23:18:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "AHx8xsp8EMI", "description": "RT performing 'Banish Misfortune' solo on  Videowest's 'Guitar Player Session' back in 1981.", "title": "Richard Thompson - Banish Misfortune - Videowest 81", "publishedDate": "2007-05-09T06:53:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "AHxnBTEO5yA", "description": "", "title": "Truk Gila.mp4", "publishedDate": "2012-05-18T08:04:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "AHyRjgnYvkI", "description": "BUY COINS - FAST & RELIABLE: http://bit.ly/1iQgRRI\nUse code: ITANI for 5% off\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Battilay-Cheap-Fifa-Coins/479355858772004?fref=ts\nhttps://twitter.com/Battilay\nCheap PSN Cards & Microsoft Points: http://goo.gl/JWfIsK\n\nFIFA 14 tif defoe 85 st in game stats and player review for Ultimate Team.

Their coloration generally serves as camouflage. When threatened, their first defense is to remain still to avoid detection. If approached too closely, they generally run in short bursts and stop abruptly to confuse the predator's visual acuity. If this fails, they puff up their body to cause it to look more horny, making it appear larger and more difficult to swallow. At least four species are also able to squirt an aimed stream of blood (see Autohaemorrhaging) from the corners of the eyes for a distance of up to five feet.[1][2][3] They do this by restricting the blood flow leaving the head, thereby increasing blood pressure and rupturing tiny vessels around the eyelids. This not only confuses predators, but also the blood tastes foul to canine and feline predators. It appears to have no effect against predatory birds. To avoid being picked up by the head or neck, a horned lizards ducks or elevates its head and orient its cranial horns straight up, or back. If a predator tries to take it by the body, the lizard drives that side of its body down into the ground so the predator cannot easily get its lower jaw underneath the lizard.\n\nJob 12:7, 9 \"But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:. . . Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?\" \n\nHave you ever watched ducks out on an icy lake paddling around in the near-freezing water? They will spend much of the day in that one spot with the temperature well below freezing, and yet the cold doesn't seem to bother them. Perhaps on shore there are some sparrows hopping around in the snow. One wonders: Why don't birds need shoes and socks?\n\nIf you or I ran around with bare feet and legs when the temperature was below freezing, it would not be very long before we had a good case of frostbite. We could even lose so much body heat that our very lives would be threatened.\n\nBirds have a network of arteries that all blood going into their legs must enter. These arteries are interwoven with the veins returning from the foot. When the blood going to the foot enters this structure, called a \"wonder net,\" its temperature is 106 degrees Fahrenheit. The blood returning from the foot at the same time is only 37 degrees. The warm blood passing through the net reheats the cold blood coming from the foot before it enters the body. The result is that the bird loses very little body heat. So the blood going into the foot never becomes dangerously cold in normal winter weather.\n\nThe wisdom of this design is obvious. Could birds have survived having their feet frozen off before they learned to evolve this special arrangement? Our only conclusion can be that there is a Creator who cares for all of His creation, including you and me!\n\nPrayer: \nThank You, Lord, that Your hand is evident in all the creation. Help me to better see Your hand in my life, both leading me and protecting me. Amen. \n\nNotes: \n\"Why don't ducks' feet freeze?\" Science Digest, Feb. 1984. p. 76.", "title": "Why Birds Don't Need Socks?", "publishedDate": "2011-11-07T11:24:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "AHypYl5pp90", "description": "Wir sind jetzt \u00fcber eine Million Pandas!!!

But in reality, these facilities will become de facto US military bases.\" \n\nFriction over the South China Sea has surged as China uses its growing naval might to more forcefully assert its vast claims over the oil and gas rich sea.\n\nBrunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have overlapping claims with China.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntd.tv\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\u00a0\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "Filipino Activists Denounce Granting U.S. Military Access", "publishedDate": "2013-07-04T19:37:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "AINy3JbDolQ", "description": "Facebook: http://facebook.com/goldencoastofficial\nInstagram: \nhttp://instagram.com/goldencoastadam\nhttp://instagram.com/levijarvas\nhttp://instagram.com/magyarmatyi\n\nFacebook:Fancy https://www.facebook.com/fannnytm?fref=ts\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/fanybaba\n\nZene:Smith\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SMITHMUSIX?fref=ts\nInstagram:http://instagram.com/smithmusix\n\nSz\u00f6veg:Mandula \u00c1d\u00e1m, Magyar Matyi(MM)\nRefr.\nTudom milyen \u00e9rz\u00e9s csal\u00f3dni\nHogy forgol\u00f3dsz egyed\u00fcl kell aludni,\nDe nincs \u00e9rzelem m\u00e1r hi\u00e1ba,\nMert te vagy aki hib\u00e1kkal is hib\u00e1tlan.\n(X2)\n\n\n\u00c9n voltam ki seg\u00edtett, hogy meg\u00e9ld a v\u00e1gyaid,\nKi mindig t\u00e1mogatott, hogy el\u00e9rhesd az \u00e1lmaid.\nKi mindk\u00e9t kez\u00e9t ny\u00fajtotta, ha nem volt veled senki,\nHa nagy gond is volt \u00e1t\u00f6lelt, nem \u00e9rdekelte semmi.\nDe m\u00e1r nem ismerlek, nem tudom hogy ki vagy,\nHogy hogy lehett\u00e9l az, aki az \u00e9let\u00e9b\u0151l kihagy.\nKi volt az a kisl\u00e1ny, aki \u0151szint\u00e9n ny\u00edlt meg nekem,\nKi azt mondta hogy szeret \u00e9s a vil\u00e1ga sokkal szebb velem.\n\n\nRefr.\nTudom milyen \u00e9rz\u00e9s csal\u00f3dni\nHogy forgol\u00f3dsz egyed\u00fcl kell aludni,\nDe nincs \u00e9rzelem m\u00e1r hi\u00e1ba,\nMert te vagy aki hib\u00e1kkal is hib\u00e1tlan.\n(X2)\n\n\nBoldog voltam melletted, te volt\u00e1l nekem az egyetlen,\nNem vigy\u00e1ztam r\u00e1d el\u00e9gg\u00e9, kett\u0151nk k\u00f6z\u00fcl \u00e9n vesztettem.\nNem nem, nem fogadom el, \u00e9n tudom te nem vagy hazug.\nMindig megb\u00edztam benned, soha nem voltak tabuk.\n\u0150szint\u00e9n mondom bel\u00e1ttam, hogy nem vert\u00e9l \u00e1t soha,\n\u00c9s tudom hogy minden dolognak megvan az igazi oka.\nTudom hogy gyakran hib\u00e1ztam, \u00e9s sokszor voltam egy rohad\u00e9k,\nDe komolyan mondom az \u00e9letemben nem szerettem \u00edgy soha m\u00e9g.\n\nN\u00e9zd meg, hogy hogyan v\u00e1ltunk kett\u00e9,\nIm\u00e1dtalak m\u00e9gis darabokra szedt\u00e9l.\n\u00dagy f\u00e1j, hogy itt hagyt\u00e1l,\nAz \u00e9letedb\u0151l v\u00e9gleg kiz\u00e1rt\u00e1l.\nNincs m\u00e1s, tudod nem kell m\u00e1r senki,\nNem fogok tudni m\u00e1ssal betelni,\nCsak te kellesz nekem,\nCsak veled lehet sz\u00e9p az \u00e9letem.\n\n\nRefr.\nTudom milyen \u00e9rz\u00e9s csal\u00f3dni\nHogy forgol\u00f3dsz egyed\u00fcl kell aludni,\nDe nincs \u00e9rzelem m\u00e1r hi\u00e1ba,\nMert te vagy aki hib\u00e1kkal is hib\u00e1tlan.\n(X2)\n\n\nMi\u00e9rt \u00e9rzem \u00fagy, nekem csakis te vagy teremtve,\nMi\u00e9rt \u00e9rzed \u00fagy, soha nem volt\u00e1l szeretve,\nMi\u00e9rt \u00e9rzem \u00fagy, t\u00fal hamar lettem temetve,\nA f\u00e1jdalomt\u00f3l s\u00edrtam, m\u00edg te tov\u00e1bb ment\u00e9l nevetve.\nMi\u00e9rt \u00e9rzem \u00fagy, hogy nem \u00e9rzem hogy el\u00e9g volt,\nMi\u00e9rt \u00e9rzed \u00fagy, hogy \u00e9n nem lehetn\u00e9k el\u00e9g j\u00f3,\nMi\u00e9rt \u00e9rzem \u00fagy, hogy nem hangzott el el\u00e9g sz\u00f3,\nSajn\u00e1lom, hogy a szerelmedre nem lehettem m\u00e9lt\u00f3.\nMi\u00e9rt \u00e9rzem \u00fagy, hogy kettesben te m\u00e1s volt\u00e1l,\nMi\u00e9rt \u00e9rzed \u00fagy, hogy j\u00f3 volt hogy elp\u00e1rtolt\u00e1l,\nMi\u00e9rt \u00e9rzem \u00fagy, t\u00fal hamar vagy t\u00fal t\u00e1vol m\u00e1r,\nMi volt az oka annak, hogy te t\u00fal hirtelen v\u00e1ltott\u00e1l?\nMi\u00e9rt \u00e9rzem \u00fagy, hogy nem szerettem t\u00e9vesen,\nMi\u00e9rt \u00e9rzed \u00fagy, hogy hideg m\u00e1r a k\u00e9t kezem,\nMi\u00e9rt \u00e9rzem \u00fagy, hogy maradt benned f\u00e9lelem,\nDe ak\u00e1rmit is tett\u00e9l, nem kell m\u00e1sik \u00e9nnekem.\n\nRefr.\nTudom milyen \u00e9rz\u00e9s csal\u00f3dni\nHogy forgol\u00f3dsz egyed\u00fcl kell aludni,\nDe nincs \u00e9rzelem m\u00e1r hi\u00e1ba,\nMert te vagy aki hib\u00e1kkal is hib\u00e1tlan.\n(X2)", "title": "Golden Coast -

Voiced by the incomparably incredible Cameron Gill.\n\nPart 17:  Philip Polarius, Actor\n\nGood afternoon or evening or morning or night my dear audience.  Tis I, Philip Polarius, the most illustrious actor the town of Coosburg has ever seen.  You may recognize my name from the playbill of the Coosburg Players' production of \"Aunt Polly's Secret Abortion\" in which I played the lead, Dr. Flush-itout.  I've also been in many local commercials, a slew of newspaper ads and my most recent employer had me alert the passing public that his place of employment was offering cash in exchange for gold, through the use of creative movements and state of the art arrow-shaped signage.\n\nMoving on to the matter at hand, you my dear friends are in for a treat.  I, Philip Polarius, was in the town square when the largest meteor struck the meeting of the Sheriff, Pierre, and Sezame.  I had taken shelter in the mailbox and was mere feet away from their discussion.  So while no video or audio devices captured the historic conversation, it will live on forever thanks to the exquisite acting prowess of the incredible Philip Polarius!  So, without further delay, through the magic of theatre, I present, the conversation.\n\n\"Behold my magnificence, for I am Count Oppenheimer Sezame, the epitome of power!\"\n\"Peh, I know who you are, you ridiculous thing.  You claim to be a being of supreme power and look at you.  Halted by me and my army of beautiful mime soldiers.\"\n\"Hay! My depooties and me stopped both your faces.  Now git outta Coosburg.  Ya'll killed everybody!\"\n\"Now hold on por un minute.  While I acknowledge that the losses seen by all of us are tremendous, though not as tremendous as your waistline monsieur, there is a greater problem we face.  It appears that lady in the factory is intent on killing us all, and if not stopped she may very well destroy the entire gloobe.\"\n\"Gloobe?\"\n\"Oui, gloobe.  The whoole gloobe!\"\n\"But I live on the glube!\"\n\"Glube?\"\n\"Shud we work tugether to stop her?\"\n\"I don't know about you mere mortals, but I am a dark magic lord.  I do not need the aid of a slack-jawed buffoon and the silent tai-chi of a clown to defeat a woman flinging pebbles.\"\n\"Those pebbles are from space, and made of Lutetium.  We both know your dark magic has no effect of Lutetium.  You need my barriers to protect you.  So why don't you just swallow your pride and together we will save this world.  Mostly me, but I am generous so I say we, oui?\"\n\"Count Oppenheimer Sezame needs no one!  I am a great and-\"\n\"Hey Look, a giant rock!\"\n\nJust then the huge boulder came crashing down on them.  It shook the very Earth I stood on...well, it shook the very earth I sat in mailbox on.  Miraculously, they were fine, for Pierre had mimed a protective dome at the last moment.  Much like my day-saving performance in the Coosburg Players' production of \"Why Let Women Vote?\" when I improvised a moving speech as my character threw the last female character into the furnace.

The size I'm using is 22\" x 13\"\n- Different color yarn. I used Red Heart yarn, but you can use softer yarn if you want your rug to be more plush. Depending on how many colors and how big your rug is going to be, will result in how much yarn it will take. I used 4 different colors and only gone through half of each color.\n\n- A pair of scissors to snip off the excess yarn.\n\nPom Pom tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCoDBtkkBKM", "title": "(\u3063\u25d5\u203f\u25d5)\u3063\u2665 DIY: Pom Pom Rug", "publishedDate": "2014-03-03T22:10:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "AId_zEksOnw", "description": "Playing around with random terrain generation, texturing and destructible landscapes in Brutal Serenity.\n\nMusic: ~ Not So Silent Night ~   By - Catstuffer", "title": "Brutal Serenity [Destructibility Test]", "publishedDate": "2011-12-20T01:52:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "AIdaOiY1M2w", "description": "\u201cI got a missed call from your b*tch!\u201d\n\nCheck out more awesome videos on BuzzfeedYellow https://www.youtube.com/user/BuzzFeedYellow\n\nMUSIC\nBoth Coasts\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nFEATURING\nQuinta Brunson\nhttp://instagram.com/quintab\nhttps://www.youtube.com/quintabvideos\nhttps://twitter.com/quintabrunson\n\nGET MORE BUZZFEED:\nwww.buzzfeed.com\nwww.buzzfeed.com/video\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeed\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedvideo\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedyellow\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedblue\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedpop\nwww.youtube.com/cnnbuzzfeed\n\nBUZZFEED VIDEO\nBuzzFeed is the world's first true social news organization.

Two of our founding fathers didn't sign it. Thomas Jefferson was off representing the US in France and John Adams was pulling diplomat duty in Great Britain. \n\nNumber 9. It contains spelling errors. Among them is the misspelling of Pennsylvania. Also, many may be relieved to know that even the brainy guys behind the Constitution had a tough time knowing when not to use the apostrophe in 'its'.\n\nNumber 8. The US has the shortest constitution. Among the rule writers of the modern world the early Americans were the most brief. They outlined the laws of the land in only 44 hundred words. For comparison, the longest constitution is India's, which in English has over 117 thousand words. \n\nNumber 7. The US was relatively small when the Constitution was signed. There were only 4 million people in the country, and the largest city, Philadelphia, had a mere 40 thousand residents. \n\nNumber 6. There was a lot of debate about what to call the president. One suggestion was \"His Highness the President of the United States of America and Protector of their Liberties.\" Eventually, the House and Senate settled on President of the United States. \n\nNumber 5. James Madison wasn't entirely overlooked. If you feel that President Madison, regarded as 'the father of the Constitution', was shafted because he's never been memorialized on money, rest easy.  He's on the super-rare 5 thousand dollar bill, as well as the one dollar coin.\n\nNumber 4. Americans are getting older. At the time the constitution was penned, the median age in the country was 16. Nowadays it's in the mid 30s. \n\nNumber 3. The scribe who inked the Constitution was only paid $30. Of course, that's over 700 dollars in today's money. It was paid to one Jacob Shallus, a clerk for the Pennsylvania General Assembly. \n\nNumber 2. The Constitution refers to 'others'. By that, the authors meant those belonging to ethnic minorities. \n\nNumber 1. Not all of those who signed the Constitution were born in the US. 4 of them came from Ireland.\n\nWhat interesting things do you know about the US constitution?", "title": "10 Uncommon Facts About The US Constitution", "publishedDate": "2014-07-03T12:27:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "AIfHern35Yc", "description": "Antigen is an attack-oriented puzzle game for Android devices.

We did not anticipate that it would be so dramatic a reversal in all of the problems that the animal was experiencing,\" said Dr. Ronald DiPinho, professor of medicine and genetics at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, and co-author of the paper published Sunday in the journal Nature. \"We were so struck by the findings that we rushed to get the study published.\"\nA human cell holds 23 pairs of chromosomes, each containing protective caps at each end called telomeres. Enzymes called telomerases protect the telomeres and reduce DNA damage thought to contribute to tissue aging. But as we age, our cells produce less telomerase; telomeres are cut shorter and eventually fail to protect DNA from damage.\nResearchers boosted telomerase in the mice cells -- which hold 20 pairs of chromosomes -- to prevent telomeres from getting shorter. They found restoring the enzyme not only stopped aging but revived failing organs and even restored dark fur to mice who had turned grey. DePinho said the mice that were equivalent to ages 80 to 90 in human years returned to the equivalent of middle age.\n\"This [research] indicates there's a point of return for these tissues,\" said DePinho. \"The fact that you can bring a tissue to the brink and then bring it back this dramatically is remarkable.\"\nPrevious studies suggest that even in humans, shorter telomeres may be associated with age-related diseases such as heart disease and Alzheimer's disease.\nIn fact, the brains of the age-modified mice were 75 percent of the size of a normal brain, much as happens in a patient with Alzheimer's disease. But when researchers reactivated the telomerase, the brains returned to a normal size, according to the study.\nThe aging process is complex and telomeres are just one element that contributes to its course. But DePinho said this is one step in learning more about not only the slowing of aging, but also the reversal.\n\"Telomere dynamics in mice has taught us the role of telomeres in [diseases like] cancer and helped us better understand how to take advantage of these situations,\" said DePinho.\n\nNobel Prize,\n for Medicine for 2009 was awarded to a group of scientists who discovered how chromosomes work and telomeres and how they impact on our health and aging.\n Money in Sisli International,\n as MLM Distributor,\n or become a preferred customer and get 20procent discounts on all products!!\n It's not just TS-X which supports the health of your telomeres, but hair shampoos, effective products for weight loss, night creams, etc.\n No obligation to purchase each month, (it's up to you ... )\n no monthly fees, and many other benefits ... more will be told after registration in a closed group on fb.\n I look forward to working with you.\n REGISTRATION : http://yourprofit.mysisel.com/en/GB/home.htm\nFacebook group : https://www.facebook.com/groups/189789707851392/#!/groups/189789707851392/", "title": "ABC News / Protection Telomeres - They can return to youth !!!", "publishedDate": "2013-06-22T19:01:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "AImYAPif9nk", "description": "For more info:\n\n**Disclaimer: I am not a professional hairstylist.

But those fast slashes that he performs are basically impossible to parry unless you correctly guess (and yes I mean guess) that they're coming. As it is this was hard enough.\n\nThe hardest part about this battle is that the Pyromancer's Set has no poise so every single attack he hits you with will stagger you. You can see this with the fast slashes that he hits me with. Without a shield you HAVE to parry the next slash or dodge it to survive and I found there were some issues with the game not registering parries right after you were staggered, so I had to sort of move forward at the same time to counteract that.\n\nIt might be possible to be a bit more passive and stay out of his fast slashing reach if you want to do a no hit, no shield fight but Gwyn is so aggressive it's a very difficult prospect.

A pumpkin is loaded into a sling and the rope is cut with an ax. When weights drop, the payload is hurled onward and upward eventually landing with a splat in a nearby sorghum field\n     \"They really explode nice when they hit,\" Mommsen says. \"Pumpkins will go about 100 yds. and maybe 150 ft. in the air. I can launch anything from 10 to 60 lbs. without affecting distance since I can adjust for weight by shortening the launch.\"\nThe catapult was fired every 12 minutes (that's how long it takes for the arm to stop swinging and retie and reload) on weekends up through Halloween.\n     \"We've launched hundreds of pumpkins,\" says Mommsen, adding that the pumpkins used were rotten or damaged.

Scholars think CCP's (Chinese\nCommunist Party) culture created China's anomic society.\n\nXinhua.org and People.com.cn reproduced the report\npublished by Yangcheng Evening News.\n\nThe Xinhua.org' article is entitled, \"RUC Associate Professor\nBlasts Student Union: A Microcosm of the Ugly Officialdom.\"\n\nChen Wei says in his article titled, \"Students Union: Univ.'s\nDarkest Corner,\" the Student Union should be independent.\n\nBut in reality, it has become a tool for the Communist Youth\nLeague and the universities/colleges to control students.\n\nHe points out that CCP members' groups\nand the Communist Youth League organizations,\n\nutilize the strength of its system to lure students to deprave,\nand to force the female students into prostitution,\n\ntirelessly corrupting the students. The Youth League\norganizations and the Student Union\n\nspare no effort in turning the university students\ninto hostages of bureaucratic and vulgar approaches.\n\nChen indicated that student leaders are privileged stratum\nat the universities.\n\nAwards at universities are established and selected\nby the Communist Youth League,\n\nso the final award falls on student leaders,\nand will be a credit toward their postgraduate exemption.\n\nThe Communist Youth League or Student Union is a shortcut\ninto politics. This has become a common model in China.\n\nJiao Guobiao (former Associate Professor of Journalism,\nPeking University): \"Student Union is a small officialdom,\n\nfor the integral framework is a unified bureaucratic system,\nwithout a truly autonomous mass organization.\n\nOther so-called social organizations have the same nature,\nsuch as the Youth League and Women's Federation,\n\nall of these mass organizations are officialdoms.\"\n\nChen Wei described the universities as having become\nthe first stage for students to rehears on\n\nall kinds of wicked practices in China's current society\nand political system. How to take hints from the leadership,\n\nhow to accompany a leader for a drink, to talk officiously\nand speak lies, to fawn on, to utilize their power, etc.\n\nBy learning these practices of China's officialdom,\na 20-year-old college student becomes corrupted for life.\n\nChen Wei witnessed a simple, idealistic freshman's change.\nAfter assuming the role of a Student Union president,\n\n\nNTD reporters Chang Chun, Li Yuanhan and Xiao Yu\n\n\u300a\u795e\u97f5\u300b2011\u4e16\u754c\u5de1\u6f14\u65b0\u4eae\u70b9\nhttp://www.ShenYunPerformingArts.org/", "title": "Student Union \"A Land of Filth\"", "publishedDate": "2011-10-05T12:13:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "AIzm5S8kekk", "description": "ORIGINAL RAGGAMUFFIN HUGH MIKES\nFOR BEST DUBPLATES AND JINGLES CONTACT POLY FAME\n\nEcstatic Sound : https://soundcloud.com/ecstatic-sound\n\n/GRAFARTONE/", "title": "HUGH MIKES - ECSTATIC STORY - DUBPLATE", "publishedDate": "2014-03-25T14:15:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "AIzugnxc6Dg", "description": "A Charamba\n\nMyrica Faya\n\nAuto-generated by YouTube.", "title": "A Charamba", "publishedDate": "2014-11-07T04:42:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "AIzxrZ3O2JM", "description": "Maggots of Cordylobia anthropophaga, \"Mangoworms\", are being removed from the skin of a Gambian local dog.\nThanks to Fatou for her good help!\nhttp://www.vetclinicgambia.com", "title": "Cordylobia anthropohaga - Mangoworms, Gambian local dog", "publishedDate": "2012-10-28T19:49:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJ-Dc3WJwY0", "description": "Aryah and I goofing around to Ray Stevens", "title": "Jeremiah Peabody's Polyunsaturated quick dissolving fast ac", "publishedDate": "2014-04-23T07:28:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJ-LsK6fJqE", "description": "Short video shot with the Sigma 150-500mm F5-6.3 APO DG OS HSM showing the immense focal length of the lens.\nFor more check out the review on MegaPixel.co.il", "title": "Sigma 150-500mm F5-6.3 APO DG OS HSM - Focal Length Demo", "publishedDate": "2014-03-23T20:17:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJ-kzauGYVM", "description": "As One - Shin\u97d3\u6587\u653e\u90014(\u7cd6\u59b9\u5b78\u97d3\u6587)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVonqxhZBjU&feature=youtu.be\n\nAs One - Shin\u97d3\u6587\u653e\u90012(\u6f6e\u8a9e - daebak)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg2gY-b9UFA&feature=plcp\n\nAs One\u7c21\u4ecb:\n\u9999\u6e2f\u8df3\u5531\u5973\u5b50\u7d44\u5408\uff0c\u65bc2012\u5e746\u6708\u6b63\u5f0f\u51fa\u9053\uff0c\u7531\u592a\u967d\u5a1b\u6a02\u6587\u5316\u65d7\u4e0bSun Star\uff0c\u806f\u540c\u90ed\u5bcc\u57ce\u5fa1\u7528\u6392\u821e\u5e2bSunny Wong\uff0c\u7c4c\u5099\u8d85\u904e\u4e00\u5e74\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u8df3\u5531\u5973\u5b50\u7d44\u5408\u3002\u56db\u4f4d\u591a\u624d\u591a\u85dd\u6210\u54e1\u5305\u62ecShin\u3001Oli\u3001Nata\u3001Elfa\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e9e\u6d32\u70ba\u6230\u7565\u5c0e\u5411\uff0c\u76ee\u6a19\u6210\u70ba\u4ee3\u8868\u9999\u6e2f\u7684\u4e9e\u6d32\u4eba\u6c23\u5076\u50cf\u5929\u5718\u3002\n\n\u300cAs One\u300d\u6709\u300c\u5718\u7d50\u300d\u3001\u300c\u5408\u70ba\u4e00\u9ad4\u300d\u7684\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u5bd3\u610f\u56db\u4eba\u5718\u7d50\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7336\u5982\u4e00\u9ad4\u3002\u5718\u540d\u7e2e\u5beb\u70ba\u300cA1\u300d\uff0c\u800c\u300cA\u300d\u8207\u300c1\u300d\u5206\u5225\u662f\u5b57\u6bcd\u8207\u6578\u5b57\u4e4b\u9996\uff0c\u6545\u5718\u540d\u4ea6\u6709\u6210\u54e1\u4e8b\u4e8b\u76e1\u529b\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u62ff\u53d6\u00ad\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e4b\u610f\u3002\n\nYoutube As One Channel:http://www.youtube.com/user/AsOneChannel\nAs One Facebook Fans Page : http://www.facebook.com/#!/AsOneHK\nAs One \u5fae\u535a:http://weibo.com/asonehk\n\nAs One\u6210\u54e1\u500b\u4ebaFacebook:\nShin: http://www.facebook.com/Katarinashin \nOli:http://www.facebook.com/#!/oli.wong.98\nNata: http://www.facebook.com/asone.nata\nElfa: http://www.facebook.com/elfayau\n\nAs One\u6210\u54e1\u500b\u4ebaInstagram:\nShin: asone_shin\nNata: asone_nata\nOli: asone_oli\nElfa: asone_elfa\n\nAs One\u6210\u54e1\u500b\u4eba\u5fae\u535a:\nhttp://weibo.com/n/AsOne_Shin\nhttp://weibo.com/n/AsOne_Oli\nhttp://weibo.com/n/AsOne_Nata\nhttp://weibo.com/n/AsOne_Elfa\n\n\u5de5\u4f5c\u806f\u7d61:\nEmail: penny.ngan@suneg.com", "title": "As One - Shin\u97d3\u6587\u653e\u90013(\u8a31\u5ef7\u93d7\u5b78\u97d3\u6587)", "publishedDate": "2012-10-11T07:21:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJ-soKc-Hws", "description": "Pre-order \u201cThe London Sessions\u201d album now and get \u201cTherapy\u201d instantly\nhttp://smarturl.it/thelondonsessions \n\u201cThe London Sessions\u201d Out December 2nd \n\nhttp://thequeeninlondon.com\n#thelondonsessions\n\nFollow Mary:\nhttp://twitter.com/maryjblige\nhttp://facebook.com/maryjblige \nhttp://instagram.com/therealmaryjblige", "title": "Mary J.

Here we show that the magnetically levitating pyrolytic graphite can be moved in the arbitrary place by simple photoirradiation. It is notable that the optical motion control system described in this paper requires only NdFeB permanent magnets and light source. The optical movement is driven by photothermally induced changes in the magnetic susceptibility of the graphite. Moreover, we demonstrate that light energy can be converted into rotational kinetic energy by means of the photothermal property. We find that the levitating graphite disk rotates at over 200 rpm under the sunlight, making it possible to develop a new class of light energy conversion system.", "title": "Optical Motion Control of Maglev Graphite", "publishedDate": "2012-12-19T12:01:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJ7i5R1TUSo", "description": "xylem in angiosperm, xylem vessels, xyem parenchyma, xylem fibers, xylem in gymnosperms, tracheids with bordered pits, xylem fibers, xylem parenchyma represented in resin ducts, phloem in angisperms, sieve tube cell, companion cells, phloem parenchyma, phoem in gymnosperms, sieve cells, albuminous cells, phloem parenchyma, xylem vessels lignification, vascular bundles", "title": "Vascular tissue system", "publishedDate": "2011-04-11T22:24:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJ7pJf-Hdgg", "description": "Construction of verner Callipers (telugu)", "title": "vernier callipers 1", "publishedDate": "2012-09-02T16:21:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJ7xiUyc-nQ", "description": "Ripped directly from my N64, using my capture card.\n\nI do not own this song, Hey You, Pikachu! is \u00a9 Nintendo and Ambrella.", "title": "Hey You, Pikachu!

In Northeast India they are present in all the states except Arunachal Pradesh. This dispersal across international borders is mainly attributed to the British colonial policy.\nThe term Kuki, in literature, first appeared in the writing of Rawlins when he wrote about the tribes of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. It refers to \"wild tribe\" comprising numerous clans. These clans share a common past, culture, customs and tradition. They speak in dialects that have a common root language belonging to the Tibeto-Burman group.\nThe Kukis have Mongoloid features and are generally short-stature with straight black hair and dark brown eyes. The different Kuki clans are recognised as scheduled tribe of India.This tribe recognition is based on the dialect spoken and region. Kuki is composed of many different entities and clans.\n\nNagaland, 'The Land of Festivals' and the warm Naga people, lies in the North Eastern part of India. Historically, the Nagas are known as headhunters and have always been brave warriors.\n\nSometimes Nagaland is also referred to as \"The Switzerland of the East\". The region is primarily hilly and has a pleasant climate all through the year. It is perhaps the best place for the adventurous at heart and makes an ideal place for trekking and camping. \n\nAlso known as Paradise on earth  The Dzukou Valley is the most famed valley of Nagaland and the natural beauty of the area is absolutely captivating.\n\nAnother attraction for tourists is the Kohima War Cemetry. The cemetery is a tribute to the soldiers who laid down their lives pushing back the Japanese army during the Second World War. The bodies of around 1,100 British and 330 Indian soldiers are buried here.\n\nOne of the biggest cathedrals of North East India is located at Aradura Hill in Kohima. Its magnificent architecture makes it an important landmark of Kohima.\n\nThe Hornbill Festival is named after the Hornbill, a large, magnificent forest bird. \nHeld every year at the Naga Heritage Village in Kisama about 12 kms from Kohima, the festival is held over a period of 7 days annually. The entire Heritage Village was built for the sole purpose of hosting this festival and the16 tribes of Nagaland each have their own representative hut in the village. Organized by the Govt. of Nagaland, the festival showcases the entire spectrum of the rich culture of the various naga tribes. \nThe hornbill festival was created to bring together the various tribes of the State to display their culture and tradition in the form of dances, songs, sports, foods and many other colourful events. People from within India as well as foreign visitors experience and witness the colourful festival with great enthusiasm.\n\nDelicious, mouth-watering and typically Naga food from the different tribes is served in various huts or morungs. Each Morung also has its own restaurant, which serves their specific tribal delicacy. Rice beer is always in great demand and tourists don't mind standing in long serpentine queues for a taste of the same.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Barton, Markus Blunder \n\nDIRECTED BY: Markus Blunder\n\nSYNOPSIS: Two young orphans in the Tirolian Mountains come under siege by a vicious band of hunters. Frightened of being separated by child services following the death of their mother, a self-sufficient 16-year-old girl (Sophie Lowe) and her 10-year-old brother (Maximilian Harnisch) - who hasn't spoken a word since seeing his father killed by the mayor (Peter Stormare) - strive to live off the land in peace. Their innocence is shattered, however, when a group of hunters led by the mayor's son brutalizes and rapes the free-spirited girl. Later, when a well-meaning social services worker arrives too late to protect the terrorized siblings, the girl and her brother prepare to take a stand against their ruthless attackers.\n\nGENRE: Thriller\n\n\nDISTRIBUTOR:\nARC Entertainment\n\n\nRATED:\nR\nfor violence including rape, and nudity\n\n\nRUNTIME: 100 minutes\n\n\"Autumn Blood\" \"Autumn Blood movie\" \"Autumn Blood trailer\" \"Markus Blunder\" \"Sophie Lowe\" \"Peter Stormare\" \"Gustaf Skarsgard\" oprhans girl rape hunter mayor brother sister attacker thriller jslewis", "title": "Autumn Blood Official Trailer 1 (2014) - Peter Stormare Thriller HD", "publishedDate": "2014-08-29T17:19:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJCCzJKOFHg", "description": "map;http://osu.ppy.sh/s/58737", "title": "Osu!

Somalia has few mineral resources\u2014only some deposits of tin, phosphate, gypsum, guano, coal, iron ore, and uranium\u2014and both quantity and quality are too low for mining to be worthwhile. However, the deposits of the clay mineral sepiolite, or meerschaum, in south-central Somalia are among the largest known reserves in the world. Reserves of natural gas have been found but have not been exploited. Sea salt is collected at several sites on the coast.\n\nSepiolite is used in oil drilling...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepiolite\n\n- - - The extraordinary properties of this clay make it a highly sought after mineral, despite its scarcity in the Earth's crust.\n\n\"The future of sepiolites in the household is outside the litter box. Already today, they absorb liquid spillages and odours and stabilise aqueous products like paints, resins and inks. In synthetic form, they could bind food products and stabilise drugs, extending their shelf life and making sepiolite an edible product\"\nhttp://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Sepiolites-diffraction/\n\n- - - Sepiolite \nis a complex magnesium silicate clay material that functions as a suspending aid in salt-water based spacers.  Sepiolite is a non-swelling clay that can absorb approximately its own weight of water and other liquids without the granules disintegrating when saturated. Once dispersed in the liquid spacer system using a high-shear mixer, Sepiolite entraps the liquid, increasing the viscosity of the suspension.  This structure is stable even in systems with high salt concentrations.\nhttp://www.halliburton.com/ps/default.aspx?pageid=5486&navid=2208&prodid=PRN::LPMK1I97Q\n\n- - - Natural gas - proved reserves: 5.663 billion cu m (1 January 2011 est.)\n\nDefinition: This entry is the stock of proved reserves of natural gas in cubic meters (cu m). Proved reserves are those quantities of natural gas, which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated with a high degree of confidence to be commercially recoverable from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic conditions.\n\nSource: CIA World Factbook - Unless otherwise noted, information in this page is accurate as of February 21, 2013\n\n- - - The Great Game in Somalia\n\nBy Abid Mustafa\n\nThe recent upsurge in fighting between the various factions in Somalia is a typical example of wars being fought throughout the African continent where the real benefactor is neither the people nor local governments, but major powers. Somalia is another country that has been caught up in a vicious struggle between great powers competing against each other to control the Horn of Africa.\n\nThe reason for this interference in Somalia's internal affairs is simple. Somalia is replete with abundance of natural resources. Uranium deposits, oil and natural gas can be found in Somalia. Oil seeps were discovered in the colonial era by both British and Italian geologists. Later, French and American oil companies competed with British and Italian oil companies for concession rights to the exploration of oil. In the years to follow Somalia became a battle ground between Europe and America for the right to control Somalia's oil wealth. Europe led by Britain fought America through supporting local militias and surrogate countries like Kenya, Uganda and Djibouti, while America supported her militiamen through countries like Ethiopia and Sudan. The power struggle between Europe and America contributed to decades of civil war, secessionist movements and break away states.\n\nMore: http://www.globalpolitician.com/print.asp?id=1838\n\n- - - How Jimmy Carter and I Started the Mujahideen\nhttp://www.counterpunch.org/1998/01/15/how-jimmy-carter-and-i-started-the-mujahideen/\n\n- - - Brzezinski: Six months before Soviet invasion, we financed the Mujahideen\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGjAsQJh7OM\n\n\n\n.", "title": "133k Somalia famine child deaths", "publishedDate": "2013-05-02T23:04:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJGYi6wyoo4", "description": "The Wilson Combat Checkered Front Strap for 1911 is an excellent buy for someone trying to improve grip.

Two of these species are native to Africa and three to Southern Asia.\n\nMembers of the rhinoceros family are characterized by their large size (they are some of the largest remaining megafauna, with all of the species able to reach one tonne or more in weight); as well as by an herbivorous diet; a thick protective skin, 1.5--5 cm thick, formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure; relatively small brains for mammals this size (400--600 g); and a large horn. They generally eat leafy material, although their ability to ferment food in their hindgut allows them to subsist on more fibrous plant matter, if necessary. Unlike other perissodactyls, the two African species of rhinoceros lack teeth at the front of their mouths, relying instead on their powerful premolar and molar teeth to grind up plant food.\n\nKaziranga National Park is a national park in the Golaghat and Nagaon districts of the state of Assam, India. A World Heritage Site, the park hosts two-thirds of the world's Great One-horned Rhinoceroses. Kaziranga boasts the highest density of tigers among protected areas in the world and was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006. The park is home to large breeding populations of elephants, wild water buffalo, and swamp deer. Kaziranga is recognized as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International for conservation of avifaunal species. Compared to other protected areas in India, Kaziranga has achieved notable success in wildlife conservation. Located on the edge of the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot, the park combines high species diversity and visibility.\n\nKaziranga is a vast expanse of tall elephant grass, marshland, and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests, crisscrossed by four major rivers, including the Brahmaputra, and the park includes numerous small bodies of water. Kaziranga has been the theme of several books, songs, and documentaries. The park celebrated its centennial in 2005 after its establishment in 1905 as a reserve forest.\n\nSource :- Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

But No Surrender, though an outlaw gang, at least has no known Nazi associations. And, according to the Dutch public prosecutor, joining a foreign fighting force isn\u2019t a crime in itself as long as nobody wages war on the Netherlands. \n\nThe prosecutor, however, reminded the bikers that rape and torture are still crimes, though he suggestively added that Iraq is very far away and crimes would be hard to prove.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

We're talking about wheat meat here...  not about Beelzebub :)  Today I make a Vegan seitan turkey recipe completely from scratch.\n\nThe secret ingredients:\n- vital wheat gluten\n- garbanzo bean flour.\n\nAlso known as:\nWheat meat (I like that one), Mock Duck, gluten meat, or just plain gluten.  It is a food made from the gluten of wheat.\n\nTexture: \nWhen you try it, you'll notice that Seitan is quite chewy, more like meat.  You know Tempeh?  Well tempeh can also be used to create mock meat, but the difference I find is that Tempeh is dryer than seitan, so seitan is good in dishes requiring more density such as mock turkey, beef, gravies.\n\nWhat about the calories in this vegan recipe?  according to a calorie counting website seitan has less calories than tempeh, but also less fibre.\n\n---\nI'm the EdgyVeg, a Vegan blogger who wants you to love what you eat regardless of your food preference!\n\nCheck out The Edgy Veg on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/edgyveg?ref=ts\nFollow @edgyveg on Twitter - https://twitter.com/#!/edgyveg\nVisit The Edgy Veg website here - http://www.theedgyveg.com\n\nMy channel is at Still Current Studios so please subscribe!", "title": "How to Make Seitan (Vegetarian Thanksgiving) | The Edgy Veg", "publishedDate": "2012-12-21T21:50:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJOIu4K7XpA", "description": "Stream the \"Pulses\" album FREE\nhttp://bit.ly/KarminAmzn\n\nBuy the \"Pulses\" album\nhttp://smarturl.it/pulses\n\nPlay #9DaysofPulses\nhttp://www.karminmusic.com\n\nSee us on tour!\nhttp://www.karminmusic.com/us/events\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n@karminmusic\n\nLike us on Facebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/karminbook", "title": "Behind The Songs (3 of 6) - \"Tidal Wave\" & \"Puppet\"", "publishedDate": "2014-03-21T17:54:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJOUjDmAVf0", "description": "Bulgaria Hotels - Plovdiv Hotels - Park Hotel Sankt Peterburg.\nOur Website: http://hotelpromotions.tv", "title": "Park Hotel Sankt Peterburg, Plovdiv, Bulgaria", "publishedDate": "2014-03-10T06:23:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJOg7G0NTvU", "description": "", "title": "weil ich ein m\u00e4dchen bin", "publishedDate": "2010-10-08T16:14:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJP4-28F2QU", "description": "ING DIRECT today announced the upcoming launch of THRiVE Chequing, an online, no-fee daily chequing account that will enable Canadians to deposit, withdraw or transfer money for free, all while earning interest.

There are also a range of genetic disorders that may cause red cells to be defective when they form or may inhibit sufficient production of red cells. Some diseases, such as Malaria specifically targets and destroys red blood cells. \n\nThe list of disorders affecting white cells is long and includes many different types of cancers of the lymphatic system. These are classified as Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphomas. Hodgkins lymphomas affect white cells in the lymphatic system. Non-Hodgkins lymphomas affect white cells found in the blood stream. And Leukemia affects immature white cells in the bone marrow. \n\nAlthough platelets are cell fragments rather than cells, they can be effected by a handful of disorders. Most of which are classified as Thrombocytopenias, which cause low platelet counts and impair the ability to stop bleeding. Essential thrombocytosis -- also known as primary thrombocythemia -- is a disorder characterized by the over production of platelets in the bone marrow, resulting in excessive clotting, bleeding, or both. \n\nMost plasma related disorders inlvolve the plasma's role in helping platelets in the clotting process. Hemophillia, for example is a deficiency of certain proteins that aid in the clotting process. Sepsis, is an illness that is triggered by an infection somewhere in the body that spreads into the blood, effecting the plasma and causing a whole-body inflammatory reaction.", "title": "Video 18 Blood and Immune System Disorders", "publishedDate": "2014-01-14T16:55:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJQNv8irhec", "description": "", "title": "Microeconomics: Choice in a World of Scarcity", "publishedDate": "2014-07-15T20:56:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJQcR6qLHgk", "description": "TAKEN FROM \"UNHOLY TOTAL HATE...FUCK YOU ALL\" CD.", "title": "HYMEN OF DARKNESS- \"COLD\"", "publishedDate": "2014-01-24T21:41:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJR-HCcm4YI", "description": "2014.03.23(SUN)\nDANCE@LIVE 2014 KOREA\nBREAK SIDE @ EZ Dance Studio, Gayang, Seoul\n\nStreetage Present (http://streetage.co.kr/)\n\n[MC]\nJERRY (Streetage / One Way Crew)\n\n[DJ]\nWRECKX (Rivers Crew)\n\n[JUDGES]\nDUCKY (Drifterz Crew / Floor Gangz / Korean Assassins)\nTAZO (Maximum Crew)\nWING (Jinjo Crew / 7 Commandoz / Redbull Allstars)\n\nWinner : RUSH\n\nNewest and freshest videos from the Korean b-boy scenes!

The dusky grouper is a protogynous hermaphrodite, which means it matures as a female (after around 5 years of age) but later develops into a male as it grows larger and older (9 - 16 years old). The dusky grouper lives a relatively solitary and sedentary life, except during the breeding season (June-September) when they form aggregations, usually in the ratios of 7 females to 1 male. Dominant males establish territories and demonstrate strong territorial behavior towards neighbouring males and smaller females. Diet consists of crustaceans, molluscs and fish.\nOver-fishing and spearfishing have caused a dramatic decline in the numbers of this species, leading to the banning of spearfishing of this species in France (1993).

The Hmong people originated from China.  For many century Hmong was ruling China but due so many wars the Chinese people took over all land and called it China.  The Hmong not only lost the war but all their written language, land,.  To survive all Hmong people spread across Asia.  Some went to India, North Vietnam, Burma, Thailand, Laos.Even though the Hmong people have no written history anywhere; stories were told mouth to mouth and cockfighting was one of them.  How the Hmong people fought their chicken was very interesting. Their cock was called \"qaib dib\" pronounced \"khai de\" and they took them to the forest for hunting with them.  They would use their cock to chant and call the wild rooster.  Once the wild rooster would come it would fight with the domestic cock.  Sometimes it will fight until death, but most of the time the Hmong man would use their bow to kill the wild rooster.  It has been said that many other groups of people have come to the Hmong and asked their chicken to be bred. One of the fairy tail is that a Hmong man has offered his best rooster to the King of Thai with the color of yellow with white tail, the one that the Thai people called today \"leung hang qhaou\" which is the King's chicken.  The Hmong chicken was very good fighting with their spurs and deadly kick.  That's how they were able to fight the wild rooster.  \n           For the Hmong who have left China most of them became nomad.  They became known as the montagnards or \"highland people\".  Watching a rooster fight has always been fascinating for all Hmong young boys.  For some of them who were too young to adventure into the forest and fight the rooster with the wild one, they would take their father rooster and go to the next village and try to fight the rooster with another one if they ever found one wondering in the garden or on the street.  They would throw the rooster to the other one and watched them fight until one gave up or until both of them could not fight anymore.   \n           Because the Hmong have lost their written language so there was no documents reporting Hmong as chickens fighters; but other stories such as the Hmong lords used to fight their rooster in dispute for their land instead of fighting wars with each other.  The Hmong believe that a rooster can kill the other rooster in one kick.  If asked what style or what kind of rooster they do like, most of their answer would be the one who can kill in one kick.  The Hmong adore their chickens and take care of them very carefully.  \n           In the late 1960's in Laos more and more Hmong were involved with the city so they were more exposed to the real game of cock fighting.  New to this field of game but so fascinated by, the Hmong became very active and developed their own breed, participate and compete with the Lao and Thai.  However the Thai chickens remain the best of all time but the Hmong quickly imported Thai breed and they have become one of the toughest opponents for the other entire breed.  \n           Now for the Hmong who live in the United States they are the most active in cockfighting compare to all other ethnic group coming from Asia.  However they do not like cockfighting with knives, needles or other weapons. They feel that it's too cruel and there are no art or skill in that at all.  They love their chicken and they hate to see their rooster be beaten or kick all the times.  If they see their rooster get hurt too much they would stopped the fight and surrender even though the rooster came from a very good blood line and would not give up or collapse.  Today they are having activities all across America with all new breeds especially crossbreed.", "title": "2 vs 1 Thai Rooster Shamo Aseel", "publishedDate": "2014-08-21T01:48:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJhJ8k7THUU", "description": "\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0420\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0448\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c \u0412\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430", "title": "Russian Martial Art.

ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\n\n[FULL VIDEO TITLE] \nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "UVA's Nathan Kirby No-Hitter vs Pittsburgh | ACC Must See Moment of the Year Candidate", "publishedDate": "2014-05-25T22:22:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJlskA02z6Q", "description": "", "title": "Delcamp D02; Lesson 4: Scale of E minor with crescendo and decrescendo", "publishedDate": "2014-03-31T15:21:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJlwheuXq3o", "description": "", "title": "FENLAND 25th April", "publishedDate": "2010-05-01T06:12:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJm63WaLVrw", "description": "Jon Sharratt displays his 1951 Humber Sport at the eleventh annual All British Cycling Event on September 19, 2010 held at held at Barley John's Brew Pub in New Brighton, Minnesota.

This is Sterling with Alarm Grid and today we have a question from Eric in California. Eric wants to know how to set his duress code for his L5100 LYNX Touch Wireless Alarm Control Panel. For those of you that don't know, the duress code is a special emergency code, 4 digit user code, that when entered, it will send a silent panic alarm to the central station.\n\nBasically, it's used for the instances of the home invasion where the criminal approaches you while you're entering your home. Worse case scenario, we hope none of you ever run into this kind of thing. But, a guy comes up, puts a gun in your back and says, \"You better turn this system off. No funny stuff, or else.\"\n\nWhat the duress code is, you enter the code, to the criminal it looks like you're just simply disarming. The panel goes silent because obviously an audible alarm would defeat the whole purpose. The panel goes silent, sends a message to the alarm that a duress code was used to enter, they know not to call the house because again that would alert the intruder to something going on. They don't do anything other than call the police.\n\nNext thing you know, the police are there and hopefully it works out. Again, hopefully we never need to use this, but it's always good to protect yourself and protect your family, so I'm going to walk you through how to set your duress code.\n\nWhat we want to do, from the Home screen, want to press More, bottom right. Want to click on Tools, we want to enter our master code. In a previous video we had set our master code to 5-6-2-0, and enter that, which gets us to our user screen. We're going to click the User icon in the top left.\n\nAnd you notice here it says, Master, Babysitter and Duress. We're going to click on Duress. You click Edit, bottom left. Then show Duress is user code 16, the final user code. It's not really a user, because you only want to be doing this when you're disarming. You don't even want to use it to arm. It's only when you're disarming in one of these emergency situations.\n\nSo, you click User Code and you now have your screen here. I always recommend doing something that you'll remember. On the old key pad style alarms we used to recommend doing 1-7-9-3 or 2-5-8-0, something that would be, even in the high stress situation, we'll remember it, the four keys around or straight down the middle.\n\nSince this one is a touch screen key pad, it's not so important to do that, but maybe for general reasons, it's probably still good to just keep it simple. So, 2-5-8-0, done. We now have Duress [learned] in. You've got to click Save. And now on our screen you see that asterisk is showing that Duress has been set up with a code. Before we didn't have one and so it didn't show.\n\nIf we back out, back to here, we can arm the system. And if we waited the 60 second exit delay and then did a disarm and we entered the duress, it shows that the system is fully disarmed as if it was a normal disarm. However, if this was hooked up to a central station, the police will be on their way.\n\nSo, once again, I hope you guys never have to use it. But it's always good to know how. So, hopefully that answered the question. If you guys have any more questions, submit them to FAQ@alarmgrid.com. We'll get them answered for you. We'll either link to it on the website or we'll make one of these nice videos for you.", "title": "Eric in California asks How to set his duress code on a Honeywell L5100 control panel", "publishedDate": "2012-12-24T03:01:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJpEHH9VHIc", "description": "http://www.celebified.com - Get the hottest scoop on your favorite stars, TV shows, movies, and more!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Celebified - 'Like' us and join in on the gossip fest!\nhttp://www.twitter.com/Celebified - Follow us for regular entertainment buzz and behind-the-scenes snaps from our red carpet visits, exclusive interviews, and more!\n\nThe X Factor Season 2 Runner-Up Carly Rose Sonenclar on Her Soulful New Album, NSYNC's VMAs Reunion, & Celebrity Crushes\n\nCelebified and Wetpaint caught up with The X Factor's season 2 runner-up Carly Rose Sonenclar on the 2013 MTV VMAs red carpet!

They also disguise such sensitization campaigns, (that are plausibly deniable), to make their targets seem like they're suffering from delusions and paranoia when the target reacts, or talks about it to friends and family, because these harassment campaigns are designed to seem just so ridiculous and impossible to be orchestrated from a non-sensitized person's point of view. With these sensitizations, they torture innocent law abiding targeted individuals and rob them of their basic human right to live their lives in peace and normalcy. Their objective is to harass, suppress, scam, intimidate, control, bully, manipulate, dehumanize, and ultimately destroy their victims overtime for kicks thru their highly covert well funded and well organized syndicated mind control sick demonic psychotic delusional agenda. They also want to send a clear message to their target that they are constantly being watched everywhere they go, while advertising their ownership of the community. These criminal activities can go on round the clock 24/7 for many years undetected by the average non victim citizen, because their sensitizing agents are disguised as everyday normal things. These harassments are just a coverup front for a more sinister agenda, which is: PSYOP, Mind Control, neurological, non-lethal military weaponry, human behavior studies, and psychic research. Only a TI (targeted individual) will experience such orchestrated nonstop harassment, because the TI is relentlessly and systematically subjected to a bombardment of a repetitive sensitizing agent everywhere a TI may go. These normal everyday things are exaggerated and amplified in frequency for the TI alone, such as: car horns, coughs, keys jiggling, red colors, water bottles, the name \"John\", etc.  This is a premeditated and calculated evil act that causes paranoia, mental distress, and anxiety to innocent human lives overtime. It can even lead to suicide, murder, insanity, health deterioration, or even death. This is a violation of our basic human rights and needs to be exposed for the whole world to see.

Webb\nScreenwriter: Andrew Bergman, Gregory McDonald\nFilm Description: Chevy Chase added a classic comic hero to the film landscape with Fletch, one of his few truly popular star vehicles in a famously misguided post-Saturday Night Live career. Chase plays Irwin M. Fletcher, known to everyone as Fletch, a Los Angeles Lakers-loving investigative reporter with a gleeful disdain for deadlines and a knack for pushing the buttons of his frustrated editor (Richard Libertini). He's also known for donning numerous disguises and assuming zany false identities to help gain information. While pursuing an ongoing story about a powerful drug dealer who operates from Venice Beach, he comes across an intriguing offshoot in which he becomes intimately involved. Aviation executive Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson) has an unusual proposition for Fletch: If Fletch agrees to an elaborate plan to kill him, for reasons Stanwyk refuses to divulge beyond explaining that he has bone cancer, Fletch will walk away with a healthy sum of money and a plane ticket to Brazil. Curious yet suspicious by profession, Fletch begins investigating Stanwyk's true motives, which leads him through numerous misadventures. Among them are a visit to a stuffy country club; a high-speed car chase with an unwitting passenger; repeat encounters with Stanwyk's wife (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), although she may not be his only one; and a trip to Provo -- that's Utah, not Spain. Inspired by a novel of the same name by Gregory McDonald, Fletch went from thriller to comedy as it was adapted into a vehicle for Chase.\n\nfletch,\"fletch clip\",fletcher,\"fletcher cox\",\"fletcher henderson\",\"fletching guide 1-99 fast\",\"fletch lives\",\"fletch theme\",\"fletching guide\",\"fletcher memorial home\",\"chevy chase\",\"terrence evans\",\"michael ritchie\",\"cigarette videos\",\"mattress videos\",\"rifle videos\",\"shotgun videos\",comedy,\"cult comedies\",mystery,\"gordon a webb\",\"alan greisman\",\"deception videos\",\"house videos\",\"irwin fletch fletcher\",\"man with shotgun\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++17781,/m/0p_jc,/m/0cp80q", "title": "Fletch (10/10) Movie CLIP - Mattress Police (1985) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T14:08:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJuQE6-2JrM", "description": "Streak Free Window Cleaner\nhttp://www.chemicalguys.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=CLD_677_16&Click=18676&utm_source=Social&utm_medium=YouTube&utm_campaign=CLD_677_16\n\nWindow Magic, Streak-Free, Tint Safe Window Cleaner.

Amongst many other black projects, a team of British scientists working at an Infinitum Research experimental station stumbled across some remarkable phenomena involving DNA manipulation. This led to deeper research with dangerously unpredictable results, often leading to human patients losing their lives in irresponsible and immoral experiments.\n\nTime passed on, and by the mid 1990s the failure rate of the experiments had been reduced from 75% to a mere 15%, enough for Infinitum to move onto the next stage: Biological Light Refraction. The British team were hoping to unravel the possibilities of light manipulation to create the perfect covert military agent. Early into the new millennium, due to a gross miscalculation, a series of tests on Subject 617 led to a massive synaptic trauma leaving the patient with multiple genetic anomalies.\n\nThe subject was left in constant pain and with unstable DNA. The subject escaped captivity, killing anyone that got in its way. The I.R.I.S. (Infinitum Research Interception Squad) team have been deployed to return the subject to a maximum security Infinitum Research facility for further study and dissection. The entire project was considered a failure: all funding ceased and development was discontinued while all records and traces of the experiments were destroyed. Infinitum Research denies all knowledge of any form of human DNA manipulation but are more than happy to comment on the possibilities of cloning human organs inside suitable animal donors. It is believed that these organ cloning experiments form the main cover for their human genetic manipulation experimentations.\n\nSubject 617, known as 'The Hidden', must turn the tables and become the hunter instead of the hunted as the I.R.I.S. team close their net around him.\"\n\nGassy: http://www.youtube.com/user/GassyMexican\nDiction: http://www.youtube.com/user/EatMyDiction1\nJuicetra: http://www.youtube.com/user/Juicetra\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/SeaNanners\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/SeaNannersPage\nTumblr: http://www.seananners.tumblr.com", "title": "HUNTED BY MARIO (The Hidden)", "publishedDate": "2013-03-29T16:00:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJvIo-mUd_I", "description": "Take a look at the Chanterelle mushrooms we picked", "title": "Mushroom hunting: Chanterelle part 3", "publishedDate": "2008-09-10T06:26:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJvLIpIlasA", "description": "\u0e01\u0e25\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07 sonic boom \u0e43\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27", "title": "All New by Jeep Tune Up", "publishedDate": "2012-05-24T10:17:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "AJvq83oyxw8", "description": "Buy this Release: http://troubleandbass.com/artist/distal/vampire-lightning-ep\n\nAt long last, Trouble & Bass is thrilled to release this four-track salvo from Distal, the Boss of the South.

This gets backed up by \"Cherry Red,\" a track as cool as the paint on your tricked-out Cadillac.

This doctrine is a central tenet of the Indian religions. It is also a common belief of other religions such as Druidism, Spiritism, Theosophy, and Eckankar and is found in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as Siberia, West Africa, North America, and Australia.\nAlthough the majority of sects within the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of Kabbalah, the Cathars[citation needed], the Druze[ and the Rosicrucians. The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of Neoplatonism, Orphism, Hermeticism, Manicheanism and Gnosticism of the Roman era, as well as the Indian religions has been the subject of recent scholarly research.\nIn recent decades, many Europeans and North Americans have developed an interest in reincarnation. Contemporary films, books, and popular songs frequently mention reincarnation. In the last decades, academic researchers have begun to explore reincarnation and published reports of children's memories of earlier lives in peer-reviewed journals and books.\n \nConceptual definitions:\nTemple door depicting Dashavatar-the ten avatars, Sree Balaji Temple, Goa. (from leftmost upper corner, clock wise) Matsya, Narasimha, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Kalki, Vamana, Balarama, Varaha and Kurma.\nThe word \"reincarnation\" derives from Latin, literally meaning, \"entering the flesh again\". The Greek equivalent metempsychosis (\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03c8\u03cd\u03c7\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) roughly corresponds to the common English phrase \"transmigration of the soul\" and also usually connotes reincarnation after death, as either human, animal, though emphasising the continuity of the soul, not the flesh. The term has been used by modern philosophers such as Kurt G\u00f6del[ and has entered the English language. Another Greek term sometimes used synonymously is palingenesis, \"being born again\". \n\nMusic credit to:\nKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\".\nLicensed under Creative Commons \n\"Attribution 3.0\" \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n\nLicence for Images in video:\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License\nThis file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.", "title": "Reincarnation - What is Reincarnation", "publishedDate": "2013-09-14T20:23:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "AK6DD-lRVg8", "description": "Children's super group, The Wiggles, has defended its treatment of Sam Moran, who was let go as the Yellow Wiggle.

She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect, which represents consciousness or discrimination, remains impotent and void. Goddess worship is an integral part of Hinduism.\nDevi is, quintessentially, the core form of every Hindu Goddess. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord, she is also called Prakriti, as she balances out the male aspect of the divine addressed Purusha.[2]\nDevi is the supreme Being in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, while in the Smartha tradition, she is one of the five primary forms of God.[3][4] In other Hindu traditions of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, Devi embodies the active energy and power of male deities (Purushas), such as Vishnu in Vaishnavism or Shiva in Shaivism. Vishnu's shakti counterpart is called Lakshmi, with Parvati being the female shakti of Shiva.\nDurga:  In the Hindu pantheon, Durga is one of the most popular goddesses, and her creation takes place in the context of a cosmic crisis. The asuras were on the ascent, and they had become a threat to cosmic stability. The male gods were unable to contain and subdue them. A number of male gods having failed to subdue the demons led by Mahishasura, assembled into a conclave and emitted their energies together which took the form of the warrior goddess, Durga, that is, the invincible.Saraswati::She is the goddess of speech and learning, and is the creator of Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas. She is the consort of Brahma, the creator and member of the Hindu Trinity. She is equally revered by Hindus, Jains and the Buddhists. Her iconography depicts her association with art, science and culture, which is dramatically different from some other major goddesses who are identified with fertility, wealth, and battles. She is shown as having four arms, and the most common items held by her in her hands are a book, a vina (lute), a mala, and a water pot. The book signified art, science and learning; the vina associates her with music and performing arts; and the prayer beads and water pot signify her association with religious rites. She is worshipped on the fifth day of the spring according to Hindu calendar, called the Basant Panchami.Shri-Lakshmi:...Shri, commonly known as Lakshmi and also called Shri Lakshmi, is one of the most popular and widely worshipped Devi in Hindu tradition since pre-Buddhist period. Her name is the basis for \"Lady Luck (Lakshmi)\" in the Christian West[citation needed]and her form of rising from water is depicted as Venus. She has a considerable body of mythology and history. The earliest legend states that Shri is born as a result of austerities of Prajapati, and she represents ten qualities and objects, namely, food, royal power, universal sovereignty, knowledge, power, holy luster, kingdom, fortune, bounteousness, and beauty.Kali:....Kali is one of the most significant divinities, and many texts and contexts treat Kali as an independent deity, not directly associated with a male god. In case she is associated with a male god, it is invariably Shiva. In this aspect, she represents the omnipotent Shakti of Shiva. She holds both the creative and destructive power of time.Navadurga::...Navadurga (Devanagari: \u0928\u0935\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e), which literally means nine Durgas, constitute, according to Hindu mythology, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. Navadurga are famously worshipped during the Autumn Navaratri or the Nine days, initiating the devotees into a period of festivities according to Hindu calendar.Mahavidya ::;...Mahavidyas, that is, the supreme knowledge, revelations and manifestations, refer to a group of ten goddesses. They constitute an important aspect of Mahadevi theology, which emphasizes that the Devi has a tendency to manifest and display herself in a variety of forms and aspects.Ten Mahavidyas are: Kali, Tara, Chinnamasta, Bhuvanesvari, Bagla, Dhumavati, Kamla, Matangi, Sodasi, and Bhairavi.\nParvati:...Parvati is the daughter of the mountains (the Himalayas), and manifests the aspect of the goddess as the wife of Shiva. She is generally considered a benign goddess. She is one of the principal deities of Shaktism and sometimes considered the essence of Shakti herself, i.e. Adi-shakti .arms, but when alone, she is shown having four arms, and riding a tiger or lion. She is also known by a number of other names, including Durga (Goddess Beyond reach)Ambika (mother), Gauri (golden), Shyama (dark complexioned), Bhavani (Mother of Universe) Bhairavi (awesome) and Kali (black-colored or Goddess of Time). She is also identified as Mahadevi.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi", "title": "Pandal Decoration Showing Snow Covered Mountain", "publishedDate": "2013-10-26T16:47:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "AKKMR5WX6Wk", "description": "Siemens showed off a new set of connected appliances at IFA 2013 in Berlin, and we got to chat with Dr. Claudia H\u00e4pp about what these connectivity options may actually do for consumers.", "title": "Siemens Appliance Connectivity", "publishedDate": "2013-09-07T23:33:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "AKKqLl_ZEEY", "description": "\u00a9 2006 WMG\nStand (Video)\n\nGet Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage: 1982- 2011, the definitive R.E.M. greatest hits collection coming 11/15/2011!\nAmazon: http://amzn.to/vBDlg5 iTunes: http://glnk.it/k8", "title": "R.E.M. - Stand (Video)", "publishedDate": "2009-10-27T02:21:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "AKKr9ocUvgs", "description": "Gran victoria de Barcelona SC para mantener la punta", "title": "Barcelona SC 1 vs El Nacional 0 - Gol del \"Chivo\" Suarez \u25ba Campeonato Ecuatoriano 2014.10.26", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T00:16:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "AKL7I--1M6U", "description": "The Power of Fate.

By 1937 the group consisted of Williams (lead tenor), Eddie Jackson (second tenor), Ira Williams (baritone), Howard Daniel (bass) and James Sherman (piano). They recorded mostly negro spirituals for the Vocalion label until they signed with Columbia in 1940. Columbia wanted to remake the group into a pop rival to Decca's Ink Spots. Soon the Charioteers were in the pop music charts with their recording of Russ Morgan's 1940 song \"So Long.\" Although they never achieved the phenomenal success of the Ink Spots, the Charioteers' gospel-pop sound did produce a total of 7 hits of their own in the 1940s and two more in support of other artists. \n\nThe Charioteers became regulars on Bing Crosby's Kraft Music Hall during the fall 1942 season. They stayed with Bing on the radio throughout most of the next 5 years, including the first season of the Philco show. Although the Charioteers did not commercially record with Bing (they were under contract to different record companies), they did record with other top vocalists, and produced two top 30 hits with Sinatra (\"Don't Forget Tomorrow Night\") and Buddy Clark (\"Now is the Hour\"). Their seven solo hits include \"So Long\" (1940), \"On the Boardwalk in Atlantic City\" (1946), \"Open the Door Richard\" (1947), \"Chi-Baba\" (1947), \"What Did He Say?\" (1948), \"Look-A-There Ain't She Pretty\" (1948), and \"A Kiss and a Rose\" (1949). During this same period the Ink Spots produced more than 3 dozen top 30 hits. \n\nIn 1950 Billy Williams was asked to form a group to perform regularly on TV in Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows. The TV producers thought the Charioteers were too old. So Williams left the Charioteers and formed The Billy Williams Quartet. The Charioteers sans Williams continued to perform throughout most of the 1950s but without their previous chart success. The group disbanded in 1957. Williams eventually became a solo artist and was the first in-person guest on American Bandstand. Williams died in Chicago on Oct. 17, 1972.", "title": "Charioteers--You Turned The Tables On Me", "publishedDate": "2008-04-24T17:04:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "AKM-i8LnUdQ", "description": "Here's a link to Kat Scrappiness: http://shop.katscrappiness.com/\n\nRemember Kat offers free shipping for orders over $35 and there is a coupon code right now. \n\nUse EASTER10 to get 10% off your order!\n\nThanks for watching!", "title": "Kat Scrappiness Design Team Goodies for April!!", "publishedDate": "2012-03-31T20:28:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "AKM3kG3somk", "description": "Millions - Citrus.", "title": "Millions - Citrus", "publishedDate": "2011-08-03T01:56:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "AKM7fmLnypU", "description": "This use to be one of my favorite movies as a kid, but when I wanted to look for the video, I could only find Tim curry singing it and someone who recorded the scene using only a digital camera.

With around 10,000 living species, they are the most speciose class of tetrapod vertebrates. All present species belong to the subclass Neornithes, and inhabit ecosystems across the globe, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Extant birds range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) Bee Hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) Ostrich. The fossil record indicates that birds emerged within theropod dinosaurs during the Jurassic period, around 160 million years (Ma) ago. Paleontologists regard birds as the only clade of dinosaurs to have survived the Cretaceous--Paleogene extinction event 65.5 Ma (million years) ago.\nModern birds are characterised by feathers, a beak with no teeth, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. All living species of birds have wings- the most recent species without wings was the moa, which is generally considered to have become extinct in the 1500s. Wings are evolved forelimbs, and most bird species can fly. Flightless birds include ratites, penguins, and a number of diverse endemic island species. Birds also have unique digestive and respiratory systems that are highly adapted for flight. Some birds, especially corvids and parrots, are among the most intelligent animal species; a number of bird species have been observed manufacturing and using tools, and many social species exhibit cultural transmission of knowledge across generations.\nMany species undertake long distance annual migrations, and many more perform shorter irregular movements. Birds are social; they communicate using visual signals and through calls and songs, and participate in social behaviours, including cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have polygynous (\"many females\") or, rarely, polyandrous (\"many males\") breeding systems. Eggs are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.\nMany species are of economic importance, mostly as sources of food acquired through hunting or farming. Some species, particularly songbirds and parrots, are popular as pets. Other uses include the harvesting of guano (droppings) for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure prominently in all aspects of human culture from religion to poetry to popular music. About 120--130 species have become extinct as a result of human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Currently about 1,200 species of birds are threatened with extinction by human activities, though efforts are underway to protect them.Birds' diets are varied and often include nectar, fruit, plants, seeds, carrion, and various small animals, including other birds. Because birds have no teeth, their digestive system is adapted to process unmasticated food items that are swallowed whole.\nBirds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders.

There is also a fishkeeping industry, as a branch of agriculture.\nFreshwater fishkeeping is by far the most popular branch of the hobby, with even small pet stores often selling a variety of freshwater fish, such as goldfish, guppies, and angelfish. While most freshwater aquaria are set up as community tanks containing a variety of peaceful species, single-species breeding aquaria are also popular. Livebearing fish such as mollies and guppies are among the species that are most easily raised in captivity, but aquarists also regularly breed numerous other species, including many types of cichlid, catfish, characin, and killifish.\nMany fishkeepers create freshwater aquascapes where the focus is on aquatic plants as well as on the fish. These aquariums include the \"Dutch Aquarium\", in reference to the pioneering work carried out by European aquarists in designing these sorts of tanks. In recent years, one of the most active advocates of the heavily planted aquarium is the Japanese aquarist Takashi Amano.\nGarden ponds are in some ways similar to freshwater aquaria, but are usually much larger and exposed to the ambient climatic conditions. In the tropics, tropical fish can be kept in garden ponds, but in the cooler regions temperate zone species such as goldfish, koi, and orfe are kept instead.\nFish have been raised as food in pools and ponds for thousands of years. Brightly colored or tame specimens of fish in these pools have sometimes been valued as pets rather than food. Many other cultures kept fish for both functional and decorative purposes.\nAncient Sumerians were known to keep wild-caught fish in ponds, before preparing them for meals. Depictions of the sacred fish of Oxyrhynchus kept in captivity in rectangular temple pools have been found in ancient Egyptian art.\nSimilarly, throughout Asia has experienced a long history of stocking rice paddies with freshwater fish suitable for eating, including various types of catfish and cyprinid. Selective breeding of carp into today's popular and completely domesticated koi and goldfish is believed to have begun over 2,000 years ago in Japan and China, respectively. The Chinese brought goldfish indoors during the Song Dynasty to enjoy them in large ceramic vessels.\nIn Medieval Europe, carp pools were a standard feature of estates and monasteries, providing an alternative to meat on feast days when meat could not be eaten for religious reasons.\nMarine fish have been similarly valued for centuries. Wealthy Romans kept lampreys and other fish in salt water pools. Tertullian reports that Asinius Celer paid 8000 sesterces for a particularly fine mullet. Cicero reports that the advocate Quintus Hortensius wept when a favored specimen died, while Rather cynically, he referred to these ancient fishkeepers as the Piscinarii, the \"fish-pond owners\" or \"fish breeders\", for example when saying that ...the rich (I mean your friends the fish-breeders) did not disguise their jealousy of me.", "title": "My aquarium", "publishedDate": "2010-11-07T18:23:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "AKUbprLEhX8", "description": "Product Page: http://www.harborfreight.com/18-gauge-sheet-metal-shear-92148.html\n\nMake smooth clean cuts through sheet metal, aluminum and plastic as thick as 18 gauge.

Both are related to the Indohyus (an extinct semi-aquatic deer-like ungulate) from which they split around 54 million years ago.[6][7] Primitive whales probably first took to the sea about 50 million years ago and became fully aquatic about 5-10 million years later.[8]\n\nGenesis 1:21 \"And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.\" \n\nAccording to evolution, life began in the sea. However, because the land was better for life, evolution developed land life from sea life. It was on land that mammals evolved, according to evolution. Here, though, evolution has painted itself into a corner. Or perhaps it is better to say that evolutionists have fallen into one of the traps set for them by the Creator. You see, the largest creatures on Earth live in the sea -- and they are mammals!\n\nThe great whales are mammals like many land animals. However, it is very clear that they never lived on land -- nor do they resemble any land creature. Whales provide clear evidence that, contrary to evolution's claims, not even all mammals are related to each other. And if mammals are so different that they cannot be related to each other through evolution, neither is it likely that bugs and trees and cows and humans could be related by evolution. As Genesis so clearly tells us, living things were originally made in distinct kinds, and they continue to reproduce after their kinds.\n\nOne wants to ask the evolutionist, if the drive to live on land was so great it moved sea creatures to become land creatures, why did some mammals go to all the trouble to move back into the sea? To say the least, whales offer Bible-believing Christians a great testimony to our Creator and a good argument against evolution.

These photographs were taken in 2005 of a sweatshop I toured in Bangalore while I was there.  If you're expecting to see a dark cramped room with poor lighting and managers with whips, you're probably going to be disappointed.  On first glance it appears airy and well lit and almost decent.  But with very little probing you notice there's no ventilation, no bathrooms, no water fountains, no sinks, and then you learn they can't leave their station to go to the bathroom, they are yelled at and hit by managers if they talk, there's no food, they work 10 hour days 6 days a week, and for all that they are paid no more than 5 dollars a day.  They are paid once a month on a Saturday.  Why Saturday you ask?  So if the female workers have a husband that's a drunk, that'll beat them and take their salary, they have Sunday to recuperate and not miss work on Monday.\n\nFor more information, please check out these links: http://www.ilo.org and http://laborrights.org\n\nWE NEED LEGISLATION THAT HOLDS AMERICAN COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE WORK CONDITIONS THEY FOSTER ABROAD.

The body shape is a cutaway-modified Grand Concert style, and its lower-bout bridge position makes for richer, more resonant low end than is customary for a small-body acoustic. Finally, it's great for nuanced playing, plus it has an 'old-world' quality about it thanks to its slot headstock.\n\nIn zZounds.com's exclusive overview of the Taylor 12-Fret guitar series, Grammy-winning guitarist Wayne Johnson talks about how he likes 12-Fret series guitars because he can play delicate passages and still get plenty of volume and tonal balance.\n\nTo view our complete line of Taylor products, please visit http://www.zzounds.com/cat--Taylor--3795\n\nAbout zZounds.com:\nzZounds.com\u00a0was founded in 1996 to provide musicians with the best online buying experience for guitars, basses, recording, microphones, keyboards, DJ, and other musical instruments.

The car's name was Romulus, a British E.R.A. painted in the blue and yellow colours of what was then known as Siam. The driver was Prince Bira.\nThis fascinating film portrays the story of how two Siamese princes, Prince Bira and his cousin and manager Prince Chula, established the White Mouse team and took on the top racing drivers of the 1930s. Bira won the BRDC Gold Star three years in succession and Siam's name became well known in a world predominantly monopolised by European drivers.\nOne dream remained, to race Romulus in front of their home crowd. In 1939, Chula had finalised plans for the Bangkok Grand Prix when the intervention of World War II cancelled the event.\nFifty years later, Prince Chula's daughter Narisa Chakrabongse fulfilled her father's dream. Fifteen historic racing cars were assembled for the Bangkok Historic Grand Prix, a two-part event held on the original intended circuit through the streets of Bangkok and at the modern Pattaya International circuit.\nAs well as assembling Romulus and five other ex-Bira cars, Narisa also invited no less than five Bugattis, two MGs and a BMW. Eight cars came from the UK, six from Australia and one from the USA. Romulus, regarded as a legend by the Thai people, led the cars in a demonstration run both at Bangkok and Pattaya, driven by Narisa.\nRodney Felton's powerful Alfa recorded the fastest time in Bangkok, but on the twisty Pattaya circuit some delightful surprises took place!\nInclude rare high quality pre-war colour and black &amp; white footage from Narisa Chakrabongse's archives.\nThis is almost 60 glorious minutes of motor racing history.", "title": "Romulus Returns to Siam", "publishedDate": "2009-01-21T15:30:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "AKxqLtjvzJ4", "description": "Watch the ENTIRE season #1 of my TV show on Hulu:\nhttp://hulu.com/annoying-orange\n\nHEY!

Finding the lyrics was even more difficult, but thanks to someone called Rich-Joy, I got them and the following information about the song. The author, Ted Edwards, who was brought up in the coal mining community of Wigan, used to lie in bed as a small child and listen to all these early morning sounds around him, as the local community of miners prepared for and set off for work in the mine. He would then imagine the miners in their clogs as a cavalry charge, off to remove the Indians who'd taken over the mine during the night!!!\nAn interesting social note: they did not have alarm clocks in those days, so the mine employed a man to go round shortly before the shift was due to start to knock on bedroom windows using a long pole to wake up any miners who might have overslept. His were the first clogs to be heard in the morning, shortly to be followed by an increasing number as the miners left home for the mine.", "title": "Guitar: Coal-Hole Cavalry", "publishedDate": "2009-07-06T11:37:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "AL3pTFjmGlc", "description": "It very well could be completely wrong.

Digital darling, Burberry, who nabs the top spot for the second straight year, posted e-commerce sales increases of 59 percent in Europe and 30 percent in the U.S. First-time genius Tory Burch saw its e-commerce business grow 90 percent.\n\nHowever, many of fashion's brands have been caught flat-footed. One in five fashion brands in this year's Index still do not sell online in the U.S. Less than half, only 48 percent, have launched e-commerce in the U.K., and only 1/3 sell online across Western Europe.\n\nM-commerce, in-store checkout, and smartphones are also proving disruptive forces in fashion. Almost a quarter of searches for fashion brands now occur from mobile devices, and the iPad may prove transformative for fashion brands. The device registers twice the conversion rate of desktop or laptop computers and 20 times that of smartphones.\n\nIn social media, the glow of the prospect of establishing a direct relationship with the consumer has not lost its luster. It's no surprise that a creatively driven industry has embraced Pinterest and Instagram, both highly visual platforms. More fashion brands have an official presence on these emerging platforms than sell online.\n\nIn addition, industry icons Prada and Hermes find themselves in the Challenged class for the second straight year, buttressing the notion that brand equity and resources lie fallow unless there is leadership and commitment to the medium.\n\nFinally, the industry's largest conglomerates have failed to leverage the advantages of scale. The average digital IQ for every multi-brand fashion house, with the exception of PPR, dropped significantly from our 2010 index. \n\nThis is in contrast to other sectors where firms ranging from Starwood and Estee Lauder to L'Oreal and VF Corp are leveraging back end operations and elevating key personnel to enterprise wide roles in e-commerce and digital.\n\nIn our fourth annual Digital IQ Index: Fashion, we maintain our original thesis that digital competence is linked to shareholder value in the prestige industry. This study attempts to quantify the digital competence of 64 fashion brands. \n\nOur aim is to provide a robust tool to diagnose digital strengths and weaknesses and help brands achieve greater return on incremental investment.\n\nMembers can download the full report at L2ThinkTank.com.", "title": "Digital IQ Index\u00ae: Fashion 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-10-04T19:48:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "AL6fnUR3Akg", "description": "No te pierdas \"El Limpiapiscinas en Vivo\", streamings semanales a partir del Jueves 10 de Febrero a las 19:00 hrs con Denise Rosenthal y todo el elenco de la pel\u00edcula \"El Limpiapiscinas\".\n\nDirecci\u00f3n: Francesc Morales y Sebasti\u00e1n Badilla\nProducci\u00f3n: Gonzalo Badilla y Sebasti\u00e1n Badilla\nGui\u00f3n: Los Contenidos\n\nwww.limpiapiscinas.cl\n\n2011 Bufonada Producciones.", "title": "Nicole Ivanov (Denise Rosenthal) lava auto", "publishedDate": "2011-02-02T00:14:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "AL6gNj28zJc", "description": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2146199819/commodore-amiga-a-visual-commpendium\n\nEvery now and then we post something that isnt a longplay, like this interesting project about an Amiga book that contains many of the games we have longplayed! \n\nPlease support this Kickstarter :)\nWe might do this more often if there are other interesting indie projects :)", "title": "Kickstarter Retro Book Project - Commodore Amiga: a visual Commpendium", "publishedDate": "2014-10-31T23:04:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "AL7JXFl2buM", "description": "Marquette High School finishes third place at Missouri High School Cheerleading Championships", "title": "Marquette State Cheer Routine 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-10-03T02:56:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "AL7dwNNP0T0", "description": "Hello!

It was produced using Stratasys FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling\u00ae) technology. \n\nThe engines design was created using Autodesk Inventor 2010 mechanical design and engineering software, and it was produced on both Fortus 3D Production Systems and Dimension 3D Printers from Stratasys. The engine model sets a new precedence in scale, and it showcases the potential of 3D printing.\nOur Inventor software with FDM technology takes design innovation to an entirely new level of sophistication, says Autodesks Gonzalo Martinez, office of the CTO. Today at Autodesk University weve shown that with FDM, you can create realistic 3D models of nearly any design. We believe that Stratasys FDM technology is the future of 3D printing and production.\n\nThe engines gear box includes two sets of gears, which operate two sets of propellers that move in counter rotation to each other. With an engine length of over 10 feet, a blade-span of 10.5 feet, and 188 components, the engine model is massive in size. It includes several large parts, such as six propeller blades, each measuring 4.5 feet.\n\nThe turbo-prop engine was designed by Nino Caldarola, a freelance designer for Autodesk. He shared his concept with Autodesk who wanted to bring a full-scale model to life using Inventor software and FDM technology. Caldarolas design is a hybrid of newer engine and classic engine design and was partially inspired by the Piaggio Avanti II aircraft engine, the TP 500. Caldarola worked with engineers at RedEye On Demand prototyping and production service, a business unit of Stratasys, to make adjustments that would ensure an accurate physical model. \n\n97% Cost Reduction;  83% Time Reduction\nAll 188 components were produced in 4 weeks and assembled in 2.5 weeks for a total production time of 6.5 weeks. Using conventional fabrication processes, such as machining and casting (with in-house and outside resources) a manufacturer would expect to spend 9 months or more producing a model like this. Using the FDM process in-house, a manufacturer could expect costs of roughly $25,000, versus an estimated $800,000 to $1 million for conventional processes. These numbers represent about a 97% reduction in production costs and 83% reduction in production time.\nIt was spectacular seeing my computer design brought to life with a 3D model, says Caldarola. I worked under a tight timeline and across geographies with both Stratasys and Autodesk, and I am very proud of the collaborative process and result. Just a few years ago, a project of this scale would have never been attempted. \n\nThis project shows that 3D printing has made the progression to large format, says Stratasys CEO, Scott Crump. Hopefully this project will help make manufacturers aware that a designer can conceive and design a product this significant, and then have it physically modeled in about 6 weeks.\n \nStratasys and Fused Deposition Modeling are registered trademarks, and Fortus and RedEye are trademarks of Stratasys, Inc.

Tonguing a note is essentially starting a note with the tongue on the reed, giving it a beginning really. Your obvious way is to block the air flow and then start the airflow with your tongue.  When playing scales not staccato but articulated, it's important to keep the air flow constant, so the tongue now starts and stops the reed, not the air flow. Just from under here, like that. You should hear the airflow still continue. You hear the air continuing and the note starting and stopping. \n\nAnother way of tonguing is very staccato where you're actually stopping and starting the airflow.  There's another tonguing technique called slap tongue, which is almost another way of articulating is very staccato where you're actually blocking the airflow and starting the note with a heavy attack. You hear no airflow in between there. That's generally called something like staccato.\n\nAnother tonguing technique is slap tonguing, which is the feeling of smacking out a low note but not following through with the air. It's kind of a tricky technique, but it's one of those things like riding a bicycle. Once you've got it, you've got it, but it's tricky to get there. It's almost like heavily articulating a low note, but not following through. It's really just a pocket of air happening in your mouth. That's a slap tongue attack, or it's another form of articulation.\n\nThere's also another, I'm not sure if there's a technical word for this, but I kind of call it my half tonguing a note, which is where you kind of mute a note, the airflow is still going, but you've got your tongue on the reed but still producing a note. This is what it sounds like. That can kind of emulate what trumpet plays call doodle tonguing.", "title": "Basic Tongue Techniques | Saxophone Lessons", "publishedDate": "2013-08-28T02:54:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "ALIAAfJCv7U", "description": "BJ: This Edsel is one of 1,343 ever produced.

Children of any age like to make and sail toy boats. Therefore, it will be an awesome present for International Children's Day on 1st of June. Adults might also be interested in an unusual toy boat construction with the candle used as moving power. The hand made steam boat also has the heating and the steam boiler. The boat moves due to fire, which heats the pipe, suppressing hot water from it. They are substituted with the new portions of hot water, which are sucked in, heat, and thrown out immediately, moving the boat ahead.\nMake a present for with International Children's Day!\n\nWelcome to my channel Roman Ursu where you will learn how to make hand made crafts, New Year crafts, presents, toys, Halloween scares.

We sighted the LB family moving quickly towards a small group 250 m distant. We drove to the family (which turned out to be the HB group) and I immediately noticed that they were bunched together in a distinctive formation, which is a good indication that there may have been a recent birth.\n   Graeme and I were very excited that this could be the first birth of 2011, and we drove in to get a closer look. Sadly, I noticed that the calf was lying flat on the ground and not moving. It then became clear that it was still-born, and the mother (Hollie - 28 years old) was gently nudging the calf with her back leg to determine if it was alive. At this time the LB family arrived and chased Hollie and the other members of the family some 50 m away from the dead calf. Leana, the matriarch of the LB family is 46 years old, while Hope, the matriarch of the HB family is only 31 years old, and as a result Leana is likely to be dominant. \n   Hollie continued to try and approach her calf, but she was repeatedly chased away by Leana and other members of the LB family. After nearly an hour, Leana moved away from the dead calf and Hollie was able to return with her two daughters, Hub (11 years old) and Hibiscius (4 years old), and another young female, HardDrive (11 years old). \n   We stayed close by to observe their behaviour as Hollie continued to rumble softly and rock the calf with her front foot. Hub meanwhile was digging around the dead calf, constantly trying to remove the birth sac from the body with her tusk. \n  I was able to see that the calf was male. He appeared to be almost the size we would expect at birth and therefore may have been only a month or two from reaching full term. \n   After 2 hours we spotted a hyena moving in the grass very close to Hollie and the others. \n   We left after 2.5 hours, and the mother continued to stand over her calf. A sad sight, but a natural event nonetheless.", "title": "Elephant families attend a stillbirth", "publishedDate": "2011-05-29T04:46:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "ALOosDUXW0M", "description": "BM Productions proudly present DANNY!\nBook Now www.benmurphy.com.au\n\nMulti-Talented Entertainer\nWinner of Australian Variety Entertainer of the Year\nAwarded numerous \u201cMo\u201d and \u201cACE\u201d Awards\n\nDanny is truly an extra-ordinarily talented musician, singer and all-round entertainer.

Algebra of logic was developed by George Boole and therefore was named Boolean algebra. It started as a speculative science, accessible only to a narrow circle of scientists. That was until Englishman George Boole bet in the nineteenth century he would create a science completely detached from reality and without any practical application. He turned mathematical logic into algebra of propositions. Boolean algebra is the algebra of two values - true and false. For example, the statement \"6 is an even number\" is true, and the statement \"The Neva flows into the Caspian Sea\" is false.  These 2 elements - true and false - are called constants and they are assigned, respectively, logical 1 and logical 0. In the algebra of logic, propositions can be combined to give new propositions. These new propositions are called functions of the initial propositions of the logical variables A, B, C, each of which can take 0 or 1.Depending on the values of variables and operations, a function can be either 1, or 0. The values of functions are determined by the truth table of this function.  A truth table is a table used to establish a correspondence between all possible configurations of logical variables in a logical function and the values of these functions. All possible logical functions of variables can be formed with the help of 3 main operations:Logical disjunctionLogical conjunction and negationLogical disjunction is an operation also known as OR. The function is true if at least 1 operand is true. OR corresponds to the mathematical operation of union of sets. Logical conjunction is an operation also known as AND. The function is true if both operands are true. It corresponds to the mathematical operation of intersection of  sets. Negation is an operation also known as logical complement. The function is true if the variable is false or vice versa. Of course, like any other science, Boolean algebra has many laws, axioms, rules, etc. But I can safely say that all the computer technology is based on logical constants 1 and 0 and logical operations AND, OR, NOT. Boole made a scientific revolution, and he didn't even know about it. The new concept of logic that he introduced were later used as a basis for the data processors construction. History has shown that Boole lost the bet.
