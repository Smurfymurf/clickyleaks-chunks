It is impossible to learn about Islam from them. These people have an orthodox, traditionalist mindset. You get them in Protestantism, with orthodox ways of thinking. It is very hard to learn religion from these people. The damage they cause is very terrible. They are very ignorant. They cannot address technical university graduates, highly cultured young people. Their language on just about every subject is foolish. Cultured are skeptical of religion when they see the feeble wittedness and narrow minds of such people. If such people are religious, then religion is not for me, they say. That is why atheists hang around with one another. But since I speak in a way that addresses young people, that does not deprive people of the beauties of life and draws them closer to those beauties, even atheists approach me. But we are currently on the receiving end of an intense attack from fanatics. However, if the fanatics did not attack, one of the portents of the End Times would not be coming about. The fanatics have to attack in order for the conditions of the End Times to come about. God insists on the End Times really looking like the End Times. If an eyebrow is missing, God provides one. If an eye is missing, God provides one. The picture that eventually emerges will be of the system of the Mahdi, in front of us as clear as day.

It came in handy today, as you can see from the video with this story.\n\n\"It's what happened, you know, I could not remember in my memory, a truck is coming, and I could not remember exactly how it happened and then the video says that's how it happened, kind of turning like 45 degrees before it hits my vehicle,\" Dr. Zhu said.\n\nThe driver of the cement truck did not suffer major injuries and was given a ticket at the scene.\n\nThe truck spilled its load of cement all over the northbound lanes of Wellborn. It took crews several hours to clean up the mess.\n\nhttp://brandplaza.ro", "title": "\u2605 Cement Truck Flips Over, Crashes in College Station", "publishedDate": "2014-04-09T07:45:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "-W3BvcNTndo", "description": "-No Ethics -No Morals -No Conscience -No Guilt\n    ----------- Dwain Weston ----------", "title": "Dwain Weston - Roll The Dice", "publishedDate": "2011-03-11T07:23:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-W3GcJLQ3wI", "description": "This animated wheel loader shovel truck video for children uses a construction site and wheel loader shovel trucks to teach kids 11 different basic colors.

Your skin is the largest organ in your body, and it absorbs everything including toxins. If you are concerned about not eating unhealthy foods like trans fat, then you'll definitely want to know which synthetic ingredients you should watch out for in the products you use.\n\n    Methyl, Propyl, Butyl and Ethyl Parabens: Used as a preservative to inhibit microbial growth and extend shelf life. Unfortunately, it can cause allergic reactions and skin rashes. Preliminary research found parabens in human breast cancer tumors.\n    Diethanolamine (DEA), Triethanolamine (TEA): These are used as foaming agents, but can cause allergic reactions, eye irritation, and dryness of the hair and skin. DEA and TEA are toxic if absorbed into the body over a long period of time, and are associated with cancer in lab animals.\n    Diazolidinyl Urea, Imidazolidinyl Urea: Often used as preservatives, the American Academy of Dermatology has found these chemicals to be a primary cause of contact dermatitis (irritation caused by foreign substance). Both these chemicals release formaldehyde, which can be toxic.\n    Sodium Lauryl/Laureth Sulfate: This is a cheap, harsh detergent used in many shampoos for its ability to cleanse and foam. Often derived from petroleum, it causes eye irritation, dry scalp, skin rashes and other allergic reactions. Be on the lookout for pseudo-natural products that list this ingredient with the phrase \"comes from coconuts\" - it's still bad for you.\n    Petrolatum: Also known as petroleum jelly, this is a mineral oil derivative that can clog your pores. This in turn disrupts your body's natural ability to moisturize its own skin, leading to dryness and chapping. Manufacturers use it because it's really inexpensive.\n\n    Want to know what else you should avoid? Then read more\n\n    Propylene Glycol: Ideally this is a vegetable glycerin mixed with grain alcohol, both of which are natural, but it's usually made from synthetic chemicals. It has been known to cause hives and eczema. Beware of related chemicals labeled PEG and PPG.\n    PVP/VA Copolymer: A petroleum-derived chemical that's used in hair styling products and some cosmetics. Considered toxic since if inhaled, it can damage the lungs.\n    Stearalkonium Chloride: This toxic chemical was designed by the fabric industry for use as a fabric softener. Companies use it in hair conditioners and lotions because it's much cheaper than natural conditioning ingredients such as proteins.\n    Synthetic Colors: Labeled as FD&C or D&C and followed by a number, these make products look pretty but can be carcinogenic.\n    Synthetic Fragrances: Labeled simply as \"fragrance,\" there's no way to tell what chemicals are actually in the product. People can get headaches, dizziness, rashes, and respiratory problems from them. People may also experience hyper-pigmentation, which means this chemical may cause brown spots to form on your skin.\n\nFit's Tips: Before buying beauty products, check the ingredients list. These ingredients can be found in make-up, lotions, shampoos, conditioners, perfumes, baby care products, sunscreens, toothpastes, nail products, and deodorants. If you're looking for a good brand that doesn't contain these nasty ingredients, check out Aubrey Organics.", "title": "Cosmetics ingredients to watch out for", "publishedDate": "2013-05-15T18:08:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-W5vW63rWA4", "description": "a video I made for my study of AE.", "title": "Dance of Erigeron Philadelphicus [revised]", "publishedDate": "2009-10-21T01:53:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-W5wPNrCdJ4", "description": "http://www.Jentox.com  The Biochemist, JenOalltrades, teaches you a natural chronic bronchitis treatment & heartburn cure.

While impunity for racist violence remains a persistent problem in Greece, the Greek government not only refrains from addressing it, but is also proceeding to institutionalize it, and even to penalize its victims! Last week it submitted in front of the parliament an amendment to the country's Immigration Code that mandates the deportation of immigrants who accuse state employees of using violence against them, in case their claims are officially rejected. It is hair-raising: this provision is a deterrent, punishing not the perpetrators but the victims.\n \n***\nIn Greece, the toleration and non-reporting of violence against immigrants, especially when the perpetrators are state officials, has created a deplorable \"custom\".This reality is being confirmed by many national, European and international organizations. It is our opinion that state tolerance of racist violence, and even more so the institutionalization of this tolerance, supposedly in order to \"protect\" state officials from immigrants and refugees (!), is not within the discretion of any nation-state, neither is it a legitimate way of exercising national sovereignty. The unacceptable austerity programmes which have given rise to conditions of a humanitarian disaster in Greece, along with the disproportionate responsibilities that the country has been shouldered with regarding immigration inflows, do not constitute legitimate excuses that allow for a European country to return to times of state illegality. This would bring us back to a very dark time of our continent. Should we let this happen, we already know that the racist far-right will be the sole beneficiary.\n \nWe are of the opinion that parties and civil society throughout Europe must urgently take a stand ,so as to stop the institutionalization of state racist violence in a European country and to stop the further deterioration of immigrants' rights.\n \n***\n \nThe unacceptable amendment was withdrawn temporarily, but the Minister of Interior stated publicly that it will be tabled once again next week. Further, withdrawn was article 19 in its entirety, which concerns the provision of resident permits for humanitarian reasons, among others, to victims of racist crimes. We call on citizens, public bodies, movements, parties throughout Europe to respond immediately, exerting political pressure upon the Greek government to restore article 19, expunging the abovementioned racist amendement. It is an elementary issue of democracy, humanitarianism and justice.", "title": "Antonis Kafentzopoulos on the racist amendment", "publishedDate": "2014-03-28T17:23:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "-WFxp10hUcY", "description": "Order P/K Lifestyles Outdoor Square Knot Cinnabar Fabric #403721 at: http://www.sailrite.com/P-K-Lifestyles-Outdoor-403721-Square-Knot-Cinnabar-54\n\nP/K Lifestyles Outdoor 403721 Square Knot Cinnabar 54\u2033 is a breathable, spun polyester fabric from P/K Lifestyles' Outdoor Collection.

Between having to wait to blow out the wick after each inhale (or waving it wildly about) and the wick burning sideways and out of control, I found I was burning though wick (and my precious pennies) quickly.\n\nI do my best to not be wasteful with what I have, so I wanted something that would easily and and conveniently solve this problem. It also needed to be portable so I could take it with me anywhere. After all, what good is having a tool or device, if you never have it around to use?\n\nSo after researching what was already available and several prototypes, I made the current iteration of the SmokeWorms Hemp Wick Holder/Dispenser.

Esto puede ocurrir por latigazo cervical u otra lesi\u00f3n en estas \u00e1reas. Degenerativa La artritis de la columna vertebral en el cuello (columna cervical) puede comprimir los nervios que pueden causar tanto dolor de cuello y dolor en el hombro. Enfermedad degenerativa del disco en el cuello (espondilosis cervical) pueden causar dolor en el cuello local o dolor que irradia de una hernia de disco, causando pellizco de los nervios (radiculopat\u00eda cervical). Condiciones anormales que comprometen la m\u00e9dula espinal , coraz\u00f3n , pulmones , y algunos \u00f3rganos abdominales tambi\u00e9n pueden causar dolor de cuello y hombro. \nLesiones por latigazo cervical : Lesi\u00f3n en las estructuras ligamentosas y musculares del cuello y el hombro puede ser causada por la aceleraci\u00f3n o desaceleraci\u00f3n brusca, como en un accidente de coche. Esto tambi\u00e9n puede causar espasmos musculares en el cuello y los hombros.\nTendinitis: Los tendones conectan los m\u00fasculos a los huesos. Con esfuerzo, los tendones pueden inflamarse y causar dolor. Esto tambi\u00e9n se conoce como tendinitis .\nEl dolor: Todo el dolor parece fuerte, pero el dolor tambi\u00e9n puede ser descrito como sordo, quemaz\u00f3n, calambres, shocklike, o punzante. El dolor puede dar lugar a una rigidez en el cuello o el hombro y la p\u00e9rdida de rango de movimiento. Dolor de cabeza puede resultar. El car\u00e1cter de cada uno de los s\u00edntomas es importante para su m\u00e9dico, ya que las caracter\u00edsticas particulares pueden ser indicios de la causa de su dolor.\nDebilidad: La debilidad puede deberse a un dolor severo de m\u00fasculos o movimiento de los huesos. Los nervios que inervan los m\u00fasculos, sin embargo, tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda resultar lesionado. Es importante distinguir la verdadera debilidad (muscular o da\u00f1o en los nervios) de la incapacidad o renuencia a moverse debido al dolor o la inflamaci\u00f3n.\nEntumecimiento: Si los nervios se pellizcan, con moretones, o cortar, no podr\u00e1s ser capaz de sentir las cosas con normalidad. Esto puede causar una sensaci\u00f3n de ardor u hormigueo, p\u00e9rdida de sensaci\u00f3n, o una alteraci\u00f3n de la sensibilidad similar a tener el brazo \"quedarse dormido\".\nFrescura: Un brazo o la mano fr\u00eda sugiere que las arterias, venas, o ambos han sido heridos o bloqueado.

The regency factor gives information about the date of the last transaction. The frequency characteristic tells how often the customer made the purchase. Lastly, the monetary factor shows the amount of money the customer spent over a given period.\n\nEach value in the RFM formula has a different value. The following % ratings are a useful guide to assessing their relative importance.For example, if the regency factor is 50%, Frequency 35% and Monetary 15%. The value of each of these factors varies according to the kind of transactions that take place. \n\nSo the relative importance of the RFM factors should be determined for each particular trading organisation. Once the relative value is established, the RFM formula can be used  for two major functions.\n\nFirstly, it is a useful tool for selecting what should prove to be the most productive segments of the customer file. This means that names are selected for a new promotion on the basis of what you believe to be the most favourable combination of RFM factors.\n\nSecondly, the formula is ideal for detecting inactive names on the customer file. Rather, than simply remove names that have not purchased for, say, two years.\n\n  - created at http://www.b2bwhiteboard.com", "title": "Recency / Frequency / Monetary -  Formula (RFN) - explained", "publishedDate": "2013-03-23T01:45:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "-WlSq2OYdOY", "description": "Pilinha", "title": "Grande pilau", "publishedDate": "2012-11-09T21:23:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "-WlWn1s7AKk", "description": "", "title": "Tremendo En Calamary Territorio Tremendista", "publishedDate": "2014-05-05T17:11:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Wlnyy72TFw", "description": "BOOKING / KONCERTY\nStaszek Kuci\u0144ski +48 691 416 904", "title": "DIADEM - POKOCHAJ MNIE NOWO\u015a\u0106 2009", "publishedDate": "2009-10-09T17:20:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Wm0usrKFI4", "description": "Dracaena marginata* stammt aus Madagaskar und eignet sich f\u00fcr sonnige bis halbschattige Standorte.

Pacu and piranha do not have similar teeth, the main difference being jaw alignment; piranha have pointed, razor-sharp teeth in a pronounced underbite, whereas pacu have squarer, straighter teeth, like a human, and a less severe underbite, or a slight overbite.[1] Additionally, full-grown pacu are much larger than piranha, reaching up to 0.9 m (3 feet) and 25 kg (55 pounds) in the wild.\n\nPacu is a term of Brazilian Indian origin. When the large fish of the Colossoma genus entered the aquarium trade in the U.S. and other countries, they were erroneously labeled pacu. In the Amazon, the term pacu is reserved to smaller and medium sized fish in the Metynnis, Mylossoma and Myleus genera. The Colossoma macropomum fish are known as tambaqui, whereas Piaractus brachypomus is known as pirapitinga.", "title": "pacu fish tank", "publishedDate": "2014-05-24T23:16:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Wpwydy2pJw", "description": "\u201cDid you know the tongue is the strongest muscle in the body?\u201d\n\nShare on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1wtGR9k\nLike BuzzFeedVideo on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/18yCF0b\nShare on Twitter:http://bit.ly/1wtGTOz\n\nMusic:\n\nEchoing Mistress\nMusic Licensed Via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nGET MORE BUZZFEED:\nwww.buzzfeed.comwww.buzzfeed.co\u00adm/video\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeed\nwww.youtu\u00adbe.com/buzzfeedvideo\nwww.youtube.com/buzz\u00adfeedyellow\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedpop\nwww\u00ad.youtube.com/cnnbuzzfeed\n\nBUZZFEED VIDEO\nBuzzFeed is the world's first true social news organization.

Lanigan. The goal was to provide the most in-depth and most recent Facts About Beta Glucan.\n\nListen to What is Beta Glucan?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY6gxdBI8AsnZ2Hn4jloBNPsQf6zNwYeQ\n\nWant to buy Beta Glucan? Click here!\nhttp://www.betterwayhealth.com/products/transfer-point-beta-glucan/beta-glucan-60-capsules-500-mg-immune-enhancer.html\n\nBeta Glucan enhances the immune system by improving the immune response when the immune system is confronted by something that does not belong. This could be a foreign body that it sees as \"non-self,\" something like a virus, a bacteria, a fungus form, a cancer or a parasite.\n\nTransfer Point Beta-1, 3D Glucan is an intensely purified, highly active form of Beta Glucan; that, when taken orally with a glass of water, attaches to specific sites on the immune cells: the CR3 receptors. By attaching or binding to these specific sites, it activates these cells. It's like putting the cells on \"high alert\" to the foreign bodies that they see as non-self. This process is referred to as immune modulation, not stimulation. Immune stimulation presumably occurs with substances like Echinacea and Eolostrum. Beta Glucan modulates or activates but doesn't over stimulate, which is key to the safety of the compound.\n\nResearch shows that our Beta-1, 3D Glucan is a highly effective immune modulator. It's easily absorbed through, what we call, the Peyer's Patches in the Small Intestine. Once these beta glucan \"micro-particles\" are taken up through this area in the small intestine, they will then be absorbed through phagocytosis or \"gobbled up\" by the immune cells in the gut. They'll travel around the body and it is the immune cells themselves that will digest and secrete the perfect molecule that binds to the CR 3 receptor and activates the immune system.", "title": "3.

Hoffmann, M.D., University of South Florida Dept. of Neurology, with \"High functioning autism with splinter savant traits\" and \"markedly impaired verbal abilities, but visuospatial remains exceptional.\" \n\nMichael W. Hoffmann, M.D. wrote Mary Katherine Day-Petrano in his e-mail medical records of March 25, 2009, \"So the PET brain revealed bilateral temporal (but less so parietal) hypometabolism. This is exactly the deficits found in autistic children and I believe some autistic adults (adults are rarer to come by). Is that not interesting ! It confirms what we suspected clinically and gives you powerful neuroimaging evidence. regards Michael Hoffmann MD.\" \n\nIn otherwords, Mary Katherine Day-Petrano is an adult with Autism with the brain of an autistic child. \n\nAlong with Autism, Mary has severe sensory overload sensitivities. This video shows her extreme sensory overload to loud sounds that do not bother most others. Mary also has hyperacusia and cannot withstand over a 10-15 db level according to audiogram by her doctor, Guy LaFond, M.D. Her Autism sensory overload to sound is so severe, Loren Bartels, M.D./FACS wrote that most Courtroom construct could not be made accessible to her. Carl Schwait, lawyer for Nationwide, knew about these issues, having admitted in writing to having hundreds of pages of Mary's medical and disability information in his possesion. \n\nSounds or visual stimuli that are tolerated by normal people may cause pain, confusion and/or fear in some autistic people. Sensory over sensitivity can vary from very slight to severe. Autistic people with severe sensory sensitivities will often have tantrums and other what becomes labeled as \"bad behavior\" in crowded public places due to sensory overload. Such people are the ones who will most likely need environmental modifications. Autistic adults, who remain nonverbal and have very little functional language that is understandable by others, often have more severe sensitivities. Temple Grandin, Ph.D., Frequently Asked Questions About Autism, http://www.autism.com/index.php/grandin_FAQ .\n\nThe lawsuit pleading writing process shown in this Autism sound sensory overload video  is what Carl Schwait, Chief of The Florida Bar Disciplinary Committee, partner at Dell Graham law firm of Gainesville Florida, and Nationwide's lawyer, as well as Hon. US Magistrate Gary R. Jones in Petranos v. Old Republic et al., 1:12-cv-00086-SPM/GRJ call \"a shotgun pleading,\" \"vexatious litigation,\" \"willful failure to comply with court orders,\" \"sanctionable,\" and justification to dismiss an Autism / brain damage lawsuit seeking access to exactly the help, funding, medical care, and assistance this video shows the Autistic person needs. US Chief Bankruptcy Judge Karen Specie agreed with Carl Schwait's (her former law partner at Dell Graham law firm, Gainesville Florida) and Magistrate Jones' characterization of what this video shows occurring, which is instead actually attributable to a disability breakdown in the pleading process due to no properly effective Autism assistance from the Court. \n\nThis video shows how US Federal Judges are harshly punishing disabled Americans simply for seeking meaningful Court access to seek disability remedies in the first place. \n\nIt also shows a MASSIVE failure to understand and modify US Court policies and practices for people with Asperger's, conductive hearing loss, and Autism with Autism sensory overload issues.  \n\nAs this video shows, something is TERRIBLY WRONG with The Florida Bar's mandatory continuing legal education of the lawyers it licenses and with the US Federal Courts' preparation to handle cases brought by people with Autism.", "title": "Autism Sensory Overload to Sound When Deaf Aspie Forced To Help Autistic Wife Write Court Pleadings", "publishedDate": "2013-12-25T05:01:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "-WunGo0VdbQ", "description": "My tutorial on how to add text to a gif!\nLeave a comment, subscribe, and like if I helped :)x", "title": "Photoshop Tutorial - How To Add Text To A Gif", "publishedDate": "2013-03-25T20:30:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-WuyJNwv62I", "description": "live blood darkfield, darkfield microscope, live blood microscope, darkfield microscopy, live blood microscopy, live blood courses, live blood cell, blood cancer, blood tests, human blood, blood tests, Live Blood Analysis, Live Blood Cell Analysis, bechamp, enderlein dr. enderlein, sanum, sanum remedies, pleomorphism, endobiont, acid and alkaline, pH, cell Analysis, Living, blood cells, LIVE BLOOD CELL, Blood Analysis, Live Blood, video, living blood, Cells, Live blood cell, Blood Cell Analysis, live cells, living blood cells, living cells @ www.dreddyclinic.com", "title": "Erythrocytes & Granulocytes", "publishedDate": "2009-05-13T15:17:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "-WvP5OxdxGE", "description": "This synthetic Ruby boule is made of powder of aluminium oxide and chromium (that give the red color of the Ruby) Al2O3+Cr2O3. The powder falls through a tube with oxygen gaz and is joined with an other tube with hydrogen (Oxy-hydrogen flame). The two gases burn at a very high temperature to melt the corundum (melting point is 2000 C). The melted powder falls onto a rotating tower which is gradually lowered to build up a \"boule\" like you can see on this video. The powder will crystalize to form that boule in few hours, from 2 to 6 depending of the size you want. During growth considerable stresses are built up within the crystal, and here you can see how they split it in half to release that stress. The video was made in DJEVA Industry in Monthey, Switzerland, where they are growing high quality Corundum and Spinel.\n\nThis half- boule can be cut to make a beautifull ruby perfectly identical at the natural one!\n\nThe Verneuil process was named after Prof. A V L Verneuil who produced the first synthetic rubies in 1902. With this method you can process many different colors of Corundum's (Trigonal), Spinels (Cubic), Rutile (Tetragonal) and Strontium Titanate (Cubic), the last two are used as diamond simulant.\n\nNatural non treated Rubies are very very rare over 2 carats (1 gram = 5 carats) and synthetics Rubies where set in jewelry already long time ago. The physical and optical property of the synthetic Rubies are exactly the same as the natural one. Just the price change, one gram of a perfect natural ruby that is 5 carats will go for 200.000$US or more (50.000 to 100.000$US/carat), the same synthetic counterpart will cost 10$ (2 to 5$US/carat). That's why it is so frequent to find synthetic Rubies in jewelry already long time ago.\n\nThe synthetic Rubies are used a in watches, jewelry and other high tech devices.\n\nI am a Professional Gemologist and I have a Gem Laboratory in Mexico where there is a lot of imitation and synthetics stones on the market.\n\nI would like to start some videos to educate people about the difference of simulants, synthetics and naturals crystals as the price will change drastically and may people are fooled.", "title": "Splitting a Ruby boule - Verneuil synthesis of Corundum - DJEVA - Switzerland", "publishedDate": "2011-01-27T14:12:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "-WveHIhjOQU", "description": "Gin/Tonic - Music on a new level.\nFacebook: http://tinyurl.com/n7er3s6 \nWebsite: http://tinyurl.com/lkte32j\nTwitter: http://tinyurl.com/mrjktad\nPinterest: http://tinyurl.com/mcs43dg\n\nFree Download\nhttps://soundcloud.com/sablemusic/basenji-speak-with-a-dofflin-sable-remix\n\nFollow Basenji\nhttps://www.facebook.com/officialbasenji\nhttps://soundcloud.com/officialbasenji\n\nFollow Sable\nhttps://soundcloud.com/sablemusic\nhttps://www.facebook.com/soundsable\n\nPicture by Larsen Sotelo:\nhttp://www.larsensotelo.com/\n\nFor copyright issues please contact: info@giftedandtalented.net.au", "title": "Basenji - Speak With a Dofflin (Sable Remix)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-29T09:49:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-WvfOZ2KwgE", "description": "Mark Warner kicks-off a canvass weekend at the Fredericksburg, Va. campaign office.  \n\nTo volunteer, visit http://www.markwarner2008.com.", "title": "Canvass Kickoff for Mark Warner", "publishedDate": "2008-08-12T23:43:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Wvh1BS3KJg", "description": "Kam Chancellor destroys OT Eric Winston", "title": "Kam Chancellor destroys OT Eric Winston", "publishedDate": "2014-02-28T02:21:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Wvpg4oo6xU", "description": "I have only seen two of these in the past year.

They can detect details and motions at high speeds, often capturing reality in ways that our physical eyes cannot.\n\nMy project, \"Compound Eyes\" deals with an articulation of architectural spaces using multiple cameras which are simultaneously filming out from the sides of a cube. The cube holding the cameras was carried by Latex balloons to a height of 120 meters above Schlossbergplatz and then released and dropped, capturing the city landscape from several different points of view simultaneously. By using balloons to raise and drop the cameras, it is possible to experience the change of architectural perspective from ground level to birds eye view. When synchronized and assembled, the resulting footage creates various organic filmic movements which articulate Graz\u00b4s architecture in a multi-faceted and intricate way.\n\nThe project was realised with the help of various people in Graz including Johannes Muhr, Benjamin Schmid, Christina Gobin, and other young students of Graz.\n\nDavid Romberg, 2009", "title": "Compound Eyes (sunset)", "publishedDate": "2009-09-13T00:30:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "-X77P69ngWM", "description": "While Trunks watches.", "title": "Cell vs. Stomachache", "publishedDate": "2012-03-05T23:47:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-X7HchntLcM", "description": "\uc11c\uc9c4\uc774\uac00 father's day \uc5d0 \ub178\ub798\uc120\ubb3c\uc744 \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "title": "\uae40\uc11c\uc9c4 \ub178\ub798\ud574\uc694.  \uc0ac\ub791\ud574\uc694", "publishedDate": "2014-06-20T14:53:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "-X7RJitrayc", "description": "LONGHORN CHEER STAMPEDE UNITED CHEER NATIONALS 2013 GALVESTON, TX", "title": "LONGHORN CHEER STAMPEDE UNITED CHEER NATIONALS 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-04-23T18:54:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "-X7W8d0v6IQ", "description": "Detestation", "title": "Detestation - Dying Every Day", "publishedDate": "2011-06-24T18:27:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-X7WbkZlxYM", "description": "\"TMZ\"", "title": "Auntie Fee At \"TMZ\" Part 2", "publishedDate": "2014-08-05T19:28:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "-X7njG9rR6Q", "description": "ACE Pr\u00eats Immobiliers est une agence de courtage en cr\u00e9dit immobilier situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Tours, Indre-et-Loire (37).

This process, called vasodilation, supports blood flow, oxygen delivery to tissues, glucose uptake into working muscles and nutrient transportation to \"feed\" tissue repair and growth.\n\nCheck out our online store:\n\nProzis International: http://www.prozis.com\nProzis Italia: http://www.prozis.it\nProzis Espa\u00f1a: http://www.prozis.es\nProzis Portugal: http://www.prozis.pt\nProzis France: http://www.prozis.fr\nProzis Brasil: http://www.prozis.com/br_pt\nProzis Belgique: http://www.prozis.be\nProzis Deutschland: http://www.prozis.de\nProzis United Kingdom: http://www.prozis.co.uk\nProzis Russia: http://www.prozis.ru\n\nFollow our Facebook for exclusive content and discounts:\n\nProzis International: http://www.facebook.com/ProzisInternational\nProzis Italia: http://www.facebook.com/ProzisItalia\nProzis Espa\u00f1a: http://www.facebook.com/ProzisEspana\nProzis Portugal: http://www.facebook.com/ProzisPortugal\nProzis France: http://www.facebook.com/ProzisFrance\nProzis Brasil: http://www.facebook.com/ProzisBrasil\nProzis United Kingdom: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Prozis-United-Kingdom", "title": "NO2 Platinum", "publishedDate": "2012-07-09T09:35:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-XAJ-dUrYCw", "description": "Hi, everyone!

Protest? Participate in a rally? Walk all the way across the country?\n\nWe are.\n\nThis summer, a group of activists will be walking across America to achieve more freedom and liberty.\n\nOur pioneer forefathers trekked across the continent from the east to the west to find a better life for themselves. This time, we're doing it in reverse.\n \nI am walking coast-to-coast across the country, from Oregon to New Hampshire. I am joined by my immediate family as well. We're on a quest to gain more freedom for ourselves and for our country by spreading the message of freedom and liberty along the way.\n\nWhy are we doing this?\n\nWe see the gradual chipping away at freedoms in America, and want to do our part to stop it. My wife and I are moving to New Hampshire as part of the Free State Project. New Hampshire is already the freest state in the country, which is why we are moving there. But we also want to help bring more freedom to as many other people as possible.\n\nTherefore we are walking across America to get to New Hampshire. We are walking all the way there to bring as much media attention and publicity as possible to two liberty-oriented causes: the Free State Project, which is working to make New Hampshire even more free, and Ron Paul's message of freedom for everyone. To learn more about the Free State Project, visit http://freestateproject.org To learn more about Ron Paul, visit http://ronpaul2008.com\n\nFollow Our Progress\n\nRead my blog at http://willbuchanan.com/blog to learn more about the latest in our preparations for the Walk For Liberty and our progress and adventures during it. You may also subscribe to it at http://willbuchanan.com/blog/feed\n\nHow you can help\n\nPlease visit http://walkforliberty.com/help-out if you'd like to help the Walk For Liberty achieve more freedom for everyone.\n\nDonate\n\nWould you consider donating $3 to help support the Walk For Liberty?

We're going to have to remove the anchor bar to inspect the damaged area and try to determine the best course of repair moving forward,\" said Matt Emmons, the lockmaster.\n\nOn Monday, inspectors for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers found the hairline crack in this 78-year-old section of steel.\n\"The steel components are older, and over time, stresses occur and issues like this can arise,\" said Emmons.\nWhile those repairs are underway, the closure of the old is a reason why some are pushing for the new lock just hundreds of feet away to get more funding.\nU.S. Representative Chuck Fleischmann, R-TN of the Third District, explained to NewsChannel9's Briona Arradondo where the state of both locks stands.\n\"Funding is in place for the current Chickamauga lock, which we've gotten done through the appropriations process, so that the necessary repairs can be made now and in the future. It's going to be a while before the new lock is even complete, six to eight years if we had all the funding today,\" said Fleischmann.\nProject Manager Don Getty said they already spent $182 million on the new lock replacement project since the mid-2000s, but then funding stopped. So, Fleischmann and Getty said a few years ago Congress had to fix the allocation of money from the Inland Waterway Trust Fund, which is a pool of money that funds several locks across the nation, to equal benefit all projects involved. \nIn 2014, legislation passed that brings back money for those projects through the Water Resource Development Act, and it freed up about $112 million. But the new Chickamauga lock is fourth on the priority list, and it would receive any of that money for now. \nIt will be several years before boats will pass through the new lock, so officials said it's vital to keep the current old lock in working shape.\nFleischmann said another option to bump up funding for the new lock would be to increase the marine diesel fuel tax, which is an option the water traffic community supports, according to the congressman.

It can be installed on various moving and stationary objects for fighting low flying aerial threats, for destroying lightly armoured and unarmoured materiel, weapons, and concentrated enemy personnel at ranges up to 2,000 m.\n\nThe machine gun design ensures high grouping and accuracy of fire in a wide sector of traverse and elevation. It has an open type of iron sight and a device for fitting an optic and night sight.\n.\nThe propitious engineering and design decisions along with manufacturability gave the KORD machine gun effective combat performance and ease of maintenance. It differs from its counterpart in:\n\n    * high reliability of operation at environment temperature of \u00b1 50\u00b0 C, in dusty conditions, after immersion in water, without cleaning and lubricating for a number of days, in case of icing and in other adverse operating conditions;\n    * the trouble-free operation and the capability to conduct intense fire without additional cooling of the barrel and with retention of aiming accuracy;\n    * consistent grouping, accuracy and rate of fire throughout the entire service life of the weapon;\n    * ease of maintenance and the capability to rectify faults by the crew in course of combat employment with the aid of individual SPTA; high reparability of the machine gun at troops' facilities.\n.\nThe KORD machine gun's attractive feature to the troops is the similarity of its weight, size and connection parameters with those of the \"Utyos\" (NSV-12.7 mm) machine gun. This allows to replace the latter without adjustment in all machine gun complexes. It's worth noting that in terms of main characteristics the KORD exceeds by far its predecessor.\n\nFor aimed firing, KORD can be installed complete with a machine gun mount and supportion all automotive or armoured vehicles, on helicopters, sea vessels, and railroad cars. If necessary, it can be easily removed from the installation for use in troops formations to support them with fire in all types of operations. When placed on combat vehicles, the machine gun design allows to secure the ammunition box on its hinges, to fasten the machine gun in the \"combat configuration\", to collect or deflect spent cases, to collect the belt links, to bring the machine gun into the carrier through its hatch or door for placing on a mount.\n\nKORD provides effective firing from any position of the fire on a prepared or unprepared firing emplacement, from buildings, moving or standing vehicles. The relatively small weight and the capability to rapidly convert the weapon from travelling to combat configuration enable the crew to change quickly their firing positions for enhanced survivability, unexpectedness and effectiveness of fire.\n\nAround 22 countries manufacture now 12.7x99 mm NATO cartridges. On this basis, KORD machine gun has been developed in all above described variants using those cartridges. The performance and maintenance specifications of the gun did not change despite changes in the design decisions of the barrel and feeding mechanism.\n.\n\nTechnical Characteristics\nCaliber, mm 12.7\nFiring rate, rounds per minute not less than 600\nBullet muzzle velocity, m/s 820-860\nAimed firing range, m up to 2,000\nBarrel weight, kg 9.25\nLoaded magazine weight, kg 11.1\n50 cartridges belt weight, kg 7.7\nMachine gun traverse angle\nrelative to fixed bipod \u00b1 15\u00b0\nGrouping (R50) at 100 m range, mm not more than 300\nTechnical endurance, shots 10,000\nArmor piercing capability at 100 m, mm up to 20", "title": "kord tracers nightsight", "publishedDate": "2008-10-01T02:12:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-XT2C_IU_Sk", "description": "Wally, p\u00e9tulante cadre trentenaire, est l'\u00e9pouse de Pango, dynamique cadre quadrag\u00e9naire.

This exposes a twisting and tampering with the pure words of the Bible and opens up a whole new definition to what a Church really is. We find out that the Church is not an institution at all! Is it really possible that the Authorized King James Version of the Bible was INTENTIONALLY DOCTORED to reinforce and support a \"priest class\" and institutional, political hierarchies. The Protestant Reformation didn't go far enough. It didn't really eliminate the temple worship and priest class, it just put a nicer face on it. \n\nThis explains why things are this bad. It explains why most of this thing we call \"Christianity\" is in fact, not at ALL what Jesus had in mind. This explains why so many are being abused in a \"system\" that was NEVER what God designed in the first place.\n\nThis book also answers the question: What is a Pastor? What is an Elder? What is a Bishop? are we all priests or just a few?

We strive to convey to the wine the energy and life that we provide to our grapes so that the wine is the most palatable and alive possible. Biodynamic agriculture is first and foremost taking care of the soil. We must guarantee its balance and craft harmonic relationships between the soil, the plant and the environment.\nMode of driving of the vineyard, wine-making and ageing :\nThe soil receives a thorough care in order to : better the leaf development, enhance the plant roots, increase the soil quality by augmenting the variety of bacteria. One row out of two is grassed with a temporary grass made of a mix of various plants with the purpose of creating the largest possible biodiversity and insect shelter\u2026Each vine treatment is continually performed with herbal decoctions - nettles, equisetum and willows. Compost and soil preparation are extremely important. Grapes are gathered manually. The grape is wholly poured in the press without crushing or destemming so that it\u2019s not damaged. The pressurage is performed slowly and gently. We let Mother Nature do the work, with terroir yeast whenever possible except if there\u2019s some grey rot in the grape skin. The fermentation temperature is between 18 \u00b0 C to 25 \u00b0 C. After the fermentation process, the wine is kept on lees till the spring .", "title": "Patrimoine Des Terroirs - Domaine Frey", "publishedDate": "2014-08-26T17:54:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-XeVtFlx_ww", "description": "Amazing!

He made his professional debut on 29 November 1992 against Groningen at the age of 16 years and 242 days, making him the youngest debutant for Ajax ever.[6] In his early career, he played a role in Ajax's Eredivisie winning years of 1994 and 1995. He was also a key member during Ajax's 1995 UEFA Champions League winning campaign, being replaced in the 53rd minute of the final by striker Nwankwo Kanu.[7] Patrick Kluivert scored a late goal to lift Ajax to a 1--0 victory over Italian giants Milan,[8] who Seedorf would later go on to represent for a decade.[9] After making his name in the Ajax side, Seedorf had one season with Sampdoria,[10] scoring three goals in his debut Serie A season.", "title": "Clarence Seedorf \u2022 Glorious \u2022 Skills,Goals & Assists \u2022 Botafogo \u2022 |2013|HD|", "publishedDate": "2013-09-13T04:41:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Xgjb8spwew", "description": "Sign up Elliott's Newsletter: http://hulsestrength.com/go/youtube\n\nStrength YouTube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/strengthcamp\n\nElliott's Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/elliotthulse\n\nNonjob Revolution: http://nonjob.com\n\nStrength Blog: http://www.HulseStrength.com", "title": "How to destroy self doubt", "publishedDate": "2013-05-03T00:00:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "-XhE_t2KuIQ", "description": "As my first ever Youtube video, so please let me know what you think of it (To get the better quality video choose an HD option) - \n\nMalagasy Green Marbled Burrowing Frogs\nNomenclature: Scaphiophryne marmorata\nIUCN Red List: Vulnerable\n\nInfo: Is 1 of 8 species of the Scaphiophryne genus (members of the Microhylidae family).

My practice is 16 miles from O'Connell Street in Dublin. My practice is very accessible from Dublin and all surrounding counties. \n\nMy practice is called Paul Kelly veterinary surgery.\nIn my practice we cater mostly for small animals and exotics pets. One of the most common procedures I carry out most days is female dog neutering and spaying, that's if they are at least five or six months old, that's the earliest age at which you can carry that particular procedure on female pups.\n\nSpaying a dog is removing the reproductive organs i.e. removing the ovaries and the whom from the animal. This means that your female dog is not going to be coming into heat which normally attracts all the neighbourhood male dogs to your home or property. It also means that you are not going to have unexpected litters of pups arriving unexpectedly.\n\nWhen spaying a bitch- female dog it means making an incision which can be up to three inches, depending on the size of the bitch and the organs to be removed. We also carry out another procedure called keyhole or laparoscopic spays surgery .\n\nWith this procedure you will typically have two incisions in a dog the size of a Labrador, each wound will be around five to ten millimeters, in smaller dogs three to five kilo dogs you will only have one five millimeter wound.\n\nThe procedure is performed using a laparoscope which is a fiber optic cable using light and a camera. During surgery this enables me to see what I am doing inside the dog on a TV monitor in the operating room.\n\nThis minimizes trauma to the bitch, there is a much faster recovery and each female dog gets a full medical check to ensure that they are fit to undergo the surgery.\nThe benefits of spaying are no unexpected or unwanted litters of pups.\n\nIf the bitch is spayed before she comes into first heat it greatly reduces the chances of developing Pyometra which is an infection of the whom, spaying reduces the chances of pyometra from 25% down to 2% to 5%. It also prevents phantom pregnancies developing.\n\nIf you have any questions or need some advice about neutering or spaying your female dog do not hesitate to contact me or any member of our staff at 01-8027604 or visit our website at http://paulkellyvet.com.

He's always moving, whether he chooses to or not.\n\n\"Well if I don't use it I go into shaking in my right arm, real bad. And I can't do anything with it. I can't stop it,\" says Tanner. \n\nHis tremors are a symptom of Parkinson's disease. Not to be mistaken for a more common disorder called essential tremor.\n\n\"Essential tremor is a disorder of the brain. There are some abnormal signals in the brain that miscommunicates with the hands and the muscles and specifically muscles in the hands. People's muscles are totally normal,\" says Dr. Amanda Avila, neurologist on Lee Memorial Health System's medical staff. \n\nEssential tremors are rhythmic shakes, most noticeable when someone is trying to use their fine motor skills.\n\n\"Tremors can interfere with the ability for people to write legibility. Other things are getting dressed in the morning, specifically buttoning or zipping or putting on make up or fastening jewelry. People also have trouble with eating,\" says Dr. Avila. \n\nOn the other hand, Parkinson's patients like Tanner, have resting tremors. Which come on when they aren't doing anything.  \n\n\"I used to try to stop it, I'd put it in my pocket. It doesn't go away,\" says Tanner.\n\nWhile tremors link the two conditions, there are several things that set them apart. Parkinson's patients also have rigid muscles, weakness in the face and throat that cause lack of expression and along with slow, soft speech. And trouble with walking and balance.\n\nParkinson's stems from a deficiency of dopamine in the brain. Essential tremor is thought to result from faulty neurological impulses. A variety of treatments are available to alleviate essential tremors.\n\n\"If the tremor is very mild we usually just prescribe or suggest occupational therapy. If the tremor is a little more bothersome, there are a variety of medications and some of them work very well,\" says Dr. Avila. \n\nSevere cases may benefit from deep brain stimulation. All options to help people get a grip on their shaking. \n\n\nView More Health Matters video segments at leememorial.org/healthmatters/\n \nLee Memorial Health System in Fort Myers, FL is the largest network of medical care facilities in Southwest Florida and is highly respected for its expertise, innovation and quality of care.

Crocodylinae, in which all its members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes Tomistoma, is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes Tomistoma, the alligators and caimans, the gharials, and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.\n\nAnaconda:\nA member of the boa family, South America\u2019s green anaconda is, pound for pound, the largest snake in the world. Its cousin, the reticulated python, can reach slightly greater lengths, but the enormous girth of the anaconda makes it almost twice as heavy.\n\nGreen anacondas can grow to more than 29 feet (8.8 meters), weigh more than 550 pounds (227 kilograms), and measure more than 12 inches (30 centimeters) in diameter. Females are significantly larger than males. Other anaconda species, all from South America and all smaller than the green anaconda, are the yellow, dark-spotted, and Bolivian varieties.\ncrocodile vs shark,\ncrocodile vs anaconda,\ncrocodile vs tiger,\ncrocodile vs hippo,\ncrocodile vs lion,\ncrocodile vs snake,\ncrocodile vs akainu,\ncrocodile vs doflamingo full fight,\ncrocodile vs zebra,\ncrocodile vs lion fight,\ncrocodile attacks,\ncrocodile attacks human in swimming pool,\ncrocodile attacks human,\ncrocodile attacks zebra,\ncrocodile attacks lion,\ncrocodile attacks man,\ncrocodile attacks full movie,\ncrocodile attacks human live,\ncrocodile attacks human in thailand,", "title": "World Animal,Crocodile vs Anaconda-Crocodile Attack Anaconda", "publishedDate": "2014-10-13T17:25:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-YBfsXpFJKM", "description": "At the recent CTC Corporate Treasurers Forum in New York, Dennis Sweeney, Managing Director, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Robert Kane, former CFO of WestPoint Home, and Andrew Skobe, Executive Vice President and CFO of Croscill Home, discussed the value of rotational programs in developing talent in treasury and finance.", "title": "Treasury & Finance Careers: The Value of Rotational Programs", "publishedDate": "2013-08-05T17:03:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "-YBjgC-AsP0", "description": "", "title": "alla sera di ugo foscolo letto d vittorio gassman", "publishedDate": "2010-10-01T19:21:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "-YCBAueiOVQ", "description": "Buy it here: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/birthmark-single/id680713479\n\n'Birthmark' by Cass Lowe and Aidan O'Brien\nProduced by Cass Lowe and Aidan O'Brien \nMixed by Chris Elms\nEngineered by Joe Rubel\n\nDirector: Daryl A\nProduction Company: Sudden Black\nExecutive Producer: Adam Mustafa\nUnit A Producer: Paris Zarcilla\nUnit B Producer: Dan Bliss\nAssociate Producer: Kirsty Bennett\nDoP: Stephen Murphy\n\nGaffer: Robert White\nWardrobe & Art Department: Amy Addison\nProduction Assistants: Bliss Newman, Tessa Lawer\n1st AD: Daniel Bliss\nEdit: Daryl A\nGrade: Dan Moran @ Smoke And Mirrors\nVFX: Simon Reeves @ Analogue, Daryl A\n\nUnit A\n2nd AD: Odinn Hilmarsson\nFocus Puller: Emilio Schlappi\nLoader: Richard Staf\nDolly Grip: Sam Phillips\nSpark: Matt Vahey\nVFX Supervisor & DIT: Matthew Allen\nWardrobe Assistant: Lauren Naylor\nHair @ MUA: Verity Pitt\n\nUnit B\n2nd AD: Jacob Temple\n1st AC: Marcus Autelli\n2nd AC: Henry Keep\nHair & MUA: Chloe Barr\nWardrobe Assistant: Tessa Lawer\nDIT: Odinn Hilmarsson", "title": "Cass Lowe - Birthmark", "publishedDate": "2013-07-30T09:36:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "-YCC6dy0Kfw", "description": "This video is about the radioisotope Yttrium-90 and how it's used in medicine to treat liver tumours.

The elbow also consists of ligaments that hold these bones in place, tendons that attach muscles to bones, cartilage that allows for smooth movement of the bones at their joints, and nerves that provide functionality to the arm. Each of these different parts can become irritated or strained resulting in pain.\nMost commonly elbow pain occurs due to a condition called tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis. This pain is often the result of overuse and repetitive strain due to the repetitive or blunt bending of the wrist under resistance. Other causes of elbow pain include pinched nerves, inflammation or rupturing of the biceps or triceps tendons, hyperextension, or dislocation.\nThe most common treatments for elbow pain include rest and ice. KT Tape is used to provide support and give relief to associated tendons and ligaments, as well as relax the surrounding muscles.

The first material where magnetism could be controlled by light was discovered in 1996. In materials at that time, magnetism only changed with exposure to light at the very low temperature of 25 K. But that was a world-first discovery, so researchers gave it a lot of attention. What we wanted to do was to switch magnetism at room temperature. So we focused on photochromic materials, which, to put it simply, change color when exposed to light. This is a very common research topic in photochemistry. We started by wondering if we could make a material where photochromic properties can be effectively combined with current magnetic substances. And so far, weve been able to make a variety of such materials.\n\nThe Einaga Lab has focused on the strategy of fabricating nanosized magnets, and combining them with photochromic materials that give an optical response. By creating new materials in this way, the researchers have succeeded in reversible optical switching of magnetism at room temperature. \n\nThe Einaga Lab is also studying diamond as a next-generation material. \n\nQ. Diamond is widely known, and actually used, as the hardest substance. A lot of research is being done on semiconducting diamond, which has been doped with small amounts of impurities. We were interested in a new approach: by doping diamond with larger amounts of impurities, we increase its conductivity, so its close to that of a metal, and we use it as electrodes. When we investigated the characteristics of this type of diamond, we found it had properties totally different from those of other electrodes. Its becoming increasingly possible to use this material in sensor applications.\n\nThe Einaga Lab started by actually synthesizing this conducting diamond using microwave plasma CVD. The researchers are currently studying a wide range of topics, from electrochemical measurements to sensor applications.", "title": "Functional materials for the near future : Einaga's Group", "publishedDate": "2010-02-13T07:26:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "-YeE-lbJwl4", "description": "CAF ANGOUMOIS", "title": "CAF ANGOUMOIS Sylvia", "publishedDate": "2008-11-19T19:41:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "-YexaHIUf5E", "description": "So, it looks as though I must teach these Feminists a lesson!

Whales surfacing, breathing in cold air. Coll starling imitate the noise of farm machinery from the hollow ring of a ruined bothy. The rattle of wood over a black stream... Chris Watson's second CD is a dramatic contrast to the spacious atmospheres of \"Stepping into the Dark\" (Touch TO:27, 1996). Featuring 22 close-up recordings of animals, birds and insect life, \"Outside the Circle of Fire\" enlarges our awareness of the sound universe, intimate with voices from the past. There is an intensity here that television pictures cannot conjure.\n \n \"An exhilarating journey into nature's most private sonic ceremonies. Dreamily voyeuristic. Mysterious, perplexing, shocking and beautiful all at once. The Jaguar will destroy you.\" (Akin Fernandez)\n \n \n Watson is one of the world's leading recorders of wildlife and natural phenomena, and for Touch he edits his field recordings into a filmic narrative. For example. the unearthly groaning of ice in an Icelandic glacier is a classic example of, in Watson's words, putting a microphone where you can't put your ears. He was born in Sheffield where he attended Rowlinson School and Stannington College (now part of Sheffield College). In 1971 he was a founding member of the influential Sheffield-based experimental music group Cabaret Voltaire. His sound recording career began in 1981 when he joined Tyne Tees Television. Since then he has developed a particular and passionate interest in recording the wildlife sounds of animals, habitats and atmospheres from around the world. As a freelance recordist for film, tv & radio, Chris Watson specialises in natural history and documentary location sound together with track assembly and sound design in post production, and has won many awards for his work.", "title": "04 Chris Watson - Red Rumped Tinkerbird [Touch]", "publishedDate": "2013-03-17T03:48:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-YwPIVKxf2w", "description": "A glossary, also known as a vocabulary, or clavis, is an alphabetical list of terms in a particular domain of knowledge with the definitions for those terms.

Since then, many cases involving this legal concept have emerged, including three in the last 10 years.\n\nTime then for this timely work of reference on the subject authored by Ben McFarlane and published recently by the Oxford University Press.  It is wide-ranging, detailed and an excellent analysis of this emerging, or actually, re-emerging area of law.  Practical, reassured, balanced and readable, 'the book will be much relied upon,' says Neuberger, 'by practising lawyers and judges.'\n\nIf ever you as a practitioner have cause to feel that all too familiar frisson of fear in court when 'proprietary estoppel' raises its head, you need fear no longer; not when you have this reassuringly erudite book to hand.  As 'proprietary estoppel' is a multi-faceted concept, the book demonstrates how and why this is so.  \n\nThe concept has three strands:  the acquiescence-based strand... the representation-based strand... and the promise-based strand, any or all of which might, or can be applied to issues that frequently concern land or chattels, although not necessarily.\n\nMcFarlane makes frequent reference throughout the text to 'Thorner v Major' which 'serves a useful purpose in outlining the basic form of the doctrine.  Lord Walker, in this particular case, stated the 'scholarly consensus' that proprietary estoppel: 'is based on three elements... a representation on assurance made to the claimant; reliance on it by the claimant; and detriment to the claimant in consequence of his (reasonable) reliance'.\n\nOr,  to over-simplify all this, 'a promise made is a debt unpaid' as the Scots Canadian banker, Robert Service wrote over a century ago in his best-selling verses about the dodgy goings-on during the Klondike gold rush.  Proprietary estoppel, notably the promised-based strand, would have come in pretty handy in those far- off days had it been more widely understood and applied at the time. \n\nOver a century on, the relatively swift evolution of the law of proprietary estoppel is reflected in this book, which seeks to consider, explain and contribute to the emerging commentary on proprietary estoppel.  All aspects of the subject are covered, including remedies, and the wider legal context.\n\nLogically structured, with numbered paragraphs, copious footnotes and extensive tables of legislation and cases, this reliable and authoritative practitioner's reference should certainly be in every practitioner's library.  \n\nThe law has been stated as of 31 July 2013.", "title": "The Law of Proprietary Estoppel", "publishedDate": "2014-03-24T09:15:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Ywvg30G1kI", "description": "Please subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

The initial DS version, released on December 18, 2008 in Japan, was made available in two versions, one with anime-style video scenes, and the other having Pixar-like 3D video scenes. While the video's featured different art styles, the two versions maintained the same story and gameplay. On March 7, 2013, a third version, a remake titled Tales of Hearts R, was released on the PlayStation Vita. In early 2014, it was announced that the Vita version would have an English language release in North America and Europe between Q4 2014 and Q1 2015.\nTales of Hearts follows a similar gameplay structure to other titles in the series. The player visits various towns in which they can talk to various non-playable characters, buy items, and progress the story. \nRecovery Stones replaces the common cooking system of the series. The recovery stone can be set to be used at various times during battle to recover HP, or for other effects. When the stone is used it consumes \"Heal Energy\", which can be recharged at a recovery stone shop, or in dungeons. At the shops the player can also pay to increase the number of effects that can be set to the stone, increase the amount of heal energy, or buy more effects that the recovery stone can use.\nBy going to accessory shops, the player can make different accessories through materials found throughout the game, all with different effects or benefits. Accessories can also be turned back into the materials used to create it for other uses.\nCustomization in the game is handled through the \"Soma Build\" system, through which the player upgrades the Soma (weapons) of the party and control their growth. The player can use raw materials found throughout the game to learn various abilities, or \"Soma Skills\" (of which there are four types: Parameter, Battle, Action, and Support), or to add various stat bonuses to a character.\nWhen Soma Build is performed on a weapon enough times, the weapon can go through a process called \"Soma Evolve\", in which the Soma will take on a new form and name, and unlock new Soma Skills and stat bonuses.\nThroughout the game there are various events in which the player can choose different options towards another character, called a \"Soma Link\". Through certain choices it will cause the outcomes of scenes to change, and the character may gain points towards their \"Soma Link Value\". Once it becomes high enough, the character can learn various skills.\nBy using Soma, the party can go into one's heart, called a \"Spir Link\". The person's mind is like a labyrinth, called a \"Spir Maze\", a place with various rare items and other things to find. There are chances to go into these during both the main scenario and with NPCs throughout the game.\nZerom, monsters that eat individuals 'Spiria' (or 'hearts'), have spread around the world. Therefore weapons called 'Somas', were created in order to banish all Zerom. People who possess Somas manage to enter someone's Spir-Maze or Heart Maze. Amber Hearts, who happens to be the vessel for Richea Spodune, was in search of a Soma together with her brother, Jadeite Hearts. Along the way an enemy, Incarose assaults them, but they manage to escape to the sea. They are brought into a little village of Seeble, where they meet the protagonist, Shing Meteoryte. There Shing took care of both of them and introduced them to the Soma they are looking for.\n\nDuring that time, Incarose makes an appearance once more; this time she manages to attack Amber and Shing's grandfather, Zeks. Since Shing has a Soma he intends to go within Amber's Spir Maze in order to cure her. But, the plan does not go well and Amber's Spiria ends up shattered into pieces and placed everywhere around the world. From there Shing's adventure of recovering Amber's Spiria shards begins. During that time Shing befriends several others and together has to overcome many obstacles and antagonists who are also looking for Spiria. During his travels, Shing discovers more and more about the world, Richea, Spiria, Zerom, etc.\nEventually, it is revealed that Creed Graphite, the ruler of Quartzia, was hidden away within Shing and is eventually drawn out by Incarose. The ancient defense system, Gardenia, is revived, though Creed is shocked at its nature. With the aid of Calcedony and his Spiria, Shing and the party are able to infiltrate Gardenia and defeat Creed, but through sacrifice. As a result, Gardenia is destroyed, and Creed and Flora are killed in the process.", "title": "Secret Dungeon - Tales of Hearts R Soundtrack", "publishedDate": "2014-05-27T18:52:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Z3Gu7NRMeo", "description": "This is a technical demo for face substitution technique.\nKyle McDonalds uses open Frameworks for too-smooth face substitution. \nFace Substitution from Kyle McDonald \nvimeo.com/29348533\nFaceTracker library from Jason Saragih web.mac.com/jsaragih/FaceTracker/FaceTracker.html\nofxFaceTracker addon github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker\nopenFrameworks openframeworks.cc/\nDownload the app here github.com/arturoc/FaceSubstitution\nvimeo.com/29348533\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\nMusic: Funky little nudel by ThomasEwel Thomas Ewel\nkompoz.com/music/collaboration/93190\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "title": "Funny Face Substitution technique", "publishedDate": "2014-01-20T06:03:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Z3NSfLrbbI", "description": "WIR WOLLEN EINEN HIMMEL OHNE CHEMISCHE WOLKEN.

School fee is Kshs.100 per month per child.\n\n    'On school fees payment, few parents are paying but majority are too poor to afford the fees that they resort to doing manual jobs at the school as a form of school fees payment,' Leah says.\n\n    The centre has three classrooms built buy a sponsor that houses the baby, middle and the final classes. Minus an office or an administration block, the three teachers carry out administrative roles from the classes they teach.\n\n    Tests are done at every end of the month so as to keep the children abreast of what they are taught. They use banana fibers, carton boxes, soil, bottle tops, sticks, stones, leaves and flowers as learning materials. Despite the lack of modest learning materials, these children perform exemplary well whenever they are admitted in the nearby primary schools.\n\n    Teachers here perform their duties in the wake of various challenges they encounter on daily basis. They are loaded with work but the salaries' are not always a guarantee. It is true that most ECD teachers draw their salaries from fees paid by children but at St. Paul's; this is hard to come by.\n\n    The fact that the community around is poor and most of the children being orphans and vulnerable does not save the situation either. Due to high poverty levels, some of the children come to class on empty stomachs that make concentration on class work a difficult venture.\n    Mrs. Adipo says that the government of Kenya does not even make an attempt to support ECD Centers. 'If it is possible, let the government pay the teachers' salaries' and buy learning materials for these children,' she appeals.\n\n    A part from academic work, the children at the centre also engage in co-curriculum activities. For the last three years, they have been to the national music festivals under the ECD category. Last year, they were in Mombasa and they emerged fifth nationally with their creative dance.\n\n    Save for entranced poverty, children in this centre are rearing to go; academically and in co-curriculum activities. Any support, however small it can be, will give these kids something worth smiling of.", "title": "Ugunja: poor but not hopeless kids", "publishedDate": "2013-06-05T10:39:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Z58PLhpdvw", "description": "Napoli  castle view", "title": "Napoli  castle  walls and entrenchment view", "publishedDate": "2011-06-27T12:34:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Z5BkDybVWo", "description": "Longueur D'Avance\n\nBooba\nMa\u00eetre Gims\n\n\u2117 2013 Tallac Records\n\nAuthor: Booba\nComposer: Therapy\nMusic Publisher: 2zeros93 Publishing\nMusic Publisher: Because Editions\nMusic Publisher: Tallac Publishing\nMusic Publisher: Warner Chappell Music France\nMusic Publisher: Wati B Edition\n\nAuto-generated by YouTube.", "title": "Longueur D'Avance", "publishedDate": "2014-11-08T21:26:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Z5H8PoQWFo", "description": "The Submariner is my thesis film for the California State University Long Beach film production program.

It was released on April 27, 1997 in Japan, on July 1, 1997 in North America and on October 20, 1997 in Europe and Australia. It was later ported to the China-only iQue on November 21, 2003. Additionally, it is a reimagined remake of the original Star Fox, and the first to be released on the Nintendo 64. It was made available for download on the Wii's Virtual Console on April 2, 2007 in North America, April 17, 2007 in Japan and on April 20, 2007 in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The planned second game in the series for the SNES, Star Fox 2, was canceled due to the upcoming release of the Nintendo 64, but some of its features were used in Star Fox 64, such as all range mode. It was the first game to introduce support for the Rumble Pak. The game received positive ratings from reviewers and critics who praised its smooth animation, detailed visuals, and use of multiple gameplay paths. It has been called one of the greatest games of all time.\n\nRECEPTION:\nStarFox 64 is considered to be the best SF game ever among fans. It also is considered to be the first game in the series, considering the original game not Canon. Many fans were disapointed by the following 2 sequals, but brought up by the 3rd sequal.\n\nLEGACY:\nStar Fox 64 is regarded by many as one of the greatest N64 games of all time, though it is still considered to be in the shadow of more popular games such as The Ocarina of Time and Super Mario 64. Star Fox 64 was also the first game to utilize Nintendo's revolutionary Rumble Pak. It is believed by most fans to be the best game of the series. Also, the repetitive speech of Star Fox 64 is known for has recently become a sort of internet phenomenon, most notably Peppy Hare's infamous, \"Do a barrel roll!\" line.\n\nREFERENCES:\n1.The Katina level is almost a complete rip off/homage to the movie, \"Independence Day\" \n2.Bill Grey is also a homage to a character in the movie's name.\n3.The Sector Y level has many armies of mechs similar to many of the mobile suits from \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" for their beam rifles, shields and mobility. They even can be launched out from battleships in battle. One mech colored in red and is said by Peppy to be very quick reference any mobile suit used by Char Aznable because of its red color and quick mobility. Not only that, the boss however aside from the first two colored mechs is known to be white and launched from its own launch ship is a homage and resemblance to the RX-78-2 Gundam which is also from the same series.", "title": "Star Fox 64 Soundtrack (HD) -  Title Screen", "publishedDate": "2008-02-18T17:46:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Z9Cm92vfQA", "description": "Rock blows out of gyro-crusher, sometimes even the best JSA misses something", "title": "Crusher incident", "publishedDate": "2007-12-03T04:31:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Z9fbnjrpiM", "description": "Feeding my stonefish, and my Eel wanting the food, I do end up feeding the stonefish at the end.\n\nExcuse the lighting, the nocturnal nature of my fish makes it so thats the best I can do for lighting when trying to feed late at night.", "title": "Stonefish and Eel Feeding", "publishedDate": "2011-07-24T06:19:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ZACfYV7YtA", "description": "\u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u044b 24 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430.\u041a\u043b\u0443\u0431 PIPL", "title": "DISTEMPER - \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c", "publishedDate": "2013-09-15T20:16:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ZAJ4KZ-DM0", "description": "http://www.wailingsouls.net  A classic hit by the Wailing Souls - Mr Fire Coal Man was first released in 1971 in the UK on the Banana label, and then subsequently featured on the Wailing Souls' first album 'The Wailing Souls' released in 1975 on the Studio One label.

I\u2019m talking to a lot of people here. I\u2019ve been respectful to you. Now I want you to be respectful to me.\u201d - President Obama Heckled as He Speaks at Del Sol HS - Obama interrupted by hecklers in Las Vegas. Friday while speaking at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas, NV, President Barack Obama was interrupted by screaming immigration activists angry his executive action amnesty does not cover everyone, to which the president replied,\"That's right not everybody will qualify under this provision. That's the truth, that's why we are going to have to pass a bill,\" adding, \"this is just the first step.\"\nObama signs executive orders delaying deportations for millions of illegal immigrants\n(Fox News) President Obama signed two executive orders on Friday that would delay deportation for millions of illegal immigrants. The president, who signed the controversial policies aboard Air Force One, then spoke about his action at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas. \n\nDel Sol is the same school where he laid out his blueprint for immigration overhaul nearly two years ago.\nSeveral hundred protestors lined the streets holding \u201cNo Amnesty\u201d and \u201cImpeach Obama\u201d signs.\nOthers chanted \u201cworst president ever,\u201d as he drove by.\n His order will grant \u201cdeferred action\u201d to two illegal immigrant groups- parents of United States citizens or legal permanent residents who have been in the country for five years, and young people who who were brought into the country illegally as of 2010.\nHispanics are a growing and powerful constituency in Nevada and the state serves as fertile ground for the president to rally public support. \n\nDuring a 15-minute primetime speech Thursday, Obama said his administration will start accepting applications from illegal immigrants who seek the deferred actions.\n\nThose who qualify will be granted protections for three years, Obama said, as he laid out his sweeping plan to the public Thursday night from the East Room of the White House.\n\n\u201cMass amnesty would be unfair,\u201d Obama said during the primetime address. \u201cMass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character.\u201d\n\nObama, who pitched his plan as a \u201ccommonsense, middle ground approach,\u201d said \u201cif you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law\u201d but warned \u201cif you\u2019re a criminal, you\u2019ll be deported.\u201d\n\nThe president did not specify how many in each \"deferred action\" group would be granted the new status. According to recent reports, the parental group could involve upwards of 4.5 million immigrants, with those brought into the country illegally making up close to 300,000 new applications. There are an estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally.\n\nBut Republicans have been quick to criticize and say the executive action is an example of Obama stretching his powers as president.\n\nEven before the speech, conservatives said they were willing to do whatever was necessary to stop Obama\u2019s plan.\n\nKentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, who will become the majority leader in January when the new congressional class is sworn-in, said Obama would regret choosing to ignore the will of the American people.\n\nMcConnell, who made his statements from the Senate floor Thursday morning, has led the charge against the president and has promised a legislative fight when Republicans take full control of Congress in 2015.\n\n\u201cIf President Obama acts in defiance of the people and imposes his will on the country, Congress will act,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nUtah Rep Jason Chaffetz, who will replace Rep. Darrell Issa as chair of the House Oversight Committee, told Fox News that the president\u2019s timing on announcing the plan was \u201ccrystal clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about politics,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cHe just got slaughtered in an election.\u201d\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in an op-ed in Politico Wednesday that if Obama acts, the new GOP majority in the Senate should retaliate by not acting on a single one of his nominees \u2013 executive or judicial \u2013 \u201cso long as the illegal amnesty persists.\u201d\n\n WATCH LIVE: Obama Delivers Immigration Speech in Las Vegas.Obama pushes back at Boehner\u2019s comments this morning:\nI understand that some of them are saying my actions sabotage their ability to pass a bill.\nWhy? I didn\u2019t dissolve parliament. That\u2019s not how our system works. .. They can still vote in Congress. Pass a bill!

Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 (cover-dated Aug. 1962). Lee and Ditko conceived the character as an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and as a teenager, having to deal with the normal struggles of adolescence in addition to those of a costumed crimefighter. Spider-Man's creators gave him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using wrist-mounted devices of his own invention (which he called \"web-shooters\"), and react to danger quickly with his \"spider-sense\", enabling him to combat his foes.\n\n\nThe Spiderman homepage:\nhttp://marvel.com/characters/54/spider-man\n\nMarvel Comics characters:\nhttp://marvel.com/characters\n\n\nLEGO clones or Knockoffs\nThis quote from Wikipedia addresses the rights for other companies to produce LEGO-like bricks, but does not address whether LEGO actually had the right to patent them in the fist place:\nAt least two of the largest clone manufacturers have been challenged in court by Lego. The lawsuits have been mostly unsuccessful, as courts have generally found the functional design of the basic brick to be a matter of patent rather than trademark law, and all relevant Lego patents have expired.\n\nThe original plastic brick:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiddicraft\n\nThe (non-wooden) predecessor to the plastic brick:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minibrix\n \n\n\nBUY MY BOOKS HERE:\nSnapshots In Time\nBuy it at Amazon\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Snapshots-Time-Jim-Griffin/dp/1598585983/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1270349798&sr=1-2\n\n\nThe Book Depository.

On the path of Bhakti, the concept of simple faith has kept this festival alive to date. However, our self-introspection and subtle reflection compels us to ponder over the exactness or truth about this centuries-old devotional celebration. The Sanskrit scholars and great pundits could explain hundreds of interesting stories and mythological events to prove how fruitful it is to have faith and just offer a few leaves of Bel Patras to please Lord Shiva while seeking His blessings on the night of Maha Shivratri... It is further assured that this would reap positive results, and fulfill all materialistic or worldly wishes of becoming rich, experiencing health benefits and even freedom from the Cycle of Rebirth. However, it is a matter yet to be proved right. As per the divine law of cyclic order of this world, and as per God's own promise as enunciated in our scriptures of ancient Bharat, God Shiva descends but once in the cycle of creation to enlighten human beings about His own true identity as well as the truth about His creation. On the basis of the personal experiences of Pitashri Prajapita Brahma in the year 1936 and thereafter, truth  about God's existence and knowledge about His vast, vast creation have been found to be very unique and appealing, resulting in transformation of human outlook and inculcation of spiritual values and divine virtues. On the basis of this Gyan, a beautiful and loving relationship is established between each individual human soul and the Almighty God Shiva that helps divinize human consciousness. When we celebrate the 78th Trimurti Shiva Jayanti on 28th February 2014, we would feel so proud and honoured in sharing the most invaluable secret with one and all: this is the most opportune time to awaken spiritually, and empower ourselves so that we can visualize the self in our true star-like form, and experience divine knowledge and Godly powers as our spiritual inheritance from our Eternal Spiritual Father God Shiva. This simple but most effective way of spiritual communion or Meditation on the light-form of Shiva automatically bestows on us the boons and blessings of God's love, purity, virtues and power. This powerful form of spiritual meditation helps us reconnect with our original selves, so that we naturally cleanse the self of weaknesses/defects and settle karmic accounts in order to experience Mukti (Liberation from Negativity) and Jeevan Mukti (Salvation).The best way to celebrate Maha Shivratri would be to know the difference between God Shiva and the Trimurti angelic creation of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahadev/Shankar. This would automatically dispel the confusion created by the mythological stories about Shankar-Parvati and the other angelic deities. God Shiva is the Bestower of Mukti and Jeevan Mukti to all humankind. Those who are fortunate enough to have recognized, learnt and practiced the same as per the direct revelations by Supreme Father God Shiva through divine visions as well as the spiritual teachings (Murlis), from 1936 to date, can appreciate the Truth, Beauty and Benevolence for which God Shiva is praised and remembered so fondly as \"Satyam - Shivam -Sundaram\". Let us become soul-conscious as star-like beings of eternalspiritual light and might, and remember God Father Shiva, to be worthy of returning to Paramdham (Highest Abode ofGod) and then descending into Golden Age (Satyug) as deities. The daily spiritual practice ofre-affirming our personal relationship with our most beloved Supreme Father would bestow on us the fruit of freedom from Kaliyug's bondages, and empower us with purity and divinity to be worthyof receiving the inheritance of the Golden-Aged Deity Empire. May you receive God Shiva's blessings of Mukti-Jeevan Mukti Sovereignty of the Golden Age!", "title": "Spiritual Significance of Shivratri", "publishedDate": "2014-02-26T13:07:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ZbeS-KGrTY", "description": "A 90-second walk at Birdsong featuring a few flowering plants found near the house: Native azalea, crab apply, red buckeye, cross vine, senecio, and a dogwood growing in the pecan orchard.
