He graduated in arts and law with distinction from the Punjab University. He was awarded PhD by the Punjab University in 1986 on the thesis Punishments in Islam, their classification and philosophy. He took allegiance at the hand of Sayyidina Tahir Ala-ud-Din al-Qadri al-Gilani who groomed him in the mystic way of life and who is his spiritual benefactor. Among his teachers are included his father Dr Farid-ul-Din Qadri, Mawlana Zia-ud-Din Madani, Mawlana Ahmad Saeed Kazmi, Dr Burhan Ahmad Farooqi, Dr Muhammad bin Alawi, all men of high intellectual calibre and scholarly stature. He has delivered thousands of lectures spanning diverse facets of Islam, its religious, spiritual, historical, moral, legal, political, economic, social and scientific aspects and its comparison with other religions. He also delivers lectures at foreign universities on various intellectual and contemporary issues. He has written numerous books in Urdu, English and Arabic to date. Many of his books have been translated into different languages. His lectures are also broadcast from different TV channels in the Western and Arabian world.\n\nMinhaj-ul-Quran International launched by him is thriving now in more than 80 countries of the world. He also laid the foundation of mass education programme (MEP) in Pakistan, which is the greatest educational plan at the unofficial level. His political party, Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), is playing a vital role in national politics by promoting the tradition of tolerance, principle observance and progressiveness in national political culture. He is a unifying symbol of Muslim world and known as an ambassador of peace and human welfare. His intellectual and social contributions to human progress are internationally acknowledged. American Biographical Institute has pronounced him outstanding man of the 20th century and his name has been included in the Millennium Biographical Dictionary as a distinguished intellectual and thinker of the world. Moreover, he is also included among the 500 most effective leaders at the end of the second millennium as recognition of his original research and services to humanity. He was declared 1998-99 personality by the International Biographical Centre, Cambridge as an acknowledgement of his educational and social contributions. In the recent past it is hard to find an individual who has rendered such unprecedented services in such a short span of time for the improvement of the Islamic community through his intellectual and practical struggle.\n\nDr Qadri is, therefore, not an individual but a tradition. He is not only a sensitive interpreter of Islamic values but also a harbinger of the resplendent future of Islam.", "title": "Happy Birthday to Shaykh ul Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir ul Qadri", "publishedDate": "2009-02-14T17:16:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "B2PDe6v33A0", "description": "O caxinguel\u00ea (Sciurus aestuans), tamb\u00e9m chamado de serelepe, \u00e9 uma esp\u00e9cie de esquilo florestal que mede cerca de vinte cent\u00edmetros de comprimento. \u00c9 end\u00eamico da Am\u00e9rica do Sul, podendo ser encontrado no Brasil. \u00c9 o \u00fanico esquilo dos Pampas.

I filmed these two Muscovy ducks in a public park not far from where I live, but these ducks are actually native to Mexico, Central and South America. Like the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) it has also been domesticated and introduced all around the world; and do adapt well to colder climates. Some domesticated ducks have escaped into the wild and now breed outside their native range, including in Western Europe, Canada and the USA. True wild Muscovy ducks are quite different to domesticated ducks. They are blackish, with iridescent green and purple dorsal plumage and with white wing patches. On the head, the male has a short crest on the nape. The bill is black with a speckling of pale pink. A blackish or dark red knob can be seen at the bill base, and the bare skin of the face is similar to that in colour. The eyes are yellowish-brown. The legs and webbed feet are blackish with long claws. The wild female is similar in plumage, but is also much smaller, and she has a feathered face and lacks the prominent knob. The juvenile is duller overall, with little or no white on the upperwing. Domestic Muscovy ducks come in a variety of plumages including chocolate brown, blue or pied (like these two in the video).  The wild Muscovy duck normally inhabits forested swamps, lakes, streams and nearby grassland and farm crops, and often roosts in trees at night. Its diet consists of plant material obtained by grazing or dabbling in shallow water, and small fish, amphibians, reptiles, crustaceans, insects, and millipedes. As I said earlier, I filmed these two Muscovy ducks in the park, one was on the grass and the other was on a picnic table.      \n\nOther Facts\n\nKingdom: Animalia\nPhylum: Chordata\nClass: Aves\nOrder: Anseriformes\nFamily: Anatidae\nScientific Name: Cairina moschata\nLength: 66-84cm\nWingspan: 137-152cm\nWeight: 1.1-4.1kg\nNumber of Eggs: 8-16\nIncubation Period: 33-35 days\nFledging Period: 60-70 days\nLifespan: Up to 20 years\nDistribution: Wild Muscovy ducks exist in Mexico, Central America & South America; whereas feral Muscovy ducks exist in parts of North America & Western Europe.\nConservation Status: Least Concern\n\nAll facts and information are based on what I've researched on the internet or read about in books or heard from other animal experts when I travel to other different countries around the world.", "title": "A.K.5000 Muscovy Duck", "publishedDate": "2012-04-26T12:20:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "B2in92JvLHU", "description": "Choreography by Tommy Chan (Gimmi Dance Studio)\n\nwww.gimmidance.com", "title": "BT Square@The One Dance Competition Final Hip Hop Group 2008", "publishedDate": "2008-08-05T10:56:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "B2inExgT77s", "description": "Neil deGrasse Tyson explains how wealthy is Microsoft founder Bill Gates.

This region is mostly hilly or mountainous. Its topography is dominated by the Apennines to the east, with the highest point in the region at Monte Vettore on the border of the Marche 2,476 m (8,123.36 ft), and the Tiber valley basin, with the lowest point at Attigliano 96 m (314.96 ft). It is the only Italian region which is both landlocked and with no common border with other countries.\nLandscape of Umbria\n\nThe Tiber forms the approximate border with Lazio; although its course northwards from its source just over the Tuscan border lies in Umbria, the river course is changeable and thus few towns have been built on it: the Tiber itself is not a major factor in the history and human geography of Umbria. The same cannot be said of the Tiber's three principal tributaries, each flowing in a generally southward course. The course of the Chiascio takes it through relatively uninhabited areas until Bastia Umbra, and about 10 km later it flows into the Tiber at Torgiano. The Topino, cleaving the Apennines with passes that the Via Flaminia and successor roads follow, makes a sharp turn at Foligno to flow NW for a few kilometres before joining the Chiascio below Bettona. The third river is the Nera, flowing into the Tiber further south, at Terni; its valley, called the Valnerina, is widely considered to be the most scenic area of Umbria. While the upper Nera flows more or less in isolation in the mountains, the lower course of the Chiascio-Topino basin is a fairly large floodplain, which in Antiquity was a pair of shallow, interlocking lakes, the Lacus Clitorius and the Lacus Umber. They were drained by the Romans over several hundred years, but an earthquake in the 4th century and the political collapse of the Roman Empire resulted in the reflooding of the basin, which was drained a second time over five hundred years; Benedictine monks started the process in the 13th century, and it was completed by an engineer from Foligno in the 18th century.\n\nIn tourist literature one sometimes sees Umbria called il cuor verde d'Italia (the green heart of Italy). The phrase, taken from a poem by Giosu\u00e8 Carducci \u2014 the subject of which is not Umbria but rather a specific place in it, the source of the Clitunno river, treasured as a beauty spot \u2014 is to a certain extent appropriate since the modern administrative region is the only one to have neither a coast nor a border with a foreign country, and, except for August and September, is famously green.

Gleichzeitig wird er Ihnen lieber Leser wichtige Handlungsanweisungen vermitteln, die Sie vor Fehltritten bei der Behandlung von Schmerzen im Knie bewahren.\nSchmerzen im Knie sind so ziemlich dass Schlimmste was einem an Schmerzen passieren kann, da sie die Bewegungsf\u00e4higkeit stark einschr\u00e4nken. Gerade f\u00fcr gesundheitsorientierte und sportlich ambitionierte Menschen sind Schmerzen im Knie mit einem starken Verlust an Lebensqualit\u00e4t verbunden. Ich selber habe schon dieses Tal des Lebens durchschritten und m\u00f6chte, dass Sie lieber Leser folgende Fehler bei der Behandlung von Schmerzen im Knie vermeiden:\n\n1.Schmerzen im Knie -- soll ich mich schonen?\n\nSchmerzen im Knie sind ein wichtiger Hinweis, dass die Geometrie im Knie und der Anpressdruck zwischen den Gelenkfl\u00e4chen nicht mehr optimal ist. Es herrscht eine Verschlei\u00dfsituation. Sie sollten jetzt sehr woll Fahrrad fahren, lange Spazierg\u00e4nge und starke Oberschenkelbelastungen meiden. Nur bei der Therapie sollten Sie auf Bewegung und Entspannung und zum Schlu\u00df auf Dehnkr\u00e4ftigung setzen. Hierzu sollten Sie unbedingt \u201edie 7 Schmerzfreistrategien bei Knieschmerzen\" (demn\u00e4chst)erwerben, weil da genau diese Vorgehensweise beschrieben wird.\n\n2.Schmerzen im Knie -- es kommt schnell zu Fehlhaltungen\n\nJe nachdem wie das Knie weh tut und welche Muskeln am meisten verspannt sind kommt es schnell zu Fehlhaltungen im Knie. Das Knie wird zum Beispiel nicht mehr gestreckt bzw. richtig gebeugt und/oder es kommt in eine X bzw. O-Beinstellung. Diese Fehl- bzw. Schonhaltungen gilt es unbedingt zu vermeiden, da sie zu noch mehr Anspannung in der Kniemuskulatur f\u00fchren. In den Alltagstipps f\u00fcr schmerzfreie Knie(jetzt kaufen)erhalten Sie hierzu wichtige Impulse. Melden Sie sich einfach zu dem kostenfreien Newsletter an(kostenlos downloaden -- oben!) und arbeiten Sie dann Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt jede Mitteilung genau durch und setzen Sie sie im Alltag dann um.\n\n3.Schmerzen im Knie -- vermeiden Sie Operationen\n\nOperationen stellen eine endg\u00fcltige Ver\u00e4nderung der Struktur dar!\nOP muss das sein?\n\nEgal ob die Gl\u00e4ttung von Knorpelfl\u00e4chen oder der Einbau eines \nk\u00fcnstlichen Kniegelenks ...\n\nJETZT eintragen und mehr erfahren:  http://knie-schmerzen.info\n\nEin Gelenk (lateinisch articulatio, griechisch \u1f04\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u00e1rthron) aus anatomischer Sicht ist eine bewegliche Verbindung von zwei oder mehreren Knochen.\n\nVerschmelzen diese Knochen, wird von einer Synostose gesprochen. In der Anatomie wird zwischen echten, das hei\u00dft mit einem fl\u00fcssigkeitsgef\u00fcllten Spalt versehenen, und unechten Gelenken unterschieden. Mit einem Pseudogelenk ist dagegen der beweglich gebliebene Knochenbereich nach einem nicht verheilten Knochenbruch gemeint.\n\nVorg\u00e4nge und Erscheinungen im Inneren eines Gelenkes werden als intraartikul\u00e4r bezeichnet (z. B. ist eine intraartikul\u00e4re Injektion eine Verabreichung von Arzneimitteln durch Punktion des Gelenkes). Eine Gelenkspiegelung wird Arthroskopie genannt.\n\nAuszug aus Wikipedia: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelenk\n\nWollen Sie Ihre Schmerzen sofort lindern?

No one knew what existed beyond the fortress of ice rimming the northern oceans, although theories abounded. The foremost cartographer in the world, a German named August Petermann, believed that warm currents sustained a verdant island at the top of the world. National glory would fall to whoever could plant his flag upon its shores. \n\nJames Gordon Bennett, the eccentric and stupendously wealthy owner of The New York Herald, had recently captured the world's attention by dispatching Stanley to Africa to find Dr. Livingstone. Now he was keen to re-create that sensation on an even more epic scale. So he funded an official U.S. naval expedition to reach the Pole, choosing as its captain a young officer named George Washington De Long, who had gained fame for a rescue operation off the coast of Greenland. De Long led a team of 32 men deep into uncharted Arctic waters, carrying the aspirations of a young country burning to become a world power. On July 8, 1879, the USS Jeannette set sail from San Francisco to cheering crowds in the grip of \"\"Arctic Fever.\"\" \n\nThe ship sailed into uncharted seas, but soon was trapped in pack ice. Two years into the harrowing voyage, the hull was breached. Amid the rush of water and the shrieks of breaking wooden boards, the crew abandoned the ship. Less than an hour later, the Jeannette sank to the bottom,and the men found themselves marooned a thousand miles north of Siberia with only the barest supplies. Thus began their long march across the endless ice a frozen hell in the most lonesome corner of the world. Facing everything from snow blindness and polar bears to ferocious storms and frosty labyrinths, the expedition battled madness and starvation as they desperately strove for survival. \n\nWith twists and turns worthy of a thriller, In The Kingdom of Ice is a spellbinding tale of heroism and determination in the most unforgiving territory on Earth.\"", "title": "In the Kingdom of Ice: The Grand and Terrible Polar Voyage of the USS Jeannette [PDF]", "publishedDate": "2014-10-16T19:53:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "B2yFY50Xfms", "description": "Interview of angus,thongs and perfect snogging", "title": "Angus,thongs and perfect snogging Interview 1", "publishedDate": "2008-08-22T13:24:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "B2ySLCGWNA4", "description": "", "title": "Programa Ver Mais   Risoto de lingui\u00e7a com cerveja", "publishedDate": "2013-02-05T17:53:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "B2yZuMSjRfE", "description": "", "title": "Administering eye drops", "publishedDate": "2009-10-29T14:12:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "B2yfVEnECJo", "description": "Watch how to get your new Moto X up and running in no time!", "title": "Activating a New Moto X", "publishedDate": "2013-12-02T18:40:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "B2yiGXd58Jc", "description": "", "title": "Hymenoptera Formicidae Hormigas de los cornizuelos Pseudomyrmex", "publishedDate": "2013-06-07T14:35:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "B2yknOiWeCc", "description": "EMKO ESM-3710-N Digital ON/OFF Temperature Control Device\nESM-3710-N is a temperature control device with the features of PTC or NTC or PT-100 or Fe-Const or NiCr-Ni input, single set, relay or SSR output, selectable heating and cooling function. \n\nEMKO ESM-3710-N Dijital ON/OFF S\u0131cakl\u0131k Kontrol Cihaz\u0131\nESM-3710-N, PTC veya NTC veya PT-100 veya Fe-Const veya NiCr-Ni giri\u015fli , tek setli , r\u00f6le veya SSR \u00e7\u0131k\u0131\u015fl\u0131, se\u00e7ilebilir \u0131s\u0131tma veya so\u011futma fonksiyonlu s\u0131cakl\u0131k kontrol cihaz\u0131", "title": "EMKO Elektronik ESM-3710-N Heating or Cooling Selection", "publishedDate": "2014-06-11T06:47:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "B2yqAiMDWHs", "description": "\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0438 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440.\u041c\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044c.\n\u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u044b\u043b\u044c:http://minecraft-mods.ru/mody/9569-smeltable-gravel-mod-142.html", "title": "Minecraft \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432 #2", "publishedDate": "2012-11-06T07:36:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "B2yvLXQDgAo", "description": "UPDATE: This video is getting to be very old, but was done on Windows XP.

Jonathan Safran Foer: Well, you know, it might not have been true  five years ago, it probably wasn't true 10 years ago or 15 years ago,  but now, most people have some sense of what the factory farm system  is.\u00a0 They might not know the breadth of it, that it's 99% of all of the  meat that's sold in the supermarkets and restaurants. And they might not  know that the, sort of, environmental destruction that results from  it.\u00a0 And they might not even know of the extent of the animal cruelty or  the human health effects.\u00a0 But if you ask most people, you know; do you  think most meat comes from a place you'd like to visit or not?\u00a0 They  would say, probably not.\u00a0 Probably not a good thing. \u00a0 And every day we're given more and more reasons to worry about where our  food comes from.\u00a0 Right now there's an egg recall, half a billion  eggs.\u00a0 There's been e-coli tainted beef a number of times in the last  couple of years, people are dying from it.\u00a0 We now know very, very  firmly that animal agriculture is the number one cause of global  warming, and yet very few people, including people who are normally  quite political and quite moral and moralizing, talk about it.\u00a0 And even  fewer people act on their concerns about where food comes from.\u00a0 And I  think it's because food is not just fact and it's not just reason; it's  culture, it's personal identity, it's what our parents and our  grandparents fed us.\u00a0 How we think of ourselves, how we want to think of  ourselves, and it's always attached to some kind of a story.\u00a0 And that  confuses things.\u00a0 The Thanksgiving turkey confuses things.\u00a0 The  Christmas ham confuses things.\u00a0 Every family has its own version. \u00a0 But what we need is a different way of talking about meat that is itself  a story.\u00a0 It's not an argument or a work of journalism, but something  that involves this messiness of being human beings and that is what I  tried to do with this book. Question: What responsibilities do we each have a modern individuals?Jonathan Safran Foer: Well I think different people feel these  responsibilities differently.\u00a0 So somebody who is very active in  environmental causes might think about meat in a way that's different  than an animal lover or a pet lover would.\u00a0 And that person might feel  about meat differently than a doctor would.\u00a0 But what we can say is that  Greenpeace doesn't serve meat anymore at of its functions, Al Gore has  advocated eating less meat.\u00a0 The United Nations has said that animal  agriculture is one of the top two or three causes of every significant  environmental problem on the planet.\u00a0 The Union of Concerned Scientists  and the Center for Disease Control has said that we need to stop raising  animals in the way that we are because it's making antibiotics less  effective and also propagating Swine Flu and Avian flu and anyone who  knows anything about how animals are treated is repulsed by it.\u00a0 It  doesn't take being an animal lover.\u00a0 I myself am not an animal lover.\u00a0 I  don't particularly care for chickens to be honest, or cows or pigs.\u00a0  But there are some things that are sort of below the line of very basic  human decency and the farm system that we have is.\nRecorded on August 26, 2010Interviewed by Max Miller", "title": "We Need a New Narrative About Eating Animals", "publishedDate": "2011-06-14T19:05:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "B36EoEuKjVg", "description": "Methane from melting perma-frost", "title": "Farting ice", "publishedDate": "2007-12-25T22:55:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "B36FDVEG_UM", "description": "Burberry Check Belt Unboxing", "title": "Burberry Check Belt Unboxing", "publishedDate": "2013-05-05T23:30:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "B36Fbwpn-rE", "description": "Southern Painted Turtle laying eggs at 500% normal speed", "title": "turtleegg500.avi", "publishedDate": "2012-04-11T02:26:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "B36LSDr46e8", "description": "Before he can mate with a female, this young stallion has to prove he has the right stuff ... he may need to fight off her dad.\n\nWorld's Deadliest: Animal Battles\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/wild/episodes/animal-battles/", "title": "World's Deadliest - Zebra vs. Zebra", "publishedDate": "2012-09-17T15:29:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "B36NiLOAtdM", "description": "http://www.livefrommemphis.com\nOne of Memphis' biggest problems continues to be its bicycle unfriendliness.

But, as usual in this city, where the powers-that-be have failed, the grassroots take the lead.\n\nRevolutions Community Bicycle Shop was founded in June of 2002 with the mission to promote the most energy efficient form of transportation known to science. From the weekend pedaler to the worker looking for a cheap commute, the shop has helped more than 1,500 people build or rehab a bike to fit their needs.

A pesar de que la coreograf\u00eda se interrumpe para dar paso al video y no interact\u00faan, es un bello elemento integral de una pieza que habla del autoconocimiento, del saber morir y renacer. \nLa iluminaci\u00f3n de Andr\u00e9s Poirot, comparte el protagonismo con la int\u00e9rprete, porque tiene el  rol de interlocutor con ese ser a quien ayuda a desenvolver  sus capacidades hasta  el punto de una explosi\u00f3n lum\u00ednica y energ\u00e9tica; misma que podr\u00eda dar paso al reinicio del ciclo.\nFue as\u00ed como arranc\u00f3 este a\u00f1o en Valpara\u00edso,   11o.

So where was the raven haired gentleman with the voice of an angel? Well, 1D fans were quick as per the usual hitting social media to show their concern for Zayn, and while Liam told the audience that Zayn was just out due to a \u201ctummy bug\u201d AKA a bit of the flu, Today Show host Matt Lauer followed up a hard hitting question straight out the gate: \nThe guys did a really good job of handling the tough question and we know that Zayn does not want to be missing this HUGE album launch day so we\u2019re guessing he\u2019s gotta be pretty sick. So without further ado, here are quick looks at Harry, Liam, Louis and Niall performing (in this order) Best Song Ever, Little Things, a new song from Four titled Night Changes and then last we\u2019ve got story of my life. \nTalk about amazing! And I didn\u2019t even mention the fact that there were 15 thousand lucky fans at Universal Orlando who got to witness this awesomeness in person and I loved that the guys arrived in straight-up style in a boat\u2026who else do you know that gets a water entrance \u2013 that like George Clooney status people. And now you know we\u2019ve got to hear from you \u2013 first off, what did you think of Matt Lauer\u2019s question about Zayn?

The hydro electric generating unit comprises a plurality of hydroelectric generators. Each hydroelectric generator comprises a pipeline. A synchronization permanent magnet generator and a hydraulic turbine are arranged inside each pipeline. The synchronization permanent magnet generator is fixed in the pipeline through a plurality of hollow fixing pipes. A cable penetrating outlet used for penetrating through a synchronization permanent magnet generator cable is arranged on a junction of one of the fixing pipes above the synchronization permanent magnet generator and a pipeline wall. The cable penetrating outlet is provided with a grid-connection frequency converter and a protective control device. Due to the synchronization permanent magnet generator, a synchronization magnetizing exciter control device is eliminated by the generator. Due to usage of the grid-connection frequency converter, grid-connection of a generator unit is simple, unit rotate speed is not limited in a certain rotate speed range, a speed regulating device can be canceled, and a generating auxiliary system is simplified. Therefore, the structure of the generator is simple, a large amount of civil engineering cost and device cost is saved, and popularization in the market is facilitated.\n\nSee more at:\nhttp://tonchev.net \nhttp://starton.biz \nhttp://b2b.bg \nhttp://tonchev.org \nhttp://greenclips.eu\nhttp://eldrive.eu", "title": "Inclined shaft multistage axial flow hydrokinertic turbines performs better", "publishedDate": "2013-08-17T16:56:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "B3ZEhqqZusk", "description": "\"The Mongolian Live Sessions: \u0428\u0438\u043d\u044d \u04af\u0435\"\n\nProject Director/ Creator: Reghu Rn (ProSound Studio)\n\u0418\u0432\u044d\u044d\u043d \u0442\u044d\u0442\u0433\u044d\u0433\u0447: \u041d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0448\u043d http://www.ncg.mn\n                      Unitel http://www.unitel.mn\n                      Turkish Airlines\n                      SBN TV http://www.sbn.mn\n\nthe mongolian live sessions, the mongolian live session, mongolian live sessions, mongolian live session, live session, live sessions, mongolian live, \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b \u0430\u043c\u044c\u0434 \u0445\u04e9\u0433\u0436\u0438\u043c, \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b \u0430\u043c\u044c\u0434 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043b\u043e\u043b\u0442, \u0430\u043c\u044c\u0434 \u0445\u04e9\u0433\u0436\u0438\u043c, \u0430\u043c\u044c\u0434 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043b\u043e\u043b\u0442, \u0428\u0438\u043d\u044d \u04af\u0435, Shine Ue", "title": "The Mongolian Live Sessions - \u0428\u0438\u043d\u044d \u04af\u0435: \u0410\u043d\u0445\u0430\u0430 - 73", "publishedDate": "2013-11-12T14:29:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "B3ZNf6-SDZA", "description": "\u25b6 #UE4: Benchmarks: http://on.pcgh.de/1nGlS0Q\n\u25b6 Channel abo: http://on.pcgh.de/1ly7w2f\n\u25b6 Amazon: http://on.pcgh.de/1nZX6qQ\nWie realistische Raumdarstellung in der Unreal Engine 4 aussieht, pr\u00e4sentiert die Tech-Demo aus den Entwicklertools der Engine.

Flomax does so by relaxing sphincter muscles,\nbut even when it does work that is just storing up problems for the future.\nThe prostate will continue to enlarge, and be subject to inflammation and infection.\nThe Flomax drug is an alpha blocker. There are many other brands of alpha blockers but they all suffer from the same kinds of side effects as Flomax.\nDo yourself a favour. Follow my recommendations and your side effects will simply disappear.\nThere are natural nutrients that work in an entirely different way.\nInstead of relaxing muscles, they reduce inflammation, help the body to attack the infection, calm and soothe the prostate and help it to reduce reduce it's size.\nIn other words it is possible to go to the source of the problem and eliminate the or significantly improve the symptoms but it does so by dealing with the cause not the symptoms.\nThe natural supplement that I'm referring to is called total health for the prostate and contains 28 natural ingredients that are not drugs and therefore do not cause and side-effects.\nTo see optimal results make a few changes to your diet and lifestyle. In order to know what those changes are and why you need to make them, you can read about that in my 100 page guide \"All about the Prostate\"\nIf you have not yet taken Flomax or if you have stopped Flomax, just try total health for the prostate. Many thousands of men have confirmed that the results are a revelation. You can read many of their comments on my website.\nIf you buy three bottles which will last you three months, you will also receive a free complimentary copy of my guide which normally costs $49\nYou can read all about Total health and also see the 28 ingredients at the following link. https://www.bensprostate.com/total-health/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=flomax-side-effects-in-men&utm_campaign=video-marketing\nIf you are already and experiencing the side-effects, it is important not to stop  Flomax suddenly because going cold turkey can cause problems.\nContinue to take Flomax but start taking total heath at the same time. Read my guide and make as many of my recommended changes as you can.\nBoth taking the supplements and changing your diet are important. After doing this for 30 days, you can begin to reduce the amount of Flomax you are taking.\nInstead of taking one tablet per day, reduce it to taking one every two days for the next 20 days. If that reduction does not cause you any problems, continue to reduce to taking one tablet every three days for the next 15 days.\nIf you have no problems then you can cease taking Flomax. If, at any time during this process you do get problems, then extend the process of reduction for a longer period.\nIf you have found this video useful pleas click the like button and might like to leave a comment. Thank you for listening and I hope to see you in some of my other videos. Goodbye for now.\n\nFor collaborations and business inquiries, please contact via Channel Pages: http://ChannelPages.com/BenOng12", "title": "Flomax Side Effects & The Natural Alternative To Flomax", "publishedDate": "2012-02-22T12:31:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "B3aDUsXS5Xo", "description": "", "title": "Big City Orchestra - Weltanschauung", "publishedDate": "2013-09-20T13:03:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "B3aH4AlwxaM", "description": "Coxsackie Boat luanch docks get taken out", "title": "Coxsackie Docks", "publishedDate": "2011-09-01T19:40:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "B3aNypciC-k", "description": "Red-necked grebes filmed at a small lake in Alberta.", "title": "Red necked Grebes (Podiceps grisegena)", "publishedDate": "2013-09-15T17:58:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "B3aZMSQct9w", "description": "A baby which was 15 weeks old when its mother was declared brain-dead was delivered by Caesarean section at 27 weeks, after doctors kept the mother alive on life support.\nThe Hungarian doctors who delivered the baby in July believe the birth is one of only three such cases in the world.The family has asked for privacy and has not released the identity or sex of the baby.\n\nDead Woman Gives Birth-\nhttp://dailym.ai/1gKylgv\n\nSnapchat turns down 3 billion dollars-\nhttp://dailym.ai/HVmo9o\n\nGinger kid kills himself-\nhttp://dailym.ai/HVjWQc\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad--------------------\n\nDonate To Charity Water-\nhttp://my.charitywater.org/landonproduction-gives-water-\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConnect With Me:\n\nFacebook-\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Landonproduction/268626033166262?ref=hl\n\nInstagram-\nhttp://instagram.com/landonproductions\n\nTwitter-\nhttps://twitter.com/LandonYoutube", "title": "Dead Woman Gives Birth - Most Amazing Birth", "publishedDate": "2013-11-14T22:09:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "B3au3aKU4oE", "description": "Intralipid infusion is used to reverse a period of bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest in a rat model.

The shapes differ from the almost cylindrical to the barrel. The manner of stretching the hide over the mouths and lacing also varies. It suspended from the neck, tied to the waist and kept on the lap or the ground, and usually played with wooden sticks. The left side is coated to give it a heavier sound. Drum beats are an integral part of Durga Puja.\n\nDurga Puja  also referred to as Durgotsava or Sharadotsav is an annual Hindu festival in South Asia that celebrates worship of the Hindu goddess Durga. It refers to all the six days observed as Mahalaya, Shashthi, Maha Saptami, Maha Ashtami, Maha Navami and Vijayadashami. The dates of Durga Puja celebrations are set according to the traditional Hindu calendar and the fortnight corresponding to the festival is called Devi Paksha. Devi Paksha is preceded by Mahalaya, the last day of the previous fortnight Pitri Paksha, ('Fortnight of the Forefathers'), and is ended on Kojagori Lokkhi Puja.\n\nDurga Puja is widely celebrated in the Indian states of Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Tripura and West Bengal, where it is a five-day annual holiday. In West Bengal and Tripura, which has a majority of Bengali Hindus, it is the biggest festival of the year. Not only is it the biggest Hindu festival celebrated throughout the state, it is also the most significant socio-cultural event in Bengali society. Apart from eastern India, Durga Puja is also celebrated in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. Durga Puja is also celebrated as a major festival in Nepal and in Bangladesh all over the places of Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Bogra and other major places and all the villages of Bangladesh where the 20% population is Hindu.3 day National Holiday is being declared and most of the educational institutions remain closed as it is one of the major national festival also in Bangladesh which is widely celebrated and peoples from all religion participate in the program.\n\nThe prominence of Durga Puja increased gradually during the British Raj in Bengal. After the Hindu reformists identified Durga with India, she became an icon for the Indian independence movement. In the first quarter of the 20th century, the tradition of Baroyari or Community Puja was popularised due to this. After independence, Durga Puja became one of the largest celebrated festivals in the whole world.\n\nDurga Puja also includes the worship of Shiva, who is Durga's consort (Durga is an aspect of Goddess Parvati), in addition to Lakshmi, Saraswati with Ganesha and Kartikeya, who are considered to be Durga's children. Worship of mother nature is done, through nine types of plant (called \"Kala Bou\"), including a plantain (banana) tree, which represent nine divine forms of Goddess Durga. Modern traditions have come to include the display of decorated pandals and artistically depicted idols (murti) of Durga, exchange of Vijaya greetings and publication of Puja Annuals.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\nSource: Wikipedia\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

So, the term \"Cardiology\" means the study of (suffix) the heart (root).\n\nIf you enjoy this video from MedTerms4Fun, please like us.

For one thing, it will definitely save time. For others though, the cheaper route is better as every cost incurred when raising chicken will always add to the cost of every head of chicken produced. Besides, there is really a definite satisfaction when you build and design your own chicken house. If the do-it-yourself chicken house is the route for you, the following will be helpful.\n\nThe Layout - The key point is that chicken houses are places of shelter. As chicken are creatures of habit, the chicken coop must be a permanent safe retreat for chickens where they can roost, nest, feed, and stay healthy safely. A chicken coop will also need a chicken run. Chicken runs are the area outside of the coop where the chicken could roam about, forage for additional nutrition, play, and have dirt baths. The chicken run will depend much on the available space or local regulations. Generally, rural area regulations are relaxed followed by urban areas with strong farming backgrounds. Whether the dirt run is free range, confined, or fenced will vary on the type of predators that are in the area. \n\nThe Design - Typically, a chicken will need about four square feet of space and three hens could share a nest. Each hen will also need a perch about 9\" long. The design should also include a hatchway, storage area, ventilation, lighting and a feeder system. For a cleaner and healthier environment, design the floor to accommodate deep litter. This is normally done by piling three to four inches of wood shavings under the floor. Most people will design or make allowances for a feeder and water container and supply system, often though it is convenient to purchase the system in a local farm supply store. \n\nThe Materials - You will need 4x4 wood for corner posts/studs and skids\n\n\u2022 For boundary and floor joist, framing for walls and roofs you need 4x2's.\n\n\u2022 2x3 will be needed for perch support and perch and a 2x2 for the nesting perch. \n\n\u2022 Plywood will be needed in building wall cladding, flooring, cladding battens, doorstops, parts of nest boxes, roofing and litter boards, and tarpaper for under roofing.\n\n\u2022 Hardware\n\n\u2022 Feeder system\n\nTips for Building the Chicken House\n\nChickens have virtually no defense against predators. Due to this, the do-it-yourself chicken house must be built in such a way that even when there are boards or planks for flooring, it will still be wise to add chicken wires under the floor to discourage rodents from entering the coop as they could easily chew through the wood. Possible weak points and entry points should be wrapped with chicken wire as well.\n\nThe perimeter fence of the chicken run must be constructed in a manner that the fence goes deep into the ground (about 10\") to discourage predators from digging. The height of the fence must be about five feet in height to prevent foxes from jumping over. \nhttp://build-your-own-coop.com", "title": "How To Build A Chicken Coop for Under $100 - DIY Chicken Coop Plans", "publishedDate": "2010-05-05T17:58:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "B3ofZAaLRZs", "description": "7th place winner", "title": "Galax 2013 Hawkins Co.

De familie telt 47 soorten.[1] Hoewel de snavel van de toekan doet denken aan die van neushoornvogels, zijn deze dieren toch niet nauw aan elkaar verwant.De toekan wordt tussen de 30 en 60 centimeter hoog. De vleugels zijn relatief kort en de staart is tamelijk lang. Zijn rugveren zijn glanzend zwart en vaak heeft hij op zijn borst een bontgekleurd verenpak. De poten zijn gebouwd zoals die van de specht, met twee tenen naar voren en twee tenen naar achteren gericht. Mannetjes en vrouwtjes zien er hetzelfde uit.\nHet meest opvallende kenmerk van de toekan is de grote maar toch vederlichte veelkleurige snavel, die soms half zo lang is als het dier zelf, maar meestal ongeveer een derde van zijn lichaamslengte bedraagt. Deze snavel bestaat uit hoorn, dat wordt gestut door een netwerk van bot. Volgens wetenschappers in Science fungeert de enorme snavel als een koelsysteem, net als de oren van een olifant. Ze ontdekten dat de temperatuur van de snavel snel verandert als de omgeving warmer of koeler wordt. Zo kan de toekan snel overtollige lichaamswarmte kwijtraken. Bovendien kan de toekan met zijn snavel een lelijke houw toebrengen, maar ook vogels met veel kleinere snavels zijn daartoe in staat. Vaak hebben vogels een snavel die is toegesneden op het voedsel dat het dier eet. De snavel van de toekan, die zich voornamelijk voedt met kleine vruchten, heeft inderdaad de juiste lengte, maar is veel te groot om bij het eten veel voordeel te bieden.", "title": "2010-06 Costa Rica toekan Wim Peters.mp4", "publishedDate": "2010-12-21T12:27:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "B3qdxR1S0a0", "description": "Check out all the best from Alonzo Mourning as he is inducted into the Hall of Fame!\n\nAbout the NBA: \nThe NBA is the premier professional basketball league in the United States and Canada.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5.

She takes a trip to California, where she stages, or interns, at several restaurant kitchens, including Tartine Bakery and Chez Panisse. \n\nCathy Erway is an author and food writer living in Brooklyn.

So I was in San Francisco for a month and I really wanted to stage at Tartine Bakery. And they were doing some renovations. They were like, \"Yeah, come back tomorrow.\" \"Okay, yeah, I'll come back to tomorrow.\" I was like, \"Shoot.\"\n\nSo I went around town asking to stage other places, and in one case, it was actually like a no-brainer. I was sitting at a bar, having a beer, and then somebody walked in wearing a chef's coat and sat down and like drank a beer in like 5 seconds and then got up and was about to leave to go back to cook. And I was like, \"Oh, what restaurant?\" He's like, \"Oh, this place in SoMa district and,\" you know, he described it, and I was like, \"Can I come cook sometime?\" He's like, \"Yeah, sure.\" And it was great. And then I made some friends or I had some friends in the area, who very graciously -- I think that it's a small world or in the food scenes, I don't know, but he knew everybody. So he hooked me up with a stage opportunity at Chez Panisse, which was pretty amazing. Loved it.\n\nErik Michielsen:  What did you learn?\n\nCathy Erway:  Well, I feel like I have a good sense of the differences of California cuisine and New York cuisine. They use so many herbs, it's insane. Like going into their walk-in, there's like a whole walk-in just for herbs. And there's like drawers of like every single kind of herb. Chervil? Who uses chervil in New York City? I don't know of too many. But they all have this. And sometimes salads are just like simply a pile of beautifully fluffy fresh herbs. And I mean, they're lucky they can grow it anywhere. It's temperate. They have it all year round, you know, kind of spoiled, right? But, yeah, I mean, that's -- and that's naturally what they cook with, you know, all these--you know, sometimes wild fennel because it grows everywhere, we used that -- and oh, Chez Panisse, there was a great dish where they pounded the wild fennel in this mortar and pestle.\n\nChez Panisse is really into using archaic instruments too. At one point, we were pounding roasted red peppers with the mortar and pestle and I was like, \"Why aren't we using a food processor?\" But that's -- you know... It's all about doing things by hand.\n\nErik Michielsen:  And what questions did you ask?\n\nCathy Erway:  Aside from \"Why don't we use a food processor?\"  I don't -- I didn't really want to ask too many questions. I like the idea of being silent and being told what to do and just doing something manually for a long time. I think that's a good intern at a restaurant--just listen, just zone out and like listen to everything that's going on.", "title": "Learning Cooking Skills Staging in Restaurant Kitchens", "publishedDate": "2012-04-17T00:59:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "B4lRs2Lgk0w", "description": "A game of washing machine baseball with a car losing a tire then jumping off a big hill climb", "title": "Tire falls off washing machine baseball and cliff jump with car", "publishedDate": "2014-03-30T22:18:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "B4myZfczRs0", "description": "Cr: kicchi2000,SMTOWNSNSD,Secret Garden", "title": "[140427] TAENY Moment @ fukuoka .", "publishedDate": "2014-05-06T05:42:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "B4mzX0pXwig", "description": "\u092e\u0939\u093e\u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940\u092f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0939\u0930\u0940 \u0905\u092a\u0930\u093e\u0927 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0936\u093e\u0916\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0941\u0916 \u090f\u0938\u090f\u0938\u092a\u0940 \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0915\u0930 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0940\u0932\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0939\u0930\u0940\u0938\u0901\u0917 \u0917\u0941\u0923\u094d\u0921\u093e \u0928\u093e\u0908\u0915\u0947 \u091a\u0930\u0940\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0917\u094b\u0932\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941 \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u093f\u091c\u0928\u094d\u092f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0923 \u0930\u0939\u0947\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0928\u0940\u0924\u093f\u0915 \u0906\u0930\u094b\u092a \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094b\u092a\u0915\u094b \u091f\u093f\u0915\u093e\u091f\u093f\u092a\u094d\u092a\u0923\u0940 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0937\u094d\u091f \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u092d\u090f\u0915\u094b \u091b \u0964 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0940\u0932\u0947 \u091a\u0930\u0940\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0917\u094b\u0932\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0939\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094b \u0928\u093f\u092f\u0924 \u0928\u0930\u0939\u0947\u0915\u094b \u092a\u0928\u093f \u091c\u093f\u0915\u093f\u0930 \u092a\u0928\u093f \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u092d\u090f\u0915\u094b \u091b \u0964\nNEWS24 TELEVISION,KATHMANDU,NEPAL\nSUBSCRIBE : WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/NEWS24TVCHANNEL\nWEBSITE : WWW.NEWS24NEPAL.TV", "title": "DINESH ADHIKARI(CHARI) ENCOUNTER,SSP PUSKAR KARKI BYTE-NEWS24 TV", "publishedDate": "2014-08-08T11:21:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "B4n5akTDPL4", "description": "Exercise balls take tension out of your workout.

Watch the behind the scenes in the link below!\nhttp://youtu.be/cCuNmFRlBMI\n\nI had the chance to film a series of extreme stunt videos with Ford! For this video they gave me a Ford Focus ST, and one tank a gas, to see what adventure we could go on. With this one we got some pro long boarders, and took over a mountain for the day!\n\nWe are still looking for awesome ideas of what to do for the rest of our Ford adventures. Upload to instagram you idea/adventure of what you would do with one tank of gas, and hopefully I can use your idea for one of our next videos. Hashtag on instagram #onetankadventure and I'll be looking back to be inspired for our next video!\n\nThe Focus ST used in this video can be found in this link below!\nhttp://www.ford.com/cars/focus/\n\nThe long boarders were able to reach up to 65mph. And the course we filmed on was closed off to keep everyone safe, so do not try this at home, or on the road for that matter.\n\nMusic in the video is by my friends, and amazing musicians, Scott & Brendo. The song is called \"Carry On\". Here's a link to download it off iTunes.\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/carry-on-single/id660259159\n\nThe athletes/longboarders in the video are Trevor Ovenden, Riley Irvine, Ty Gregg, and Micah Green.\n\nAll the aerial videography was done by my friend Chris Newman!\nYou can contact them in the links below! :)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/cinechopper\nhttp://www.cinechopper.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/cinechopper\n\nFilm by Devin Graham\nProducer: Buddy Enright\nEdited by Parker Walbeck\nSound design by my friend Dan Pugsley.

I'm Jeanie Tse, and I'm here to talk to you about what schizophrenia is. Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that affects about 1 percent of the population. It's a disease like other diseases. There are changes in the development of the brain that affect how people think, how people perceive things, and affect how they behave. \n\nThe symptoms of schizophrenia fall into five domains. One is delusions, so sometimes people with schizophrenia feel like something is happening that other people don't perceive. So, what we say is that they have a fixed false belief that is not shared by other people of their same culture. \n\nSo, that can include being paranoid, being afraid that people are out to get them, or having grandiose delusions, which include feeling that they're on a special mission or perhaps religious delusions, like they're Jesus Christ and so forth. So, that's delusions. \n\nThe second symptom area is hallucinations, so sometimes people with schizophrenia perceive things that other people don't perceive. They hear voices that other people don't hear or see things other people don't see. You can also have hallucinations that affect the sense of smell or the sense of taste or touch as well. \n\nThe third symptom area, and fourth, are disorganized thought and disorganized behavior. So, people with schizophrenia might not be able to care for themselves. They may not be able to plan ahead and keep the steps of something that they need to do in order. \n\nSo, they start to have poor hygiene and not be able to manage their finances or their living circumstances. Disorganized thought comes in the form of people not being able to understand their speech. All the ideas are jumbled together and confusing. \n\nSo, those are the first four symptom areas of schizophrenia, and the fifth is negative symptoms, and sometimes we miss these. But, they're some of the most difficult symptoms of schizophrenia, in that people sometimes don't have motivation to do things. They don't have a lot of thoughts coming through and so they're very quiet. They sit for long periods of time not doing things, and this can be actually one of the more disabling parts of schizophrenia. \n\nBut, recovery from schizophrenia is possible. With treatment and with support, people with schizophrenia can lead normal lives, can work, have families, and pursue the goals that are important to them. That's why the work that all of us in the mental health field do to help people with schizophrenia is so rewarding to us.", "title": "How to Understand Schizophrenia | Schizophrenia", "publishedDate": "2013-08-19T05:46:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "B4yfEswu1LE", "description": "You can see this ring and other eBay auctions selling daily right here at:http://stores.ebay.com/certifiedjewelry\nIf you are interested in this item please contact us at: support@certjewelry.com\n\nWelcome to Certified Jewelry....

In this study, we have examined the capacity of Cu, a nuclei- and DNA-associated transition metal, to mediate the oxidation of TBHQ. In phosphate buffered saline (PBS), autooxidation of TBHQ to TBQ was not detectable, while Cu(II) at micromolar concentrations strongly catalyzed the oxidation of TBHQ to TBQ. Oxidation of TBHQ by Cu(II) was accompanied by the utilization of O2 and the concomitant generation of H2O2. Using electron spin resonance spectroscopy, it was observed that Cu(II) mediated the one electron oxidation of TBHQ to a semiquinone anion radical. The formation of a semiquinone anion radical, the utilization of O2 and the generation of H2O2 and TBQ could be completely blocked by bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS) and reduced glutathione (GSH), two Cu(I)-chelators. 4-Pyridyl-1-oxide-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN)-spin trapping experiments showed that the reaction of TBHQ with Cu(II) resulted in the generation of POBN-CH3 and POBN-CH(OH)CH3 adducts in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethanol, respectively, suggesting the formation of hydroxyl radical or a similar reactive intermediate. The formation of POBN-CH3 adduct from the TBHQ/Cu(II)+DMSO could be completely inhibited by catalase, GSH or BCS, indicating that the hydroxyl radical or its equivalent is generated from the interaction of H2O2 with Cu(I). Incubation of supercoiled \u03c6X-174 plasmid DNA with the TBHQ/Cu(II) resulted in extensive DNA strand breaks, which could be prevented by catalase or BCS. Incubation of rat hepatocytes with TBHQ in PBS led to increased formation of 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in nuclear DNA. The TBHQ-induced formation of 8-OHdG was markedly reduced in the presence of cell permeable Cu(I)-specific chelator, bathocuproine or neocuproine, suggesting that a Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox mechanism may also be involved in the induction of oxidative DNA damage by TBHQ in hepatocytes. Taken together, the above results conclusively demonstrate that the activation of TBHQ by Cu(II) results in the formation of TBQ, semiquinone anion radical and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and that the ROS formed may participate in oxidative DNA damage in both isolated DNA and intact cells. These reactions may contribute to the carcinogenicity as well as other biochemical activities observed with BHA in animals. \n\n\"To our knowledge this study provides the first evidence that endogenous cellular Cu may be capable of bioactivating TBHQ, leading to oxidative DNA damage in cultured cells.\"\n\nRepent Now The Last Days are at hand, turn away from your sins and call on the name of Jesus Christ.", "title": "McChicken Nugget Rage.

It is mostly arboreal and is commonly sighted in pairs. They have grey feathers all over the body with a light grey or dull white belly. The horn is black or dark grey with a casque extending up to the point of curvature in the horn. They are one of the few hornbill species found within urban areas in many cities where they are able to make use of large avenue trees. \n\nThe Indian Grey Hornbill is a medium-sized hornbill, measuring around 61 cm (24 in) in length. The upperparts are greyish brown and there is a slight trace of a pale supercilium. The ear coverts are darker. The flight feathers of the wing are dark brown and whitish tipped. The tail has a white tip and a dark subterminal band. They have a red iris and the eyelids have eyelashes. The casque is short and pointed. The male has a larger casque on a dark bill while the culmen and lower mandible are yellowish. The bare skin around the eye is dark in the male while it is sometimes pale reddish in females. The female has a more yellowish bill with black on the basal half and on the casque.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Each year seat belts save about 13,000 in the U.S.\n\nWhen children are at school ...\n\nEvery $1 invested in early education and quality care has up to a $13 return in future costs.\n\nAnd when you are at work ...\n\nEvery $1 invested in an effective workplace safety program may save $4 to $6 in avoided illnesses, injuries, and fatalities.\n\nWhen you're on the move ...\n\nEvery $1 invested in biking and walking opportunities can return benefits up to $11.80.\n\nEvery $1 invested in food and nutrition education has a $10 return in reduced health care costs\n\nGet your checkup ... \n\nChildhood immunizations save $9.9 million in direct health care costs, saves 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million cases of disease. \n\nAnd while you enjoy your free-time ...\n\nFor every $1 spent on providing tobacco cessation programs the potential ROI is $1.26. In one year the U.S. could save $711 million.\n\nIf 10 percent of adults began regularly walking, $5.6 billion in heart disease costs would be averted.\n\nPublic health is a return on investment: Prioritize public health funding.\n\nNational Public Health Week is April 1-7.

This course does include, but is not limited to, needling of taut bands of muscle (i.e. trigger points) as originally introduced by Travell & Simons. That is, peri-neural needling and needle puncture of tendons, ligaments, musculotendinous junctions, teno-osseus junctions, and bone (i.e. \"periosteal pecking\") will also be taught as essential components of musculoskeletal needling practice. More specifically, peri-neural and peri-vascular needling will be instructed for the purpose of improving microcirculation and disrupting fibrosis in chronic neurogenic pain conditions (e.g. an impacted median nerve in carpal tunnel syndrome).

Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with many more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.\n\nGreat Anaconda devours leopard but she can't digest it", "title": "Great Anaconda devours leopard but she can't digest it", "publishedDate": "2014-07-10T13:27:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5Pk84suq74", "description": "desain mesin pengering kopi tipe putar More details: http://pakistancrushers.com/contact.php\nGet the price of machines: http://pakistancrushers.com/contact.php\nSBM as one of the largest mining and crushing equipments manufacturers and vendors all over the world, we provide cone crusehr, jaw crusher, grinding mill, mobile crusher, ball mill, washer machine, vibrating screen, belt conveyor, etc for quarry plant to process iron, gold, aggregate, artificial sand, limestone, asphalt, ballast, bauxite, brick, cement, ceramic, clay, concrete, construction, glass, gypsum, kaolin, coke, coal, barite, bentonite, clinker, dolomite, earth, feldspar, fluorspar, fly ash, garnet, graphite, gravel, marble, talc, mica, perlite, porcelain, pozzolana, quartz, rubble, salt, silica, slate, soapstone, soda, sizing, bottle, aluminum, antimony, calcium, chrome, copper, diamond, hematite, Lead, lithium, magnesium, magnetite, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, pyrite, anthracite,etc.\nThe quarry plant capacity from 100tpd to 2000t/h .\nSBM company provide quarry plant machine for India, Oman, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Amercia, Indonesia, Sri lanka, Ghana, Uae, Iran, Korea, Japan, Turkey, Kuwait, Saudi arabia, Australia, Thailand, Burma, Yemen, UK, Hungary, British, France, Russian, Gemany, England, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Nigera, Botswana, SA, Nigeria, Uganda, Gabon, Zambia, Ethiopia , Mauritania, USA, Canada, Peru, etc more than 100 countries.\nIf you need the answers of the questions, you can send messages to us or by the online services: http://pakistancrushers.com/contact.php\n\npenghubung mesin dengan generator \n paijo2007-2-13?\u00b7 mei 6, 2013 pada 2:05 pm assalamu alaikum dan salam kenal mas paijo... saya punya permasalahan dengan plt micro hydro, tipe turbin yang ...\ntata busana, smk, mak, kelas 10, ernawati izwerni weni2009-4-18?\u00b7 ernawati \n izwerni \n weni n. untuk sekolah menengah kejuruan tat... ... hakikat ipa smp 1845 views like liked kegunaan bahan kimia smp ...\nardra.biz \n moralitas, mentalitas, intelektualitasberanda ardra.biz produk produk spa aroma khas bali ratih, produk herbal nirmala massage oil bali ratih body mist bali ratih hand body lotion bali ratih body butter\nkhazanah keilmuan mesin, umum dan islamapakah anda ingin tahu bagaimana anda dapat belajar di teknik lebih mudah daripada yang anda pernah pikirkan? apakah anda ingin menjadi summa cum laude di ...\nsukhoi su-27 - wikipedia bahasa indonesia, ensiklopedia bebassukhoi su-27 (kode nato: flanker) adalah pesawat tempur yang awalnya diproduksi oleh uni soviet , dan dirancang oleh biro desain sukhoi . pesawat ini direncanakan ...\nkopi (coffea robusta l) \n eri tristiyanto2010-1-22?\u00b7 nama ilmiah coffea robusta lindl, ex de willd. klasifikasi divisi: spermatophyta sub divisi: angiospermae kelas: dicotyledonae bangsa: rubiales ...\nslide 1manajemen operasi program s1 manajemen 2009 bacaan utama: 1. pangestu subagyo, manajemen operasi bpfe, yogyakarta. 2. roberta s russell ...\ndaftar klasifikasikelas merek barang danjasayang disediakan dalam internet, aparat untuk merekam, mengirim, mengolah dan mereproduksi suara, gambar atau data, pembawa data mesin cepat, peralatan ...\npoblem karbu? kilik aja lagi \n kafemotor2007-10-29?\u00b7 by adi_nsrclub tugas utama karburator adalah mencampur bahan bakar (bb) + udara (o2). kira-kira dengan perbandingan range nya bb : o2 adl 1 : ...\npergerakan harga emas dunia hari ini, gold price \n ardra.bizberanda ardra.biz produk produk spa aroma khas bali ratih, produk herbal nirmala massage oil bali ratih body mist bali ratih hand body lotion bali ratih body butt", "title": "desain mesin pengering kopi tipe putar", "publishedDate": "2014-02-20T23:55:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5PuFVZ2X7Y", "description": "********READ MORE********\n\n\n\n\n******INTRO******\nI'm going to be doing a series of \"Townie Makeovers\" starting out with all the sims in Sunset Valley.

Need I say more Beyhive? \nTwo new Queen B tracks have hit the web that will be featured on the new Platinum Edition box set on a disc titled \u201cMore\u201d, as in more new music. Stuff we didn\u2019t hear on that surprise album. The new songs to hit the Internet today are \u201c7/11\u201d and \u201cRing Off.\u201d\nIn hip hop flavored \u201c7/11\u201d B really wants us to put our hands up:\n\nWhile \u201cRing Off\u201d takes a different tone. Remember when B used to stress that if you like it than you shoulda put a ring on it? Well this is just the opposite.\n\nNow before people start speculating if the song is about B and Jay divorce rumors, pipe down. In the song she seems to be referring to her mother, and female empowerment, NOT a personal story. Beyonce sings, \u201cAfter all your tears, after all that pains all clear, Mama, after all them years you can start all over again Mama.\u201d And if that\u2019s not convincing enough for you, the song begins with her singing, \u201cMama I understand your many sleepless nights when you sit and you think about father or how you tried to be the perfect wife.\u201d Seemingly the song is paying homage to her mother and a tribute to her being able to start over. Not about Jay. \nAnd super random, but can I just point out the fact that on the day Beyonce releases a song called \u201c7/11,\u201d photos surface of her being photographed drinking a Slurpee. It\u2019s kinda perfect. Don\u2019t forget the Box set drops November 24.\nWhat do WE think of the new songs? I gotta know!

As far as sublingual tablets are concerned they are normally taken for angina, person has a heart problem he takes it, this sublingual tablet is kept beneath the tongue, it is not supposed to be swallowed and it is not a sort of a food or nourishment, it gets absorbed and the treatment is done, so because of this ruling it does not break the fast. You should not swallow the tablet, it goes subcutaneously, it gets absorbed without going to the throat. \nIf you use nasal drops, as long as the nasal drops does not go into the throat and into the stomach, it's permitted. If you put ear drops, also it's permitted as I mentioned earlier or if you syringe the ear, even that's permitted.\nAs far as investigations are concerned if you do a per-vaginal investigation, whether you insert a finger or you insert an instrument, it's permitted. Or for treatment if you insert a vaginal pessary or you insert a Douche or any instruments it's permitted. If you insert an instrument in the uterus or any device known as IUD, Intra Uterine Device or you insert a Catheter for investigation or a scope, all these are permitted. Even if you insert in the urinary tract, that is the urethra, a Catheter or inject a dye for doing an investigation it does not break the fast.\nSimilarly if you take any injections as I mentioned earlier, subcutaneous or intravenous or intramuscular, as long as it is not a nourishment for the body, it's not nutrient for the body, it doesn't substitute the food, it's permitted. If its substitute it breaks the fast.\nFurthermore if you take out a little bit of blood from the body for testing that doesn't break the fast also. And if you apply certain creams, may be cream or lotion or medical ointment on the skin and it gets absorbed by the skin, this too does not break the fast and it is perfectly permitted. \nAnd if you take other treatments, like for example, if you do a laparoscopy in which there is a small insertion made on the abdomen and insert a scope, whether for investigation or whether for treatment or for a surgery it's permitted. If you do a Gastroscopy, insert a scope into the stomach, as long as you do not put in some fluids or some nourishment, it's permitted for investigation. If you put an instrument in the spinal cord to examine the spinal cord or to see how the brain's functioning all these are permitted. If you do Anima even that's permitted and you can go on and on as long as the basic rule is that it should not enter the body through the mouth or through the nose or it's should not be a nourishment, otherwise if it enters any other part of the body, any instrument, whether it be the urethra, whether it be the uterus, whether it be the vagina all these things as a basic rule it does not break the fast because it is not giving food to the body and this is not the normal passage for food for the body.

But this should not be! Aside from the fact that it is a native shrub and the State Flower of Oregon, the long-leaf Oregon grape is a great addition to any landscape from residential yards and manicured gardens to city parks.\nThis evergreen shrub prefers the environment of the woods and woodland edges in the Pacific Northwest but it can also be cultivated with little special care in order for it to thrive. Plant it in slightly acidic soil with rich organic matter but little to no sogginess; it will thrive in dry shade when its roots have been established. It is also important to provide shelter for the plant especially during severe weather.\nTo collect the seeds, allow the unblemished fruit to ripen on the branch. Gather, clean and then dry the seeds before sowing.\nKeep in mind that the long-leaf Oregon grape spreads very slowly but it is also noteworthy for its ability to provide three seasons of interest to the gardener. Call it a late bloomer, if you will, but when it blooms, its showy flowers and fruits coupled with its fascinating leaves really catches the eye.\nIn the spring, the new growth emerges with the plant exploding in tints of light greens and coppery-reds. As the season progresses, the sprays of small, bright and beautiful fragrant yellow flowers open up to attract bees and hummingbirds to drink from its nectar while they go near to admire its beauty. In the winter, the foliage acquires a bright red to burgundy coloration that make the long-leaf Oregon leaf stand out from the gray landscape.\nAnd don't forget the clusters of dusky blue berries. These are edible as jelly especially when combined with apple concentrate.", "title": "Mahonia nervosa - Oregon Grape Is a Great Natural Landscape Addition | Scholls Valley Native Nursery", "publishedDate": "2012-12-05T16:59:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5VxoWmC2sQ", "description": "", "title": "Teaching the Tact - Expressive Label", "publishedDate": "2011-05-21T01:55:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5W_VL5WbrM", "description": "\"HUman Development, A Life Form Program In The Evolution of Consciousness\":\nERIDU, REBUILT\nInAuguRAtion of the Afterlife Spirit Guide in the Default Setting, a Mystery School\nBiLocation: Queen Street, Auckland Central, 31.01.10/2012-2\n\nOMni OMni OMni\n11:11, 12:12, 12:21, 11:44", "title": "HI:HA:HU \"ERIDU, REBUILT\" COSMIC DANCE", "publishedDate": "2010-01-31T10:49:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5WlcWSonuk", "description": "The Hearing - George As A Boy\n\nSong from the album Dorian (GAEA Records, 2013)\n\nDirector: Teemu Niukkanen\nCamera: Matti Eerik\u00e4inen\nActors: Jerry Ylk\u00e4nen and Ilkka Isokoski\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Ringasofi\nhttp://www.gaea.fi/booking/artist/the-hearing/\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/fi/album/dorian/id715613576", "title": "The Hearing - George As A Boy", "publishedDate": "2013-12-09T08:08:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5WwyXoDIAg", "description": "\u6f14\u594f\uff1a\u3057\u305a\u304f\uff08\u5275\u4f5c\u30ab\u30ea\u30f3\u30d0\u5de5\u623f\uff09\nplayer: Shizuku\n\u7de8\u66f2\uff1a\u6a2a\u7530 \u5927\u53f8\narranger: Daiji Yokota\n2010\u5e7410\u670826\u65e5\u53ce\u9332\n\u5275\u4f5c\u30ab\u30ea\u30f3\u30d0\u5de5\u623f\nhttp://kalimba.jp", "title": "chromatic kalimba : Beauty and the Beast (Disney cinema)\u30ab\u30ea\u30f3\u30d0", "publishedDate": "2010-11-03T09:46:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5X5Pn9koR4", "description": "Linkin Park live at HP Pavilion, San Jose(02/22/11).\n\nSET LIST:\n    * The Requiem\n    * Faint\n    * Lying From You\n    * Given Up\n    * What I've Done\n    * No More Sorrow\n    * From The Inside\n    * Jomada del Muerto\n    * Waiting For The End\n    * Blackout\n    * Numb\n    * The Radiance\n    * Iridescent\n    * The Messenger\n    * Fallout\n    * The Catalyst\n    * Shadow Of The Day\n    * In The End\n    * Bleed It Out\n\n    * Empty Spaces\n    * When They Come For Me\n    * Papercut\n    * Crawling\n    * New Divide\n    * One Step Closer", "title": "#LPLIVE-02-22-2011 Linkin Park \"Lying From You\" Live in San Jose", "publishedDate": "2011-02-23T09:54:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5X6BY4F3Go", "description": "Global Day of Action Against Siege and Occupation, Rally and March, Toronto, Sunday, June 10, 2007\n\nEnd the occupation of Palestine: rally and march\n\nRally and march\nSunday, June 10\n1:00pm\nUnited States Consulate\n360 University Avenue\n(TTC: St. Patrick or Osgoode)\n\nBring drums, instruments, banners, street art, friends, family and voices!\n\nFor forty years, Israel has constructed illegal settlements on stolen Palestinian land. For forty years, Israel has killed thousands of Palestinians, demolished 12,000 Palestinian homes, arrested 650,000 Palestinians, and uprooted more than a million Palestinian olive trees.\n\nSince 2002, the Apartheid Wall built on occupied Palestinian territory has effectively encircled the Palestinian population, squeezing Palestinians into truncated Bantustans, cementing Israeli expansionism, and forcing thousands Palestinians off of their land. The Wall divides farmers from their land, students from their schools, workers from their jobs, and people from their communities.\n\nDespite the fact that the International Court of Justice ruled it illegal, the Wall now encircles Palestinian towns and cities in the most massive land-grab in forty years. In its recent war against Lebanon, Israel's unilateralism and militarism have been exposed to the world. Israel continues to establish \"facts on the ground\" to maintain strategic control over the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and to annex land and get rid of the non-Jewish indigenous population.\n\nIn Jerusalem and inside Israel, Palestinians face institutionalized discrimination and are denied equality and their full rights as citizens since 1948. And Israel continues to deny Palestinian refugees, who were forcibly exiled from their homeland in the 1947-48 war, their internationally guaranteed rights, including the right to return to one's homeland and the right to property restitution.\n\nOn March 29, 2006, Canada became the first country in the world to impose a siege on the Palestinian people living in the West Bank and Gaza, which meant total political and economic sanctions on the Palestinian Authority -- the largest employer in these occupied Palestinian territories. The stated reason for the siege was the formation of a democratically elected government in uncontested democratic elections. Canada had been one of the states calling for democratic Palestinian elections, but was displeased with the result: the victory of Hamas.\n\nThe siege is the first time in human history that the \"international community\" has decided to punish a people under occupation, let alone punish them for democratically electing their leadership. The siege has had a devastating effect on the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza including:\n\n- Eliminating the salaries, wages and livelihood of one-third of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza;\n\n- Dragging two-thirds of the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza below the poverty line (they live on less than $2 a day). These working people and their families now live in fear of starvation;\n\n- The closure of Palestinians areas: Palestinians were prevented from getting to work, school or hospital outside of their canton (usually their village, town or city) for 86% of the year.\n\nJoin together on June 10 outside the U.S. consulate in Toronto to demand that Canada lift this siege immediately, and end any and all Canadian support for the Israeli Occupation of Palestine.\n\nFor more information, please contact Palestine House:\nE-mail: info@palestinehouse.com\nPhone: 905-270-3622\nWebsite: http://www.palestinehouse.com", "title": "Global Day of Action Against Siege and Occupation Toronto 04", "publishedDate": "2007-06-12T13:58:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5XJPHeFYA8", "description": "Mexican Style by Mario Ruiz & Omar Cruz\n\nDownload mp3 here: http://tinyurl.com/net7lvt\n\nProduced, Recorded, Mixed & Mastered by Kev Da Khemist\nTrumpets by Byron Son\n\nFollow Us On Instagram:\n@iamMarioRuiz\n@cruzifixion\n@lab_records\n\nTwitter:\n@iamMarioRuiz\n@iamOMARCRUZ\n@KevDaKhemist\n\nwww.losangelesbasedrecords.com\n\nVideo edited by HJ Chong\n\nFootage credit to HBO Sports, GerritStaron.com and GGG Promotions\n\n#GGG #Gennady #Golovkin #OmarCruz #MarioRuiz #KevDaKhemist #LABrecords #MexicanStyle #Boxing", "title": "Mexican Style by Mario Ruiz & Omar Cruz", "publishedDate": "2014-10-10T21:56:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5XO2SrFEkA", "description": "", "title": "VW Polo-Replacing the front shock absorber", "publishedDate": "2014-03-11T19:22:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5Xchg06o4M", "description": "A rare video of dr Chi Chiang Tao (dr Qi Jiang Tao) practising his 47 form taijiquan in a lovely garden.

In this episode I discuss how maxing out a base as much as possible can prove to be beneficial to you because it allows you to extend the time during which you have access to higher loot available numbers for players you want to raid if they are at or below your level. When you attack a player 1 level below you, you only can obtain 90% as many resources as you would otherwise be able to obtain if you were the same level as that player. But here's the big one, when you raid a player 2 levels below you, you can only loot 50% as many gold and elixir resources as you would have been able to if you were still at the same level as the player you are raiding. Crazy right? Obviously that is a HUGE difference. So, if you're a TH8 thinking about upgrading to a TH9, for example, you might want to think twice before taking the plunge, because all those juicy TH7 targets you've been dominating will loose a whole lot of value. Thus, you should definitely be keeping the max out first upgrade strategy in mind at all times! Also, YOU become a more attractive loot target to someone you were previously two levels below and are now only one level below for this same exact reason, so maxing out at least your defenses before upgrading will make you less easy of a target to attack!\n\nFollow me on Twitter, and see me LIVE on Twitch:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/AaroNeoGaming\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/AaroNeo", "title": "Town Hall Level 6 (TH6) Base MAXED OUT Completely Upgrade Strategy for Clash of Clans", "publishedDate": "2014-04-24T03:10:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5bIL_uhO0A", "description": "At Livermore Casino in Livermore CA you can play Texas Hold'Em, Omaha, Baccarat, Blackjack, Three Card Poker, Paigow Poker and Panguingue", "title": "Livermore Casino Cardroom and Restaurant in Livermore CA", "publishedDate": "2012-01-22T16:51:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5bPc71m6eU", "description": "\u7fbd\u5316\u3057\u305f\u3066\u306e\u30e2\u30f3\u30b7\u30ed\u30c1\u30e7\u30a6\u305f\u3093\u306e\u69d8\u5b50\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u5192\u982d\u3067\u306f\u7fc5\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u305a\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u79fb\u52d5\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u3076\u3089\u4e0b\u304c\u308c\u308b\u5834\u6240\u306b\u843d\u3061\u7740\u3044\u3066\u304b\u3089\u306f\u3001\u7fc5\u3092\u3059\u3053\u3049\u3057\u5e83\u3052\u3066\u306f\u307e\u305f\u3074\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3068\u9589\u3058\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u884c\u52d5\u3092\u4f55\u5ea6\u3082\u4f55\u5ea6\u3082\u7e70\u308a\u8fd4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\u7fc5\u306b\u306f\u7fc5\u8108\u304c\u901a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u3066\u3001\u305d\u3053\u306b\u4f53\u6db2\u3092\u6d41\u3057\u3066\u7fc5\u3092\u4f38\u3070\u3059\u652f\u3048\u3068\u3059\u308b\u3063\u3066\u306a\u4e8b\u3082\u3044\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3057\u3001\u4f53\u6db2\u3092\u884c\u304d\u6e21\u3089\u305b\u308b\u904b\u52d5\u306b\u3082\u306a\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3093\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u304b\u306a\u3068\u60f3\u50cf\u3002\n\u4eba\u3067\u3044\u3046\u80cc\u4f38\u3073\u7684\u306a\u611f\u3058\uff1f\uff57\n\n\u3061\u306a\u307f\u306b\u3001\u304a\u6b63\u6708\u306b\u7530\u820e\u306b\u5e30\u3063\u305f\u4e21\u89aa\u304c\u571f\u7523\u306b\u3068\u6301\u3061\u5e30\u3063\u305f\u89aa\u621a\u306e\u304a\u3044\u3061\u3083\u3093\u304c\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30ad\u30e3\u30d9\u30c4\u306b\u4ed8\u3044\u3066\u305f\u9752\u866b\u305f\u3093\u304c\u3053\u3046\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f(\u00b4\u2200`)", "title": "\u30e2\u30f3\u30b7\u30ed\u30c1\u30e7\u30a6\u305f\u3093\u306e\u7fc5\u4f38\u3070\u3057\u4f53\u64cd", "publishedDate": "2012-02-07T09:01:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5bUI9gs7oU", "description": "INT KOREA EXTRUSION LAMINATING MACHINE (ILC-TEL1300)\nModel: ILC-TEL1300\nKind of web: Plastic Films, Aluminum Foil\nWeb Width: Max 1200mm\nGuide of Roll Width: 1300mm\nMachine Speed: 20~200m/min\nExtruder Motor: DC Motor 75kW x 1750 RPM\nWorking Speed: Max 130~160m/min\nScrew Diameter: 100mm\nExtruder L/D: 32:1\nMain Driving Motor: AC Vector Motor\n\n\nINT KOREA EXTRUSION LAMINATING MACHINE (ILC-EL1300)\nModel: ILC-EL1300\nKind of web: Plastic Films, Aluminum Foil\nWeb Width: Max 1200mm\nGuide of Roll Width: 1300mm\nMax Speed: Max 300m/min\nWorking Speed: Max 280m/min\nScrew Diameter: 100mm\nMain Driving Motor: AC Vector Motor\n\nINT KOREA EXTRUSION LAMINATING MACHINE (ILC-EL130)\nModel: ILC-EL130\nKind of web: Plastic Films, Aluminum Foil\nWeb Width: Max 1200mm\nGuide of Roll Width: 1300mm\nMax Speed: Max 200m/min\nWorking Speed: Max 160m/min\nExtruder Motor: AC Vector Motor 75kW x 1750 RPM\nScrew Diameter: 100mm\nExtruder L/D: 32:1\nMain Driving Motor: AC Vector Motor\n\nINT KOREA, Innovation and Technology Korea is a manufacture of coating machine, slitting & rewinding machine, co extrusion laminating machine, dry laminating machine, gravure printing machine, ex laminating machine, printing machine, converting machinery and parts.

In der indischen Heimat wird aus den Fr\u00fcchten dieser Pflanze das Gew\u00fcrz Kardamom gewonnen. Die Pflanze bildet dicht unter der Erdoberfl\u00e4che kr\u00e4ftige Wurzeln, aus denen sich w\u00e4hrend der gesamten Wachstumszeit neue Triebe herausschieben. Diesen bis zu 70 cm langen Trieben, entwachsen die spitz-ovalen, etwa 60 cm langen und 8 cm breiten, in gegenst\u00e4ndigen Paaren stehenden Bl\u00e4tter an kurzen Stielen. Manchmal bildet die Pflanze auch in Wohnungskultur kleine unscheinbare Bl\u00fcten.\nPflege und Kulturanleitung der Kardamom\nLicht / Standort\n\nKardamom kann gut bei schwachen Lichtverh\u00e4ltnissen kultiviert werden. Die Pflanzen vertragen jedoch auch einen hellen Standort, direkte Sonnenbestrahlung ist aber zu vermeiden.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nDie Pflanzen werden regelm\u00e4\u00dfig gegossen, der Topfballen sollte nach dem Gie\u00dfen gut durchfeuchtet aber nicht nass sein. Zwischen den einzelnen Wassergaben l\u00e4sst man die oberste Schicht des Substrates antrocknen.\n\nW\u00e4hrend der Ruheperiode im Winter schr\u00e4nkt man das Gie\u00dfen stark ein und achtet nur darauf, dass der Erdballen nicht vollst\u00e4ndig vertrocknet.\nTemperatur\n\nKardamom kann problemlos bei normalen Wohnungstemperaturen kultiviert werden. Die Temperaturen sollten jedoch nicht unter 14 \u00b0C fallen.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nKardamom kann im zeitigen Fr\u00fchjahr durch Teilung vermehrt werden. Insbesondere zu dicht wachsende Pflanzen sollten durch Teilung gelichtet werden, da sich die Bl\u00e4tter im Laufe der Zeit gegenseitig behindern.\n\nUm die Pflanzen zu teilen, entnimmt man den Wurzelballen und zerlegt ihn vorsichtig in mehrere Teilst\u00fccke. Die Teilst\u00fccke sollten dabei m\u00f6glichst viel von dem Wurzelstock und den Faserwurzeln behalten. Die neu eingesetzten Teilst\u00fccke des Kardamom k\u00f6nnen sofort wie ausgewachsene Exemplare weiterkultiviert werden.\nErde / Substrat\n\nZur Kultivierung des Kardamom verwendet man Erde auf Kompostbasis. \nUmtopfen\n\nDer Kardamom kann vom Fr\u00fchling bis zum Herbst umgetopft werden. Sobald die Oberfl\u00e4che des Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00dfes von Trieben bedeckt ist, topft man die Pflanze in gr\u00f6\u00dfere Gef\u00e4\u00dfe um. Wenn man die maximal gew\u00fcnschte Topfgr\u00f6\u00dfe erreicht hat, erneuert oder vermehrt man die Pflanzen durch Teilung.\nD\u00fcngen / N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf\n\nMan d\u00fcngt den Elettaria / Kardamom ca. alle 14 Tage mit einem Fl\u00fcssigd\u00fcnger.\nHinweise zur Pflanze\n\nKardamom kann auch unter schwachen Lichtverh\u00e4ltnissen kultiviert werden und eignet sich deshalb f\u00fcr Standorte, an denen die meisten anderen Pflanzen nicht \u00fcberleben w\u00fcrden.", "title": "Elettaria, Kardamom", "publishedDate": "2014-07-22T16:46:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "B5hxJ23bd78", "description": "I though escaping from the cops was going to be easy.

Bhutan's location in the eastern Himalayas, with its subtropical plains and alpine terrain, gives it more rainfall than its neighbours to the west, a factor greatly facilitating forest growth. The forests contain numerous deciduous and evergreen species, ranging from tropical hardwoods to predominantly oak and pine forests.\n\nBumthang is the most historical valley with signs of the visit of the Great Buddhist saints from India, Guru Rinpoche (Precious Master) in the 8th Century. The landscape is in a shape of a Bumpa 'an oblong shaped religious water vase' as seen from chhoekhor on the western hill of the valley. Therefore Bumthang is derived from BUM meaning WATER VASE and THANG meaning FLAT AREA. Bumthang valley the altitude varies from 2560mtrs to 4000mtrs. Crops mainly grows are Potatoes, Barley, wheat and Buck wheat.\nBumthang Valley is the main inhabited valley in the Bumthang district of Bhutan.\n\nThe main town in the valley is Jakar. Bhutan's only brewery, brewing Red Panda wheat beer, is in Jakar.\n\nBumthang is divided into four regions, namely Chhoekhor, Tang, Chhume and Ura.\n\nsource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

At the same time, pronounce the letter b without using your voice box. The effect should be punchy while you mouth the \"b\" sound and expel air simultaneously. Use only the air in your mouth. \n\nTip\nVary the b sound by mouthing the letters \"bf,\" \"bs\" and \"bsh\" intermittently; combine for an interesting rhythm.\n\nStep 2: Create the hi-hat\nClench your teeth and expel short bursts of air while making the \"t\" sound. This is called hi-hat. Keep your tongue against the roof of your mouth and the back of your teeth, maintaining the pressure inside your mouth. Use your tongue to regulate air flow.\n\nTip\nExperiment with variations like \"ts,\" or by drawing the air for longer periods of time to create a \"tssss\" sound.\n\nStep 3: Be a snare drum\nBuild on the kick drum sound to mimic a snare drum. Expel pressurized air using the same technique, only mouth the letter \"p\" instead of the kick drum\u2019s \"b.\"\n\nTip\nVary the snare drum with \"ps,\" \"psh,\" or \"pf\" sounds. Emphasize the variations by elongating the sounds: for example, \"psssshh\" or \"pssssffff.\"\n\nStep 4: Crash like a cymbal\nUse the word ''chish'' to replicate the crash cymbal. Repeat through clenched teeth, without the vowel sound, for a duller crash. Keep your teeth clenched.\n\nStep 5: Make a reverse cymbal sound\nKeep your tongue pressed against the roof of your mouth where your upper teeth meet your palate. Clench your teeth and inhale quickly to create a reverse cymbal. Close your mouth to stop the sound. \n\nStep 6: Get hip-hop inspiration\nListen to old school hip-hop and try to replicate those beats. \n\nStep 7: Develop your sound\nDevelop your own unique sounds by putting all the elements together.

It is part of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. Neighbouring provinces are Bangkok, to the north and west, and Chachoengsao to the east. Suvarnabhumi Airport (or also called New Bangkok International Airport) is located in the Bang Phli district of Samut Prakan province.\nThe province was created during the Ayutthaya period, with its administrative centre located at Phra Pradaeng. It was the sea port of Siam, and was secured with forts, town moats and town-walls. King Rama II starting the building of the new centre at Samut Prakan in 1819, after his predecessor King Taksin had disbanded the town fortification. Altogether six forts were built on both sides of the Chao Phraya river, and on an island in the river the pagoda Phra Samut Chedi was erected. These were involved in the Paknam incident of 13 July 1893, which ended the Franco-Siamese War with  the French naval blockade of Bangkok. Of the original six forts only two exist today, Phi Sua Samut and Phra Chulachomklao.\nIn Thai the word Samut is from Sanskrit, samudra, meaning ocean or sea, and the word Prakan is from Sanskrit, pr\u0101k\u0101ra, meaning fortress, walls or stronghold.\nThe provincial seal shows the temple Phra Samut Chedi, the most important site of Buddhist worship in the province. Provincial tree is Thespesia populnea. The provincial slogan is Marine Battle Fortresses, Chedi in the Water, Crocodile Farm, Exquisite Ancient City, Phra Pradaeng Songkran Festival, Tasty Dried Snakeskin Gourami, Rap Bua Festival, Industrial Estate.\nSamut Prakan is located at the mouth of the Chao Phraya river to the Gulf of Thailand. Thus the province is also sometimes called Pak Nam  the Thai word for the mouth of a river. The part of the province located on the western side of the river consist mostly of rice and prawn fields as well as mangrove forests, while the east part is the urban centre - including industrial factories. It is part of the Bangkok metropolis, the urbanization on both sides of the provincial boundary is identical. The province has a coastline of about 47.2 kilometres. Bang Pu Nature Reserve, about 12 km east of the town centre, has a large bird population. Especially during the winter the Sakdi pier at Bang Pu is very popular for Thai people feeding the wintering seagulls. The park is run jointly by the Royal Thai Army and the Thai WWF, and was officially established at the 72nd birthday of Queen Sirikit in 2004.", "title": "Samut Prakan Crocodile Farm and Zoo, Samut Prakan Province, Thailand (14)", "publishedDate": "2013-11-04T07:28:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "B6EWqT4mj_4", "description": "Star of Artifice, written & read by the poet Harrison Gross.

Blocking any of these steps reduces inflammation by preventing leukocyte accumulation at the site of inflammation.\n\nNovel biologic therapies for Crohn's disease are available that target key biologic steps in the inflammatory process such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and alpha-4 (alpha4) integrin subunits.\n\nTNF-alpha is a transmembrane protein produced by macrophages and T-cells. It is released from the membrane of activated cells in response to endotoxins, IL-1, and TNF-alpha.\n\nThe matrix metalloproteinase, TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), is responsible for cleaving TNF-alpha from the membrane. TNF-alpha binds to TNF receptors on target cells, such as the endothelium.\n\nThrough endothelial activation, TNF-alpha mediates the upregulation of adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin and VCAM-1, which leads to leukocyte migration and subsequent leukocyte accumulation at the site of inflammation.\n\nAnti-TNF-alpha agents are monoclonal antibodies that help to reduce inflammation by binding to TNF-alpha and preventing receptor contact, therefore blocking the pathway to leukocyte migration.\n\nThe alpha4beta1 and alpha4beta7 surface integrins are selective adhesion molecules that bind to the endothelial cell receptors: VCAM-1 and MAdCAM-1 respectively, facilitating leukocyte adhesion and subsequent migration to areas of inflammation.\n\nAnti-alpha4 integrin agents are monoclonal antibodies that bind to the alpha4 subchain and block leukocyte adhesion, thus reducing leukocyte trafficking.\n\nThese novel agents are advancing the standard of care in Crohn's disease. In select patients these drugs are now being used with the goal of altering the course of disease and bringing about mucosal healing.", "title": "Novel Agents for the Treatment of Crohn's Disease", "publishedDate": "2012-05-31T14:12:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "B6NFOJAdD_M", "description": "http://macmost.com/e-248 The line-in input on your Mac isn't meant for a microphone.
