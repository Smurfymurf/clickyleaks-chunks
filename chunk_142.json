The district was operated by a group of railroad companies that acquired swampland and turned it to a centralized processing area. By the 1890s, the railroad money behind the Union Stockyards was Vanderbilt money.[1] The Union Stockyards operated in the New City community area for 106 years,[2] helping Chicago become known as \"hog butcher for the world\" and the center of the American meatpacking industry for decades.[3]\n\nThe stockyards became the focal point of the rise of some of the earliest international companies. These companies refined novel industrial innovations and influenced financial markets. Both the rise and fall of the district owe their fortunes to the evolution of transportation services and technology in America. The stockyards have become an integral part of the popular culture of Chicago's history.\n\nFrom the Civil War until the 1920s and peaking in 1924, more meat was processed in Chicago than in any other place in the world.[4] Construction began in June 1865 with an opening on Christmas Day in 1865. The Yards closed at midnight on Friday, July 30, 1971, after several decades of decline during the decentralization of the meatpacking industry. The Union Stock Yard Gate was designated a Chicago Landmark on February 24, 1972,[5] and a National Historic Landmark on May 29, 1981.[6][7]", "title": "1934 Chicago Stockyard Fire", "publishedDate": "2014-06-22T18:14:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "7xJdjniNvAA", "description": "Cars roaring under Corvette bridge", "title": "Road America Footage", "publishedDate": "2012-08-20T16:07:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "7xJtp4rcgIU", "description": "Brand new product by Ridalco.

After a number of tragic incidents, including the gang rape of Franny, are seen through the special lenses of black comedy, the family is invited to take over another hotel in Vienna, courtesy of their friend Freud (Wallace Shawn).

Glycosylation is the attachment of a carbohydrate group to a protein, catalyzed by enzymes called glycosyl transferases. It is either N-linked, in which a carbohydrate is attached to the side chain of a specific asparagine, or O-linked, in which it is attached to the hydroxyl oxygen of a serine or threonine, the former being most prominent. While N-linked glycosylation occurs largely in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of mammalian cells, O-linked glycosylation initiates in either the ER or Golgi apparatus.\n\nGlycosylation is important because it can influence the therapeutic efficacy, immunogenicity, solubility, and in-vivo half life of the glycoprotein. A major obstacle in the pharmaceutical application of glycoproteins is the inherent heterogeneity of their glycan structures. Mammalian cell culture systems, especially Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, are the preferred method for the production of therapeutic glycoproteins. Other systems such as E.coli, filamentous fungi, yeast, insects, plants and transgenic animals are also being engineered to produce proteins with optimal glycosylation pattern. Optimizing production methods to obtain a glycoform profile as similar to that in humans is the current goal in glycoengineering research. Some of the bestsellers among therapeutic proteins will soon lose patent protection. Therefore, a market for off-patent biotherapeutics is expected to open up, which is worth billions of dollars. Biosimilars or follow-on biologics of the original glycoprotein drugs has led to the marketing of 'copies' of these drugs, varying in glycosylation patterns, etc., and are a challenge for pharmaceutical companies as well as regulating authorities.\n\nDolcera report focuses on finding the key innovators and the industry ecosystem through relevant patents, clinical trials and university data encompassing the advances in the manufacture of therapeutic glycoproteins. The relevant keywords used in the search were obtained after an extensive study of relevant scientific articles and patents. Additional keywords were further obtained by searching for the MeSH terms of the relevant keywords. The relevant class codes for the search were obtained from the control patents and keyword based searches coupled with manual search of classification index. Dolcera has retrieved over 800 relevant patents related to manufacture of therapeutic glycoproteins, covering over 47 worldwide patenting authorities. The report highlights year-wise patent activity (trend line) along with the key industrial players in the field. Patents were categorized on the basis of patent focus- whether novel or modified cell lines or hosts, transgenic animals, novel enzymes, chemical/cell free methods of synthesis, and novel fermentation methods or culture conditions. The categorized patents were further analyzed to determine the key players under each category. A comprehensible result in the form of Dolcera dashboard has been given.

It is a resident breeder in much of the western and central regions of southern Africa and has been introduced to Ascension and St Helena islands.\n\nIts habitat is karoo and coastal or mountain valley scrub. It builds a compact cup nest in a scrub.\n\nThe Yellow Canary is typically 13 cm in length. The adult male colour ranges from almost uniform yellow in the northwest of its range to streaked, olive backed birds in the southeast. The underparts, rump and tail sides are yellow. The female has grey-brown upperparts, black wings with yellow flight feathers, and a pale supercilium. The underparts are white with brown streaking. The juvenile resembles the female, but has heavier streaking.\n\nThis species is easily distinguished from the Yellow-fronted Canary by its lack of black face markings, and its bill is less heavy than that of other similar African Serinus species..\n\nThe Yellow Canary is a common and gregarious seedeater. Its call is chissick or cheree, and the song is a warbled zee-zeree-chereeo.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Canary\nThe Domestic Canary, often simply known as the canary, (Serinus canaria domestica[1]) is a domesticated form of the wild Canary, a small songbird in the finch family originating from the Macaronesian Islands (Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands).\n\nCanaries were first bred in captivity in the 17th century. They were brought over by Spanish sailors to Europe. This bird became expensive and fashionable to breeding in courts of Spanish and English kings.[2] Monks started breeding them and only sold the males (which sing). This kept the birds in short supply and drove the price up. Eventually Italians obtained hens and were able to breed the birds themselves. This made them very popular and resulted in many breeds arising and the birds being bred all over Europe.\n\nThe same occurred in England. First the birds were only owned by the rich but eventually the local citizens started to breed them and, again, they became very popular. Many breeds arose through selective breeding, and they are still very popular today for their voice..\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_Canary.\n\n    Category\n\n    Pets & Animals\n    Licence", "title": "Canary singing ~ Canary Bird song", "publishedDate": "2013-01-03T11:42:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "7xpSJnzPZis", "description": "More details:http://goo.gl/Pajuu7\nMore About extraction process of chromite, Please Visit:http://goo.gl/Pajuu7\nChromite Mining Process - Cliffs Natural Resources\nChromite Mining Process 1 What is Chromite? ...

Cops are good people,\nbut the job has a way of corrupting people. The Am I Free To Go movement is about not getting into troulbe with cops when\nyou don't need too.\n\nWhy are Border Checkpoints illegal?\n\nWell, they aren't. However, Checkpoints that are 10 miles away from the border, stopping every car and searching for immigrants \nare both illegal and annoying. They cost a lot of money to maintain, and you can get through a lot faster if you refuse to deal \nwith them.\n\nHey, you stole my video, can you remove it?\n\nSure, I find the videos via wordpress blogs, tumblr, twitter, youtube, reddit, and from personal emails.

Dieser sehr dekorative und lange haltbare Zimmerfarn bildet Fiederbl\u00e4tter die eher einer Stechpalme als einem Farn \u00e4hnlich sehen. Aus dem kurzen, aufrecht stehenden Rhizom entwachsen die 10 bis 15 cm langen, mit dunkelbraunen Schuppen besetzten Blattstiele. Die etwa 60 cm langen, ledrigen Wedel des Farnes bilden mehrere Paare spitz-ovaler Fiederbl\u00e4tter, gl\u00e4nzend gr\u00fcn gef\u00e4rbt und \u00e4hnlich eines Haifischzahnes spitz gezahnt. An den Unterseiten dieser Bl\u00e4tter bildet der Farn seine Sporenkapseln aus. Diese sind anfangs gr\u00fcn und nehmen sp\u00e4ter eine hellbraune F\u00e4rbung an.\nPflege der Cyrtomium\nLicht / Standort\n\nMan kultiviert diese Farne an einem hellen, nicht vollsonnigen Standort. Ist der Standort zu schattig, so gedeihen diese Farne nicht richtig.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nEin Cyrtomium wird gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig gegossen, nach der Wassergabe sollte der Erdballen gut durchfeuchtet sein. Zwischen den einzelnen Wassergaben l\u00e4sst man die oberste Erdschicht leicht antrocknen. Falls die Temperatur \u00fcber einen l\u00e4ngeren Zeitraum unter 12 \u00b0C abf\u00e4llt, gie\u00dft man den Farn sparsamer und l\u00e4sst die Erde zwischen den Wassergaben st\u00e4rker antrocknen. Bei normalen Wohnungstemperaturen legt der Cyrtomium keine Winterruhe ein und er wird ganzj\u00e4hrlich gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig weitergegossen.\nTemperatur\n\nDie Farne lassen sich gut bei normalen Wohnungstemperaturen kultivieren. Zur Erh\u00f6hung der Luftfeuchtigkeit sollte man das Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00df in einen mit Wasser und Kieseln gef\u00fcllten Untersetzter stellen.. Die untere von den Farnen dieser Gattung noch gut zu vertragende Temperatur liegt bei etwa 10 \u00b0C.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nAm erfolgreichsten vermehrt man diese Farne zu Beginn des Fr\u00fchjahres durch Teilung der Wurzelst\u00f6cke. Jedes Teilst\u00fcck sollte mindestens 4 bis 5 Wedel besitzen. Nach der Teilung kann man die einzelnen Teilst\u00fccke direkt in das f\u00fcr diese Farne empfohlene Erdgemisch pflanzen.\nErde / Substrat\n\nF\u00fcr die Kultivierung eines Cyrtomium verwendet man am besten eine Mischung aus Komposterde und grobem Torf.\nUmtopfen\n\nWenn die Wurzeln des Farnes das alte Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00df vollst\u00e4ndig ausgef\u00fcllt haben, setzt man die Pflanzen in gr\u00f6\u00dfere Gef\u00e4\u00dfe oder teilt sie in mehrere einzelne Exemplare. Der beste Zeitpunkt zum Umtopfen ist das zeitige Fr\u00fchjahr.\nD\u00fcngen / N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf\n\nDie Farne werden alle 4 Wochen mit Fl\u00fcssigd\u00fcnger in schwacher Konzentration ged\u00fcngt.\nPflanzensch\u00e4dlinge & Pflegefehler\n\nFarne neigen zum Befall mit Blatt\u00e4lchen. Hin und wieder sollte man die Pflanzen sorgf\u00e4ltig auf einen Befall mit diesen Nematoden / Fadenw\u00fcrmern kontrollieren.", "title": "Cyrtomium, Zimmerfarn", "publishedDate": "2014-07-21T14:58:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yAYBBGi5RQ", "description": "", "title": "Auf dem Highway ist die H\u00f6lle los - Gott ist unser Co-Pilot...", "publishedDate": "2011-02-02T20:48:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yAcyUmN5_U", "description": "Creggs stupid Cuppa cheese song lol", "title": "Cuppa cheese bitch", "publishedDate": "2012-04-25T17:23:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yAdNbZkKM4", "description": "Pantera \"shedding skin\" and Meshuggah \"future breed machine\" together by trevcocreations. www.myspace.com/trevcocreations", "title": "Pantuggah", "publishedDate": "2010-02-24T05:45:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yBHr1zKfp0", "description": "Animation #1", "title": "Animation # 1", "publishedDate": "2014-01-03T14:02:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yBK7KR1d4g", "description": "Karatachi no hana (Trifoliate Orange Flowers) (arr. for cello and piano)\n\nEmanuel Feuermann\n\n\u2117 2012 Music and Arts Programs of America\n\nReleased on: 2012-07-03\n\nArtist: Fritz kitzinger\nArtist: Emanuel Feuermann\nComposer: Anonymous\nComposer: Kosaku Yamada\n\nAuto-generated by YouTube.", "title": "Karatachi no hana (Trifoliate Orange Flowers) (arr. for cello and piano)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-08T06:11:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yBNX3Ur3Fk", "description": "Ez a kis s\u00e1rk\u00e1nyfa gy\u0171jtem\u00e9nyem :)\n\nMivel m\u00e9g nincs ilyen vide\u00f3, \u00e9s neten is neh\u00e9z hiteles inform\u00e1ci\u00f3t tal\u00e1lni a gondoz\u00e1s\u00e1r\u00f3l, ez\u00e9rt ak\u00e1r ide is lehet \u00edrni b\u00e1rmilyen, tart\u00e1sukkal kapcsolatos hasznos dolgot.", "title": "Dracaena marginata", "publishedDate": "2010-03-28T08:41:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yBg3a8ufdU", "description": "how to make a piece of alabaster", "title": "making a vase of alabaster", "publishedDate": "2008-08-22T19:36:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yBmiWUyTdI", "description": "Alex explains how a semi-auto AK is converted to full-auto.", "title": "AK-47 Automatic Conversion", "publishedDate": "2011-05-03T05:59:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yCC2wdZtbc", "description": "Noise artist Nicholas Bullen at the Ultima Festival, 2009", "title": "Nicholas Bullen", "publishedDate": "2012-03-06T22:08:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yCpKI2y9QU", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/diegomixchato01", "title": "MOMTAGEM - ATROPA DO TORRA, SOCA TCHECA 2014  5 BOCAS [DJ WILLIAM DO JACA ]", "publishedDate": "2014-06-19T19:52:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yCv6MrPi30", "description": "http://usmlefasttrack.com/?p=462  neuropores, 4th week, amniotic cavity, spinal canal, folic acid, alpha fetoprotein, afp, amniotic fluid, meternal serum, acetylcholinesterase, achE, confirmatory, csf, First Aid, for, USMLE, Step 1, wiki, define, wikipedia, usmle fast track, usmle, fast, track, com, fast track,", "title": "Neural Tube Defects", "publishedDate": "2013-03-11T07:00:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yDhql20TSU", "description": "1ST ALBUM [SOLAR]\n\u25b6 NOW available on iTunes: http://bit.ly/MxM2eB\n\u25b6 BIGBANG Products on eBay: http://stores.ebay.com/ygentertainment\n\u25b6 Released at YG-eShop: http://bit.ly/Ljgeh8\n\nFor More Information @\nhttp://www.facebook.com/bigbang\nhttp://twitter.com/ygent_official\nhttp://me2day.net/ygonair\nhttp://ygbigbang.com\nApp Store: http://goo.gl/l9TU6\nGoogle Play: http://goo.gl/UiEn1\n\n\u00a9 YG Entertainment Inc.

Completed when the artist was 27, the work has become an icon of French Romanticism. At 491 cm \u00c3\u2014 716 cm (193.3 in \u00c3\u2014 282.3 in), it is an over-life-size painting that depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck of the French naval frigate M\u00c3\u00a9duse, which ran aground off the coast of today's Mauritania on July 5, 1816. At least 147 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism. The event became an international scandal, in part because its cause was widely attributed to the incompetence of the French captain perceived to be acting under the authority of the recently restored French monarchy. In reality, King Louis XVIII had no say in the captain's appointment, since monarchs were not directly involved in appointments made to vessels like a naval frigate. The appointment of the vicomte de Chaumareys as captain of the M\u00c3\u00a9duse would have been a routine naval appointment, made within the Ministry of the Navy.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC:BA 3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raft_of_the_Medusa\n\nText to Speech powered by TTS-API.COM\n\nImages are Public Domain", "title": "All About - The Raft of the Medusa", "publishedDate": "2014-06-14T08:33:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yDvpReutAI", "description": "http://www.olegcherne.ru", "title": "Shaaban.

Everyone from Josephine, um, like Napoleon painting, to um, the Dutchess of Windsor, and the Duke of Windsor, were both very huge pug people. \n\nI mean Victoria had numerous pugs and loved them so much, and, um, and in fact they were, you know, when she was on her death bed she kind of patted the bed, because she wanted her doggie next to her.\nUm, so, you know, their just very enduring, adorable, little creatures. They can be very strong willed though, so, they don't make a mistake us, because their very small and portable that their pushover's. Ah, so they need to be trained the same way as any other dog does; also, they have very sensitive skin, so you want to use only, you know, chemical free, nice sensitive shampoos on them, because otherwise their going to develop itchiness and you know, skin itch, irritation, that will, you know. \n\nA lot Americans love them, and it's not the royal aspect, because of the movies, Men in Black, um, ah, those movies really sort of made a huge superstar out of \"\"Frank\"\" the talking pug.

This video discusses the pros and cons of each and demonstrates tricks or tips to best secure the flex hose. Safe Dryer Venting.  Protect your home from a dryer fire.  Make your laundry room feel bigger.\n\nNew for 2012 is this pretty impressive DryerFlex product.  See it at www.dryerflex.com\n\nMy lengthy reply to the comment from mid 2012.  \n \nThe connection between the dryer and the wall outlet in the majority of cases, if not 90% of them, requires some sort of expandable and flexible hose, so that a person can make the positive connection to each outlet.  In cases where the dryer can be located far enough away from the wall to allow access to make those two positive connections with hard pipe, then I agree, rigid or hard pipe is the best.  \n\nA point you hinted around was that screws and tape should be used at each joint or connection.  Both the International Building Code and the Uniform Building Code explicitly point out that any sort of penetration (screw) is forbidden.  The most popular and dependable mechanism to tighten the flex hose around the rigid pipe is the worm drive hose clamp.  \n\nThe wire bound foil flex is very easy to work with and has impressive stretch to compressed ratio but since the foil material collapses or folds within the opening, the 4 inch space shrinks to a very abrasive 3 \u00bc\" opening, increasing the airflow friction and therefore a poor choice when considering efficiency.  \n\nThe aluminum flex or semi rigid flex, which is often specified in the dryer manufacturers' installation manual due to its fire retardant capabilities is much more difficult to work with, exhibits very poor stretch to compression ratio and just meets the testing standards set forth in the International Building Code dealing with its puncture and deforming characteristics.  The value in using this flex is that the inside dimension of 4\" is never compromised and the smooth interior surfaces provide little friction and therefore a smart efficiency choice.  \n\nWhat I have discovered is a brand new and very impressive hybrid flex that combines the ease of use and flexibility of the wire-bound foil flex with the fire resistance and airflow efficiency of semi-rigid aluminum flex.  And this is the only flexible duct on the market that has a zero flame spread and zero smoke development rating and that meets the International Residential & Mechanical Codes M1502 and 504 to be specific which require meeting the UL2158A standard.\n\nLet's revisit the deformation and puncture issues that the code references.  When I applied equal pressure to the three types of flex, I noted how well the DryerFlex recovered from the effort to deform it. The aluminum flex easily deformed and did not rebound.  \n\nFor whatever it is worth, there are hundreds of national and independent duct cleaning firms that have switched 100% to the DryerFlex product.  Yeah, hard to believe, but once you hold this new Dryer-Flex in your own hand you'll see why.  In my honest opinion it is the safest, most efficient and easiest to work with clothes dryer transition duct on the market.  I did my own fire test, and it is installed in my house.

It was created on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, which is celebrated annually as Karnataka Rajyotsava (English: Formation Day). Originally known as the State of Mysore, it was renamed Karnataka in 1973. It is the land of the Kannadigas, Tuluvas, Konkanis and Kodavas. The capital and largest city is Bangalore, also known as Bengaluru, which is at the forefront of the rapid economic and technological development that India is experiencing.\n\nKarnataka is bordered by the Arabian Sea and the Laccadive Sea to the west, Goa to the north west, Maharashtra to the north, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the south east, and Kerala to the south west. The state covers an area of 191,976 square kilometres (74,122 sq mi), or 5.83 per cent of the total geographical area of India. It is the eighth largest Indian state by area. With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the ninth largest state by population, comprising 30 districts. Kannada is the most widely spoken and official language of the state.\n\nThe two main river systems of the state are the Krishna and its tributaries, the Bhima, Ghataprabha, Vedavathi, Malaprabha, and Tungabhadra, in the north, and the Kaveri and its tributaries, the Hemavati, Shimsha, Arkavati, Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini, in the south. Both these rivers flow eastward into the Bay of Bengal.\n\nThough several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that Karnataka is derived from the Kannada words karu and n\u0101du, meaning \"elevated land\". Karu nadu may also be read as karu, meaning \"black\", and nadu, meaning \"region\", as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayalu Seeme region of the state. The British used the word Carnatic, sometimes Karnatak, to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna.\n\nWith an antiquity that dates to the paleolithic, Karnataka has also been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient and medieval India. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions. Writers in the Kannada language have received the most number of Jnanpith awards in India.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Verr\u00fcckt, Kansas City, Kansas.  It's among the tallest in the world, and at nearly 170-feet from bottom to top it's about the height of Niagara Falls. Reaching speeds up to 70 miles per hour, the trip down happens very quickly.  \n\nNumber 9. Mammoth, Santa Claus, Indiana. This monster ride stretches a third of a mile, reportedly making it the world's longest. The boats used to take the journey are round, meaning passengers can whiz down the slide at any angle they'd like, including backwards. \n\nNumber 8. Scorpion's Tail, Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. Located at Noah's Ark, billed as America's largest waterpark, is this gem, known for having the first nearly vertical drop in the country. How steep is it? It can send a person plummeting at 50 feet per second. \n\nNumber 7. Insano, Fortaleza, Brazil.  Previously listed in Guinness World Records as the 'World's Tallest', this 14-story giant still terrifies tourists and locals alike. The descent happens at such high speeds, riders often spend a good amount of time airborne. \n\nNumber 6. Dawwama, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It's fast. Really fast. In fact, it's been billed as the planet's 'largest and fastest hydro-magnetic tornado waterslide'. It also won the 2013 IAAPA award for Best New Water Ride. \n\nNumber 5. Brain Wash, Orlando, Florida. If a 53-foot drop into a 65-foot funnel isn't enough to get your heart racing, perhaps Brain Wash's light, video, and audio show will help raise the excitement level. It's been designed to make riders 'lose their grip on reality'. \n\nNumber 4. King Cobra, Jackson, New Jersey. Built to mimic the experience of sliding down a giant, deadly snake's body and straight into its mouth, this ride certainly offers a unique perspective. \n\nNumber 3. AquaLOOP, Moravske Toplice, Slovenia. Riders of this attraction get the back-to-back delights of being released through a trap door and then whirling through the upside down part of the tube. That last part happens while moving at about 40 miles per hour. \n\nNumber 2. Leap of Faith, Paradise Island, Bahamas. One's Atlantis resort water adventure begins by being spewed from the mouth of a Mayan temple god and includes sliding through a lagoon full of live sharks. To keep things from getting too crazy, the resort has installed a clear tunnel between the people and the aquatic predators that like to eat them.\n\nNumber 1. Summit Plummet, Orlando, Florida. Leave it to Walt Disney World to come up with one of the most exhilarating experiences out there. Before taking off from the landing, riders can't see the path ahead. From an onlookers point of view, it looks like the sliders are coming off the jump and then vanishing into thin air. \n\nWhich one do you want to try first?", "title": "World's 10 Most Amazing Water Slides", "publishedDate": "2014-07-23T12:36:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ybc2jINZK0", "description": "Nigdy bym nie przypuszcza\u0142, \u017ce w cieku wodnym o g\u0142\u0119boko\u015bci 50cm (w porywach do 70cm) zobacz\u0119  p\u0142ywaj\u0105c\u0105 wydr\u0119, a nawet dwie (w tle s\u0142ycha\u0107 g\u0142os przelatuj\u0105cego zimorodka) ;-). \nDokumentacja spotkania, ND7100 + N AF 300 f/4", "title": "Wydra, a nawet dwie / Otter / Lutra lutra", "publishedDate": "2013-09-26T03:11:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yc-t4TKzUo", "description": "Deborah Nicholson-Hoshiyama thought she was in the clear, but the long arm of the law reached out over the Pacific and caught her.\n\nHoshiyama, 45, was a teacher at a middle school in Avondale, Arizona just outside of Phoenix.

Along with the Lesser Roadrunner, it is one of two species in the roadrunner genus Geococcyx. This roadrunner is also known as the chaparral cock, ground cuckoo, and snake killer. \n\nAs seen in the video this bird walks around rapidly, running down prey. It mainly feeds on insects, fruit and seeds with the addition of small reptiles, including snakes, small mammals, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, small birds, their eggs, and carrion, including roadkills.

They belong to several genera within a long-tailed group of the New World Parrot subfamily Arinae. The term \"conure\" is used primarily in bird keeping, though it has appeared in some scientific journals. The American Ornithologists' Union uses the generic term \"parakeet\" for all species termed conure elsewhere, although Joseph Forshaw, a prominent Australian ornithologist, uses the term \"conure\".\n\n      Conures are either large parakeets or small parrots that are found in the western hemisphere. They are analogous in size and way of life to the Old World's Rose-ringed Parakeets or the Australian parakeets. All living conure species are found in Central and South America; the extinct Conuropsis carolinensis or Carolina Parakeet was an exception. Conures are often called the clowns of the parrot world due to their constant attention seeking behavior including hanging upside-down and swaying back and forth or \"dancing.\"\n\n      Despite being large for parakeets, conures are lightly built with long tails and small (but strong) beaks. Conure beaks always have a small cere and are usually horn-colored or black. Most conure species live in flocks of 20 or more birds. Conures often eat grain, which causes them to be treated as agricultural pests in some places.\n\n      Conures are as diverse a group as African Parrots, so trying to characterize them all is difficult and inaccurate. The category conure is loosely-defined because they do not currently constitute a natural, scientific grouping. The term conure is now used mostly in aviculture. Scientists tend to refer to these birds as \"parrots\" or \"parakeets.\"", "title": "Jandaya conure", "publishedDate": "2011-03-24T11:11:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yv2cKjcHA0", "description": "preparacion para reconstruccion", "title": "radiador mesabi", "publishedDate": "2008-05-26T01:02:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "7yvG5vKVgwk", "description": "A video introduction to the Oceanic Veo 100 dive computer created with the eDiving Scuba Diving Simulator.

Malgr\u00e9 l'isolement et les 40\u00b0 sous z\u00e9ro, quelques communaut\u00e9s s'accrochent sur les berges de l'immense estuaire de l'Ob.\nC'est l'hiver polaire si long, puis la d\u00e9b\u00e2cle et, presque brutalement, le printemps sib\u00e9rien.\nLes Nenets sont des nomades, traditionnellement \u00e9leveurs de rennes. Certains clans se sont convertis \u00e0 la p\u00eache.\nCes nomades Nenets p\u00eachent, pour le compte des Russes, les plus nobles esp\u00e8ces de l'Arctique : Saumon, Esturgeon, Muksum.\n\nLes quelques Russes - les \" polarniks \" - qui organisent ce commerce restent au village. Les Nenets, eux, vivent au plus pr\u00e8s de la nature, dans des conditions extr\u00eames : p\u00eache sous la banquise l'hiver, et dans les lourdes barques traditionnelle en bois de sapin au printemps ; les femmes rament tandis que les hommes remontent les filets d\u00e9rivants. Ils p\u00eachent en famille, dix-huit heures par jour et logent sous le shoum, la tente tribale en peau de renne. Hivernage, d\u00e9gel, crues, ils d\u00e9placent leur campement au gr\u00e9 de la nature et des zones de p\u00eache.\n\nPascal Sutra Fourcade, r\u00e9alisateur et Franck Desplanques, co-auteur ont partag\u00e9 plusieurs mois durant la vie d'un clan Nenets. Rassembl\u00e9e autour de Niathma, le patriarche, le chef du clan, la famille nenets qui les a accueillis est un cas tr\u00e8s repr\u00e9sentatif des minorit\u00e9s autochtones \u00e9parpill\u00e9es sur l'ensemble du territoire de Sib\u00e9rie, une famille \u00e9largie avec des cousin\u00e9es nombreuses.\n\nAu printemps la toundra redevient une immensit\u00e9 verte et les eaux libres envahissent toute la r\u00e9gion, pour ne plus former qu'un immense mar\u00e9cage. Le clan se d\u00e9place alors pour s'installer le long des berges de l'estuaire, o\u00f9 les poissons qui n'\u00e9chappent pas \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle de la migration polaire viennent frayer, remontant par bancs entiers en direction de la mer de Kara. En cette saison, les jours n'ont pas de fin et les p\u00eacheurs se relaient 24 heures sur 24, pour profiter de l'abondance du poisson. La vie se partage alors entre les barques et le campement. Parfois Niathma re\u00e7oit la visite d'Alexe\u00efe ALEXEIEVITCH, le jeune directeur de la p\u00eacherie tout juste arriv\u00e9 sur la c\u00f4te arctique. Celui-ci essaye d'imposer aux nomades des quotas de productions et vient s'assurer que tout le poisson revient bien \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie. Rencontre entre le jeune cadre russe et le vieux chef de clan, p\u00eacheur exp\u00e9riment\u00e9. Derri\u00e8re la courtoisie des \u00e9changes se profile le choc de deux cultures, entre nomades Nenets et colons Russes.\n\nLumi\u00e8res bor\u00e9ales du printemps polaire lorsque le soleil ne se couche jamais. Veill\u00e9es, blottis sous les fourrures \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du shoum quand on nous raconte des histoires de loups qui ne sont pas des contes pour enfants.

The name \"endospore\" is suggestive of a spore or seed-like form (endo means within), but it is not a true spore (i.e. not an offspring). It is a stripped-down, dormant form to which the bacterium can reduce itself. Endospore formation is usually triggered by a lack of nutrients, and usually occurs in Gram-positive bacteria. In endospore formation, the bacterium divides within its cell wall. One side then engulfs the other. Endospores enable bacteria to lie dormant for extended periods, even centuries. Revival of spores millions of years old has been claimed. When the environment becomes more favorable, the endospore can reactivate itself to the vegetative state. Most types of bacteria cannot change to the endospore form. Examples of bacteria that can form endospores include Bacillus and Clostridium.\nThe endospore consists of the bacterium's DNA and part of its cytoplasm, surrounded by a very tough outer coating.\nEndospores can survive without nutrients. They are resistant to ultraviolet radiation, desiccation, high temperature, extreme freezing and chemical disinfectants. According to scientist Dr. Steinn Sigurdsson, \"There are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth - and we know they're very hardened to radiation.\" Common anti-bacterial agents that work by destroying vegetative cell walls do not affect endospores. Endospores are commonly found in soil and water, where they may survive for long periods of time.\nSome classes of bacteria can turn into exospores, also known as microbial cysts, instead of endospores. Exospores and endospores are two kinds of \"hibernating\" or dormant stages seen in some classes of microorganisms.\n\n\n\nWelcome to Global institute of medical sciences.

Plumber's tools and drain cleaning equipment are our specialty. For more information, call us and we'll be glad to hear from you.\n\nOur company was founded in 1975 as Municipal Equipment Exporters, Inc., and later renamed Max-Life Manufacturing Corporation.\n\nBy the late 1970's we acquired Flexible Plumbertool from Rockwell Industries and proceeded to start manufacturing the tools in Southern CA.\n\nOn a tragic evening in 1982, a fire erupted in our building. On the same night our founder was also involved in a car accident totaling his car. Being able to get money from the insurance company for the damages allowing him to use it to purchase a new building closer to home, he saved most of the manufacturing equipment and started working to build the business again. \n\nNeil traveled around the world meeting new customers making Municipal Equipment Exporters, also known as Max-Life Mfg., a multi-million dollar company.\n\nToday we still follow Neil's vision of high quality tools, exceptional customer service and innovation of new products coming from customer feedback.\n\nMax-Life Mfg.

When Nathan's foot was hurting him, I got out the footbath and the massaging action made bubbles overflowing.

He's such a random funny young man with a silly attitude. Having Down Syndrome doesn't stop him from having many interests and a lot of fun. And just for everyones information his user name is from both Down Syndrome and the System of a Down group that he loves so much. We're all about laughs and smiles, so Subscribe or like his fanpage and come along for the ride :)\n\nSee and like his Facebook fanpage here

Only 1-2% of the pancreas is made up of islet cells. In juvenile diabetes autoimmune response of body starts destroying cells of pancreas.\n\nDiabetes cure by islet transplantation (Edmonton Protocol )\n\nIn pancreatic islet transplantation, cells are taken from a donor pancreas and transferred into another person. Once implanted, the new islets begin to make and release insulin. Researchers hope that islet transplantation will help people with type 1 diabetes live without daily injections of insulin.\n\nProcedure of islet Transplantation:\n\nIn this procedure, researchers use specialized enzymes to remove islets from the pancreas of a deceased donor. For an average-size person (70 kg), a typical transplant requires about 1 million islets, equal to two donor organs. Because the islets are extremely fragile, transplantation occurs immediately after they are removed.\n\nThe transplant itself is easy and takes less than an hour to complete. The surgeon uses ultrasound to guide placement of a small plastic tube (catheter) through the upper abdomen and into the liver. The islets are then injected through the catheter into the liver. The patient will receive a local anesthetic. If a patient cannot tolerate local anesthesia, the surgeon may use general anesthesia and do the transplant through a small incision.\n\nIt takes some time for the cells to attach to new blood vessels and begin releasing insulin. The doctor will order many tests to check blood glucose levels after the transplant, and insulin may be needed until control is achieved.\n\nBenefits and Risks of Islet Transplantation\n\nImmunosuppressive or anti-rejection drugs are needed to keep the transplanted islets functioning. Researchers do not fully know what long-term effects these drugs may have. Also, although the early results of the Edmonton Protocol are very encouraging, more research is needed to answer questions about how long the islets will survive and how often the transplantation procedure will be successful.\n\nHowever, transplanting islet cells has several advantages over transplanting a pancreas. First, unlike the pancreas transplant, an islet transplant is a minor surgical procedure, is less expensive, and is probably safer. Second, scientists may learn how to protect these cells from attack by the immune system.\n\nSeveral methods are already under study. If successful, the person with an islet transplant would not need to take immunosuppressant. Surgery would then be safer and more effective for many people with type 1 diabetes.\n\nThere is also continuing research on the transplantation of animal islets. Because the supply of human islets is severely limited, even the most successful method of human islet transplantation could only cure a small fraction of the people with diabetes through existing sources of human islets from donor pancreases. If islets from animal sources (for example, pigs) could be made to work successfully, a cure would be available for everyone.\n\ntreatment for type 2 diabetes\npermanent cure for diabetes\nayurvedic treatment for diabetes\ncan you cure diabetes\nnatural cures diabetes\ntreatment for diabetes type 2\ntreatment for type 1 diabetes\ndiabetes high blood sugar\ndiabetes symptoms\ncure to diabetes\nnew treatments for diabetes\nmetabolic syndrome treatment\ntreatment of type 2 diabetes\ndiabetes\ntreatment of diabetes mellitus\ndiabetes treatment\ndiabetes type 2\nnew treatment for diabetes\nwhat is high blood sugar\ntype 2 diabetes", "title": "Permanent Cure for Diabetes without Taking Insulin - New Research", "publishedDate": "2014-07-15T22:27:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "7zLBQ12BnhU", "description": "Here's a closeup of Holy Fuck's infamous film synchronizer in action, which they use to scratch instead of a turntable.

USS Cachalot (SC-4/SS-170), the lead ship of her class and one of the V-boats, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sperm whale. Her keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched on October 19, 1933 as V-8 (SC-4) sponsored by Miss K. D. Kempff, and commissioned on December 1, 1933 with Lieutenant Commander Merril Comstock in command. Cachalot was the first submarine to have the Torpedo Data Computer, Arma Corporation's Mark 1, installed that determined the gyroscope settings for torpedoes. Later, she saw action in World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nThis film is part of the Periscope Film LLC archive, one of the largest historic military, transportation, and aviation stock footage collections in the USA.

One tempting detour is over-intellectualism, wherein we get preoccupied with ratiocination instead of transformation. At such times, doubts and questions about logical, informational and philosophical technicalities engulf us, leaving us with little desire or energy for self-reformation. This unidimensional intellectuality is often triggered by the modern scientific approach, whichglamorizes expertise in reasoning, while neglecting character as subjective and irrelevant. The scientific approach deems understanding of a subject to be the result of analyzing, reducing and defining.\n\nThis defining approach that is central in the study of matterbecomes peripheral in the study of spirit. No doubt, defining has its place in spiritual life; it helps us to gain basic intellectual conviction and to discern authentic spirituality from shallow- or pseudo-spirituality. However, the spiritual realm essentially lies beyond the reach of the intellect. We can glimpse it partially using intellectual conceptualization, but can grasp it properly only by spiritual purification.\n\nRead More - http://www.gitadaily.com/2012/08/03/spiritual-advancement-comes-not-by-defining-but-by-refining/ - Talks based on Bhagavad Gita", "title": "Spiritual advancement comes not by defining but by refining !

Welche dies sind, werden wir mit Hilfe von sieben Experimenten herausfinden. Da der Raum, in dem die Experimente stattgefunden haben, eine hohe Temperatur und einen geringen Lichteinfall aufwiesen, erwiesen sich die Ergebnisse als unerwartet. Die Quellungskr\u00e4fte sowie die enorme Wasseraufnahme der Bohnensamen konnte dabei verdeutlicht werden. Limitierend, entscheiden und begrenzend wirken sich Wasser und W\u00e4rme f\u00fcr Quellungen aus. Es stellte sich heraus, dass Bohnen nicht g\u00e4nzlich zu den Dunkelkeimern geh\u00f6ren. Das Licht ist dennoch stark gestaltbildend w\u00e4hrend der Entwicklung (Fotomorphosen). Zum Erliegen kommt die Keimung, wenn ein Luftmangel (bzw. Sauerstoffmangel) vorliegt.

We're here at the Monster Factory. Now, we're going to demonstrate a Drop Toehold.\n\nOkay, the first one will be from the standing position. There you have a Drop Toehold. \n\nThis is a little bit fancier version than the basic model, but it's very efficient that way. And, once he has his opponent down, he'll make sure to push back on this, until he has time to reach back, grab it with his hand, and get into the hold that he wants to get into from there.\n\nCollar and Elbow, Headlock. As Mike pushes up through a partial Duck Under, he gets halfway around his opponent's body, scissors the legs, twists it, and that results in the Drop Toehold. And he'll go from there, to the position that he wants, which could be one of many. The Stepover Toehold, such as that. Or, a Scissors. Or, a move to the Headlock.\n\nIt depends. When you're working in a wrestling match, if you're wrestling someone, you want to try to get to the same body part all the time, whether it's an arm, whether it's a head, or whether it's a leg. \n\nSo, that wrestler has a story in mind of what he wants to do to his opponent. So, therefore, he'll keep going back to that same body part. The theory behind that is wear that part down until it's sore, it hurts, and then you can take control of your wrestler.

They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae, are the most widespread species of the genus Bos, and are most commonly classified collectively as Bos primigenius. Cattle are raised as livestock for meat (beef and veal), as dairy animals for milk and other dairy products, and as draft animals (oxen or bullocks) (pulling carts, plows and the like). Other products include leather and dung for manure or fuel. In some regions, such as parts of India, cattle have significant religious meaning. From as few as 80 progenitors domesticated in southeast Turke about 10,500 years ago an estimated 1.3 billion cattle are in the world today. In 2009, cattle became the first livestock animal to have a fully mapped genome. Cattle were originally identified as three separate species: Bos taurus, the European or \"taurine\" cattle (including similar types from Africa and Asia); Bos indicus, the zebu; and the extinct Bos primigenius, the aurochs. The aurochs is ancestral to both zebu and taurine cattle. Recently, these three have increasingly been grouped as one species, with Bos primigenius taurus, Bos primigenius indicus and Bos primigenius primigenius as the subspecies. Zubron, a cross between wisent and cattle Complicating the matter is the ability of cattle to interbreed with other closely related species. cow cows bovine ox bovines milk milks milking milker milkers tits tit breast breasts meat steak ribs beef steaks animal animals funny fun funniest funniers nipple nipples cute cuter bull bulls cutest scary scariest scarier tribe tribes tribal attack attacks assault assaults farm farmers farmer farming farms field fields agriculture meat meats egg eggs bacon moo mooing sound sounds tail tails pig pigs oink oinks oinker pinch pinches pinching hurt hurts hurting food foods treat treat produce market markets organic organics cheese cheeses cottage parmesan cheddar mozzarella ground grounded grind grinding grinded grounding calves Hybrid individuals and even breeds exist, not only between taurine cattle and zebu (such as the sanga cattle, Bos taurus africanus), but also between one or both of these and some other members of the genus Bos -- yaks (the dzo or yattle), banteng, and gaur. Hybrids such as the beefalo breed can even occur between taurine cattle and either species of bison, leading some authors to consider them part of the genus Bos, as well. The hybrid origin of some types may not be obvious -- for example, genetic testing of the Dwarf Lulu breed, the only taurine-type cattle in Nepal, found them to be a mix of taurine cattle, zebu, and yak. However, cattle cannot successfully be hybridized with more distantly related bovines such as water buffalo or African buffalo. The aurochs originally ranged throughout Europe, North Africa, and much of Asia. In historical times, its range became restricted to Europe, and the last known individual died in Masovia, Poland, in about 1627 Breeders have attempted to recreate cattle of similar appearance to aurochs by crossing traditional types of domesticated cattle, creating the Heck cattle breed. Etymology \"Cattle\" did not originate as the term for bovine animals. It was borrowed from Anglo-Norman catel, itself from Latin caput, head, and originally meant movable personal property, especially livestock of any kind, as opposed to real property (the land, which also included wild or small free-roaming animals such as chickens \u2014 they were sold as part of the land). The word is closely related to \"chattel\" (a unit of personal property) and \"capital\" in the economic sense. The term replaced earlier Old English feoh \"cattle, property\", which survives today as fee The word \"cow\" came via Anglo-Saxon c\u016b from Common Indo-European = \"a bovine animal\", compare Persian g\u00e2v, Sanskrit go, Welsh buwch.[citation needed] The plural c\u0233 became ki or kie in Middle English, and an additional plural ending was often added, giving kine, kien, but also kies, kuin and others. This is the origin of the now archaic English plural of \"kine\". The Scots language singular is coo or cou, and the plural is \"kye\". in older English sources such as the King James Version of the Bible, \"cattle\" refers to livestock, as opposed to \"deer\" which refers to wildlife. oxen oxes Cattle can only be used in the plural and not in the singular: it is a plurale tantum. Thus one may refer to \"three cattle\" or \"some cattle\", but not \"one cattle\". No universally used singular form in modern English of \"cattle\" exists, other than the sex- and age-specific terms such as cow, bull, steer and heifer. Historically, \"ox\" was not a sex-specific term for adult cattle, but generally this is now used only for draft cattle, especially adult castrated males", "title": "The Mating of Cow - Bull", "publishedDate": "2014-01-31T17:43:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "7zs46De21IE", "description": "Ferdinand Verbiest, a member of a Jesuit mission in China, built the first steam-powered vehicle around 1672 as a toy for the Chinese Emperor. It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "New Models 2010 Orlando Florida Classic Weekend Tahoe on 30s Gold Challenger on 8s More", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T18:01:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "7zsSFWQAzGQ", "description": "The most shocking and spooky episode of Ghost House the world has ever seen.\nTHANK YOU PATREON SUPPORTERS!\nhttp://patreon.com/filmcow", "title": "Ghost House 5: Into Darkness", "publishedDate": "2014-10-18T19:45:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "7zsTpJW6rTE", "description": "http://tinyurl.com/Penny-Stock-Egghead-Acces-Link - Click here for more info on The Penny Stock Egghead Stock Picks.\n\n\nstock market\nstocks\nPenny stocks\npenny stock egghead\npenny stock egghead review\nthe penny stock egghead\nthe penny stock egghead review\npenny stock egghead forum\nnathan gold penny stock egghead\nthe penny stock egghead complaints\npenny stock egghead affiliate\npenny stock egghead picks\nnate gold the penny stock egghead reviews\npenny stock egghead fake\npenny stock egghead testimonials\npenny stock egghead pump and dump\npenny stock egghead download\npenny stock egghead reviews info index\npenny stock egghead complaints\nnathan gold penny stock egghead reviews\nnate gold penny stock egghead\npenny stock egghead hardware\npenny stock egghead kevin\nreviews of penny stock egghead\npenny stock egghead ventures\nwhat is penny stock egghead", "title": "Penny Stock Egghead Download | Penny Stock Egghead Pump And Dump", "publishedDate": "2012-08-19T05:44:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "7zsUUZbBu5c", "description": "A man is alleged to have invited his 14-year-old daughter\u2019s attacker to dinner and torturing him to death.\n------------------------------------\nNew iO 2 Channel: http://bit.ly/1DX899D\n------------------------------------\nSTORY LINK:http://bit.ly/1xhH7cX\n------------------------------------\n\nMAIL US SOMETHING:\n\nP.O BOX # 14015\n2408 Lakeshore Blvd W. \nEtobicoke, On M8V4A2\n------------------------------------\n\nCONNECT WITH US:\n\nWebsite: http://www.informoverload.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InformOverload\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/informoverload\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InformOverload\niO T-Shirts: http://iostore.spreadshirt.com\n------------------------------------\n\nIN THIS VIDEO:\n\nSandra Matos: https://twitter.com/TenaciousMatos\n------------------------------------\n\nVIDEO EDITED BY:\n\nSasha Wood: http://instagram.com/sasha.a.wood", "title": "Rapist Invited To Dinner By Family Is Tortured & Killed", "publishedDate": "2014-11-07T23:00:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "7zspWLX1wCI", "description": "An excellent way to feel like a god at minecraft! :D\n\nTheDigitalBrits! http://www.youtube.com/user/TheDigitalbrits\n\nMusic: Crafted Movie - Doors Song\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CraftedMovie\n\nWorld File: http://www.mediafire.com/?nlubdnl3qhd...\n\n\nImportant Links:-\n\nDonate (Toward a new computer) - http://goo.gl/CcSmO\n\nFollow Me On Twitter - http://goo.gl/30oiw\n\nSubscribe To Me On Youtube! - http://goo.gl/Trx7C\n\nBusiness Email (Important stuff!)

De naam bamboe is afkomstig uit het Maleis en in vrijwel alle talen bekend (als bambu, bamboo enz.)\n\nDe stengels bestaan uit dichte parallelle vezelbundels; ze zijn van binnen hol en worden op geregelde afstanden onderbroken door knopen waar de bladeren aanhechten.\n\nDe stam van bamboe kan in lengte vari\u00ebren van enige centimeters tot meer dan dertig meter, en in diameter van enkele millimeters tot meer dan 25 centimeter. De grootste bamboe is de reuzenbamboe (Dendrocalamus giganteus) die tot 35 m hoog wordt en tot 30 cm dikke stengels heeft. De plant wordt in uiteenlopende klimaten aangetroffen, van koude berggebieden tot hete, tropische streken. Hij verspreidt zich hoofdzakelijk via zijn wortels, die zich ondergronds ver kunnen verspreiden om hier en daar nieuwe halmen boven de grond te laten komen.\n\nBamboe is \u00e9\u00e9n van de snelst groeiende planten: binnen \u00e9\u00e9n seizoen kan hij tot volle wasdom komen. De snelst groeiende plant ter wereld is een bepaalde bamboesoort waarvan reeds groeisnelheden van een meter per dag zijn waargenomen. Dit is drie keer zo snel als de snelst groeiende boom. Bamboe is de laatste jaren sterk in opkomst als tuinplant. Vooral de groep Fargesia uit de bamboefamilie is in opkomst doordat deze in een pol groeit en dus geen uitlopers heeft zoals vele andere bamboe soorten wel hebben.", "title": "Bamboe", "publishedDate": "2011-08-07T07:35:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ztyZupTIF0", "description": "A charming fable about how the core American values of inventiveness and stick-to-it-iveness are rewarded.\n\nProduced by http://TheFinalEdition.com\nAnimated by http://zinasaunders.com\nWritten & voiced by Tony Hendra", "title": "The Brilliant Bug of Carnegie Hall", "publishedDate": "2013-08-20T01:22:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "7zufjMn8Jf0", "description": "Video ID: 20140605-002\n\nM/S People celebrating \nM/S Man breathing fire\nW/S Man breathing fire in street\nW/S People celebrating\nW/S Two men with Syrian flags celebrating\nW/S Man with portrait of Bashar al-Assad\nW/S People celebrating\nW/S People celebrating\nC/U Man with Syrian flag\nW/S People waving Syrian flags from vehicle\nM/S People celebrating\nW/S People in cars celebrating\nW/S People in cars celebrating\nW/S People in cars celebrating\nW/S People in cars celebrating\nW/S People in cars celebrating\nW/S People in cars celebrating\nW/S People atop vehicles with Syrian flags\nW/S People in cars celebrating\nM/S People in vehicle celebrating\nM/S Two men dancing with Syrian flag\nW/S People in cars celebrating\n\nSCRIPT\n\nCelebrations rang out Wednesday evening in the Syrian capital of Damascus, as it was announced that Bashar al-Assad had been re-elected to a third seven-year term as Syrian president.

Both booms are positioned with the help of teach files which control specific boom movements and these are prepared in advance. When the final boom destinations are reached a member of the Remote Handling team operates the MASCOT. In this movie a handling tool, supplied in-vessel by the octant 1 boom, has already been attached to the divertor tile and then the man in the loop unbolts the tile using MASCOT. The handling tool with the tile attached is then placed onto the carrier subframe. Afterwards, the handling tool is then detached and the octant 1 boom removes the tile from the vessel. Now the tiles are manually transferred into a container for further storage.\n\nThe new extended (octant 1) boom is the result of a technical assessment and was developed especially for this shutdown. The boom can be seen as a mechanical servant which delivers equipment and removes it when it isnt needed any more. With this improvement the shutdown needs up to 30 per cent less time.

Unfortunately, fair-trade products do nothing to help impoverished migrant workers. Is there a better way to help the poorest of the poor? Prof. Colleen Haight has researched fair-trade coffee for over 10 years and has visited several Central American coffee farms. She suggests that while fair trade has done much to increase consumer awareness, it is not the best way to help the poor. Instead, she recommends buying premium coffees. As premium coffee beans fetch higher prices in the market, migrant workers who work on premium coffee farms earn higher pay.

It is known as multicomponent system that always involves enzymes of the plasma membrane and those in the cytoplasm. An example of this transport is found in E. coli cells. The system was discovered by Saul Roseman in 1964.\nThe phosphotransferase system is involved in transporting many sugars into bacteria, including glucose, mannose, fructose and cellobiose. PTS sugars can differ between bacterial groups, mirroring the most suitable carbon sources available in the environment every group evolved. The phosphoryl group on PEP is eventually transferred to the imported sugar via several proteins. The phosphoryl group is transferred to the Enzyme E I (EI), Histidine Protein (HPr, Heat-stable Protein) and Enzyme E II (EII) to a conserved histidine residue, whereas in the Enzyme E II B (EIIB) the phosphoryl group is usually transferred to a cysteine residue and rarely to a histidine.\nIn the process of glucose PTS transport specific of enteric bacteria, PEP transfers its phosphoryl to a histidine residue on EI. EI in turn transfers the phosphate to HPr. From HPr the phosphoryl is transferred to EIIA. EIIA is specific for glucose and it further transfers the phosphoryl group to a juxtamembrane EIIB. Finally, EIIB phosphorylates glucose as it crosses the plasma membrane through the transmembrane Enzyme II C (EIIC), forming glucose-6-phosphate.The benefit of transforming glucose into glucose-6-phosphate is that it will not leak out of the cell, therefore providing a one-way concentration gradient of glucose. The HPr is common to the phosphotransferase systems of the other substrates mentioned earlier, as is the upstream EI.\nProteins downstream of HPr tend to vary between the different sugars. The transfer of a phosphate group to the substrate once it has been imported through the membrane transporter prevents the transporter from recognizing the substrate again, thus maintaining a concentration gradient that favours further import of the substrate through the transporter.\nWith the glucose phosphotransferase system, the phosphorylation status of EIIA can have regulatory functions. For example, at low glucose concentrations phosphorylated EIIA accumulates and this activates membrane-bound adenylate cyclase. Intracellular cyclic AMP levels rise and this then activates CAP (catabolite activator protein), which is involved in the catabolite repression system, also known as glucose effect. When the glucose concentration is high, EIIA is mostly dephosphorylated and this allows it to inhibit adenylate cyclase, glycerol kinase, lactose permease, and maltose permease. Thus, as well as the PEP group translocation system being an efficient way to import substrates into the bacterium, it also links this transport to regulation of other relevant proteins.\nIt is an active transport. After the translocation, the metabolites transported are modified.\n\n\nWelcome to Global institute of medical sciences.

What we're going to do here is we're trying to get your fingers to work independently from each other, right. So, a very simple exercise that we can do sounds like this- one, two ,three, four, four, three, two, one, right. You could do that. Now notice I'm stretching across four frets at the end there and I'm leaving them all down. That's important because you really want the sensation of just one finger moving every time, right. Then you can move up one fret and do the same thing, right. You can just keep moving up the whole guitar neck. Now you're not trying to go fast you're just trying to make everything work together. That doesn't happen with speed, right. That happens with careful planning, right, every time, right. Now, once you've reached a certain spot on the guitar it's up to you. I like the twelfth fret. We can try to go backwards now, right. So, why don't we do the whole thing backwards which is four, three, two, one, one, two, three, four. Same thing, we're going to move down one fret and do the same thing four,three, two, one,one, two, three, four. Nice and even, right. It doesn't matter how slow you do it. And then all the way down, right. Now, another thing you can do here is we can try and alternate pick. Now this is not an easy thing. This would be the second level after you've already mastered that exercise with all down picks. The next thing you might want to try is alternate picking. Remember, that's down, up, down, up, or up, however you want to think about it, but it's alternating the direction, right. And so now you're adding a whole new level of what you're doing here. Right,now that might take a while to put together so don't get frustrated. It took me a long time to be able to do that. And, of course, we can do it backwards. Same concept we're going backwards and alternating picking. And you work your way all the way back down. And it's a great exercise, not only on the first string, but you can do it on the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth. You can do it while watching TV, reading the computer. It's a great exercise to gain finger independence.", "title": "How to Do Finger Exercise #1 | Guitar Lessons", "publishedDate": "2011-01-24T15:03:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "8-BuPmK4OZs", "description": "A collection of photos and videos of Philippine Culture and Tradition", "title": "The Philippine Culture and Tradition.mp4", "publishedDate": "2012-06-12T00:24:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "8-CFyyQ7NfU", "description": "\u25ca Title: 2 Gather Beat\n\u25ca Vocal: Aki\n\u25ca Circle: ZYTOKINE\n\u25ca Album:  I, SCREAM \n\u25ca Release: December 30, 2013\n\n\u25ca Original theme: \u300c\u59cb\u539f\u306e\u30d3\u30fc\u30c8\u3000\uff5e Pristine Beat\u300d\u3010\u6771\u65b9\u8f1d\u91dd\u57ce\u3011 (Raiko Horikawa's Theme) \n\n\u25ca Picture: http://waa.ai/P0l or http://waa.ai/P0p\n\n\u00a9ZYTOKINE\n\n\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for fair use for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

But Tuesday it's being returned to its home on top of the building.\n\nOur Lady of Lourdes statue has been a landmark along the Camden city skyline for 61 years.\n\nThe statue, which stands 30 feet high and weighs 15 tons, needed extensive repairs after being damaged during August's 5.8 magnitude earthquake. The top three layers of the statue were cracked and there was significant chipping, according to hospital officials.\n\nThe Kreilick Conservation Company at the George Young facility in Swedesboro worked on the structural and cosmetic repairs over the past few months. More than $65K in donations from the local community helped restoration efforts.\n\nThe Medical Center has closed down the main entrance to the hospital on Haddon Avenue as a safety precaution on Tuesday, but hospital officials say people can enter through the emergency department entrance on Vesper Boulevard instead.\n\nOur Lady of Lourdes statue is one of the highest points in Camden, and one of the largest religious statues in the country.", "title": "Repaired Statue Returns to Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center", "publishedDate": "2012-04-03T17:57:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "8-L4khO3c7E", "description": "Video valido para mayores de 18 a\u00f1os.

They don't work, according to a recent studythat cited Los Angeles Police Department data.\nThe LAPD tested both Photoblocker, which is sprayed on to a plate, and a convex license plate cover marketed as a red-light-camera buster. Each potential foil was run 160 times through red lights with cameras, both in day and night conditions. The results were analyzed by researchers who published a report in the Institute of Transportation Engineers Journal.\n\nThe verdict? Despite L.A.'s 32 red-light-camera intersections, which dole out $500 tickets at almost McDonald's drive-through-like speed, the study concludes that you'd be wasting your money by relying on these devices to stop a traffic ticket. In fact, the plastic-like plate shield actually increased clarity for the red-light cameras in some conditions, according to the study.\n\n\"The countermeasures had no effect on plate legibility under dark conditions, with the exception of V-2 (license plate shield), which occasionally caused a slight increase in front-plate legibility in half of the images,\" the study's authors state. \"All rear plate images were clearly legible, with no significant difference between the test plate images and the control plate image. A citation could have been issued in all cases.\"\n\nMorning glare, however, did have an effect on the cameras' abilities to capture plate numbers with the plastic-like shield. The golden hour? Eight to 9 a.m.\n\nIn 2007 a Discovery Channel MythBusters show came to similar conclusions. Besides, the devices are illegal in California anyway .\n\n\nhttp://forum.e46fanatics.com/showthread.php?t=706588\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMjDyHbhXk\nhttp://www.audizine.com/forum/showthread.php/271124-Tinted-License-plate-shield\nhttp://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2010/08/red_light_camera_blockers.php\n\nCalifornia  V C Section 5201 Positioning of Plates\n\n(2) The installation of a license plate security cover is not a violation of this subdivision if the device does not obstruct or impair the recognition of the license plate information, including, but not limited to, the issuing state, license plate number, and registration tabs, and the cover is limited to the area directly over the top of the registration tabs.

And how great is Rodgers: He doesn't act the least bit surprised, fully executes the hug and then gets back to the interview without missing a beat. I love it. It's how I imagine Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox. (And leave it to DeSean Jackson to know exactly when the camera was live on Aaron Rodgers. I can't imagine that was an accident.) \n\nRodgers played a role in recruiting Jackson to play college football at Cal, but then left Berkley for the NFL before the star wideout arrived on campus. The two got to know each other anyway and still stay in touch. \"Us Cal guys stick together,\" the Packers quarterback said this week.\n\nAs Yahoo! Sports' NFL writer Mike Silver would no doubt like to point out, Rodgers and Jackson weren't the only Cal Bears to star for playoff teams this weekend.

It is known to eat lizards, frogs, birds, mice, and even bats, catching them in midflight, as well as rodents and spiders. The Permian genus Euphoberia was the largest centipede, growing up to 1 m (39 in) in length.\n\nNumber 9:\nSolifugae are an order of animals in the class Arachnida. They are known variously as camel spiders, wind scorpions, sun spiders or solifuges.At the front end the prosoma bears two chelicerae that in most species are conspicuously large. The chelicerae serve as jaws. Most species of the Solifugae live in deserts and feed opportunistically on ground-dwelling arthropods and other small animals. Some species may grow to a length of 300 mm (12 in) including legs. \n\nNumber 8:\nMale Ant-mimicking jumping spider, Myrmarachne formicaria, Salticidae Size 6 mm\n\nNumber 7:\nSmall orb weaver, about 5 mm body length. Has it's front legs raised in it's \"pissed off\" stance. \n\nNumber 6:\nDolichopodidae, the long-legged flies are generally small flies with large, prominent eyes and a metallic cast to their appearance. The males often have enlarged genitalia which can be useful for species recognition. The adults are predatory on other small animals.\n\nNumber 5:\nCicindela campestris, commonly called the green tiger beetle is a widespread Eurasian species of tiger beetle. Adults are 12-15mm long. \n\nNumber 4:\nThe Oak Processionary (Thaumetopoea processionea) is a moth whose caterpillars are pests in oak forests and pose a health hazard because of their poisonous setae (hairs), which may cause skin irritation and asthma. The moths are widely distributed in central and southern Europe. The wingspan of adult stage moths is between 25 and 35 mm. The moths are posing an increasing threat to humans as their range is being extended by the warming European climate. The backs of older caterpillars are covered with up to 63,000 pointed defensive bristles containing an urticating toxin.  \n\nNumber 3:\nAnnelid worm. Colored scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of an annelid worm, belonging to the subclass Oligochaeta. This subclass encompasses terrestrial earthworms and species that live in freshwater environment.\n\nNumber 2:\npicture of Polychaete, or scale worm, a species that survive the intense pressures more than 1,000 meters below the water's surface, where the sun's rays never penetrate.\nScale worms have mouths which can turn inside out in order to help them catch their prey. The creatures can exists in both the extreme cold of the seabed, as well as super heated water found near the volcanic vents where water can be 375C\n\nNumber 1:\nA colored scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the head of a maggot or the maggot of a bluebottle fly (Protophormia sp.) with tiny teeth-like fangs extending from its mouth. The maggots of this fly are used medicinally to clean wounds. The maggots are sterilised and placed in the wound, where they feed on dead tissue and leave healthy tissue untouched. Their saliva contains anti- bacterial chemicals which maintain sterility in the area. Maggots are used on ulcers and deep wounds away from organs or body cavities, most often being used to treat diabetic ulcers on the feet", "title": "World's most amazing photos (Part 19) - Horror under the Microscope", "publishedDate": "2012-07-27T11:34:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8-ojSTHv_n4", "description": "In this video we show you how to use charts with gowebTrades Algorithmic Trading Robot. \n\nHere we show you some of the basic elements in our charts module.

Species therein include white-tailed deer, such mule deer as black-tailed deer, elk, moose, red deer, reindeer (caribou) fallow deer, roe deer, pud\u00fa and chital. Male deer of all species (except the Chinese water deer) and female reindeer grow and shed new antlers each year, thereby differing from such permanently horned animals as antelope, which are in the same order as deer and may be superficially similar. The musk deer of Asia and water chevrotain (or mouse deer) of tropical African and Asian forests are not usually regarded to be deer and form their own families: Moschidae and Tragulidae, respectively. Deer are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native species, the red deer, confined to the Atlas Mountains in the northwest of the continent. However, fallow deer have been introduced to South Africa. Deer live in a variety of biomes ranging from tundra to the tropical rainforest. While often associated with forests, many deer are ecotone species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space). The majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest, mountain mixed coniferous forest, tropical seasonal/dry forest, and savanna habitats around the world. Clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the understory and allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that fawn fawns deer like to eat. frog kitten kitty kitties kittens cute cuter cat cats feline felines adorable lovely love pet pets animal animals sweet nice catnip purr purrs purring milk pregnant pregnancy pregnancies puss pussy kittycat kittycats kit pussycat tail tails feed feeding milking mice hunt hunting play playing toy toys whisker whiskers cutest hair hairy fur furry catch playing pussycats litter litters outdoors outdoors urine meal meals scat litter box litter boxes things good bad weird strange odd fast calico calicos  Additionally, access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer. However, adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive. Small species of brocket deer and pud\u00fas of Central and South America, and muntjacs of Asia generally occupy dense forests and are less often seen in open spaces, with the possible exception of the Indian Muntjac. There are also several species of deer that are highly specialized, and live almost exclusively in mountains, grasslands, swamps, and \"wet\" savannas, or riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Some deer have a circumpolar distribution in both North America and Eurasia. Examples include the caribou that live in Arctic tundra and taiga (boreal forests) and moose that inhabit taiga and adjacent areas. Huemul deer (taruca and Chilean huemul) of South America's Andes fill an ecological niche of the ibex or wild goat, with the fawns behaving more like goat kids. The highest concentration of large deer species in temperate North America lies in the Canadian Rocky Mountain and Columbia Mountain regions between Alberta and British Columbia where all five North American deer species (white-tailed deer, mule deer, caribou, elk, and moose) can be found. This region has several clusters of national parks including Mount Revelstoke National Park, Glacier National Park (Canada), Yoho National Park, and Kootenay National Park on the British Columbia side, and Banff National Park, Jasper National Park, and Glacier National Park (U.S.) on the Alberta and Montana sides. Mountain slope habitats vary from moist coniferous/mixed forested habitats to dry subalpine/pine forests with alpine meadows higher up. The foothills and river valleys between the mountain ranges provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands. The rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitudes in the subalpine meadows and alpine tundra areas of some of the mountain ranges. Elk and mule deer both migrate between the alpine meadows and lower coniferous forests and tend to be most common in this region. Elk also inhabit river valley bottomlands, which they share with White-tailed deer. The White-tailed deer have recently expanded their range within the foothills and river valley bottoms of the Canadian Rockies owing to conversion of land to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow up the mountain slopes. They also live in the aspen parklands north of Calgary and Edmonton, where they share habitat with the moose. The adjacent Great Plains grassland habitats are left to herds of elk, American bison, and pronghorn antelope", "title": "Young deer bathing kitty cat!

And although it certainly pays to heed the warnings about pearl sellers, the ritual of selecting a pearl is just as important as the pearl itself. And with that said, I will add my own warning to all the other voices out there: beware of pearl sellers, only buy from reputable retailers, and don't forget that you are buying a fairly inexpensive cultured fresh water pearl.\n\nKeeping the above warning in mind, go forth and enjoy your pearl buying experience, and remember that the price of your pearl includes the memories you created that day.\n\nAs you can see in this video, the lovely Eve has selected a very nice oyster that has yielded a very nice pearl...such as it is. And regardless of the actual value of the pearl, it helps to remember that there is no way you're going to get away without buying some sort of setting for it. No one ever makes it away with just their pearl in hand.

Eventually we'll want to derive this concept from basic assumptions about utility and cost functions, but for now I'll just go through the 2-minute version.\n\nLet's start with supply.  A supply curve is a relationship between the price of a certain good, and the amount of that good producers make.  Let's say they're producing umbrellas.  Supply curves typically slope upwards, since a higher price means producers can earn more from each item they sell, so it's worth it for them to produce more of that item.\n\nNow, on to demand.  A demand curve is a relationship between the price of a certain good, and the amount of that good buyers want to buy.  Although there are exceptions, most demand curves slope downwards.  Intuitively, you'll buy more of something if it's cheaper.\n\nIf we graph our supply curve and our demand curve together, we get this cool little X.  The price at which supply and demand cross is the market-clearing price.\n\nIf the price is at the market-clearing level, producers produce exactly as many umbrellas as as buyers want to buy, so every umbrella is sold, and everyone who wants to buy an umbrella can do so.\n\nWhat if the price of umbrellas is higher than the market-clearing price?  Then producers make more umbrellas than buyers are willing to buy at that price, and we have a surplus.  Similarly, if the price of umbrellas is set below the market-clearing price, buyers want to buy lots of umbrellas, but producers aren't so eager to produce that many, so there is a shortage of umbrellas.\n\nIt's important to realize that the words \"surplus\" and \"shortage\" always refer to price-phenomena.  1000 umbrellas could constitute a surplus if the price of an umbrella is $100, or it could constitute a shortage if the price of an umbrella is $1.\n\nWhere would we expect to see prices in our supply and demand model?  The answer depends on many things.  It depends on whether there is one producer or many, on whether there is one buyer or many, on what the laws are, and on how quickly the market can react to a sudden rain storm.", "title": "Supply and Demand", "publishedDate": "2012-07-16T01:00:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "8-zE1Bqb80I", "description": "Sing and dance to Baa Baa Black Sheep with Annabelle here on Kids Action Songs.

When I first heard the song the lyrics immediately made me think about the opening sequence to the great Agnes Varda film \"Cleo from 5 to 7\", one of my favorites. I usually mull over ideas for days or weeks before coming up with anything decent to share with an artist, but this one just came out immediately. I sent a sketch of the idea onto Sharon and Zeke Hutchins, her manager, then I didn't hear back from them for over a week, at which point I thought, well, damn, they must hate the idea, I blew it! But soon Zeke contacted me and asked if Sharon had sent me the album artwork. I said, no, I haven't even heard anything else off the album yet, let alone seen anything from it. Sharon then texted me pretty much the same question, \"Did Zeke send you the album before you wrote this?\" Nope. I didn't understand what the big deal was. Finally they sent me a photograph that's a big component of the album artwork, it's this beautiful aged picture of Agnes Varda standing in front of a bazillion reels of 16mm film. This image of one of my filmmaking heroes has been hanging on Sharon's wall wherever she's lived for years and years to the point where it's all tattered and weather-worn. I like to think that Ms. Varda is standing in front of a bunch of reels from Cleo from 5 to 7, but who knows. It's just one of the strangest coincidences, and it made us all feel like the video had to be made. So now I can safely say the video is inspired by two incredible women: Sharon, for her musical inspiration, and Agnes Varda, whose inspiration on the both of us is quite apparent.\n\nSharon Van Etten\nArtist Page http://www.jagjaguwar.com/artist.php?name=vanettensharon\nWebsite http://sharonvanetten.com/\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/SharonVanEttenMusic\nTwitter https://twitter.com/sharonvanetten\nInstagram http://instagram.com/sharonvanhalen\n\nSharon Van Etten - \"Taking Chances\" from 'Are We There' out May 27th (May 26th in the UK) on Jagjaguwar.", "title": "Sharon Van Etten - \"Taking Chances\" (Official Video)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-03T12:01:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "80-aAUK5dJM", "description": "Full write-up and strategy here: http://www.tankingtor.com/2012/04/swtor-esseles-hard-mode.html\n\nVideo for http://www.tankingTOR.com showing the third boss in the Flashpoint - The Esseles.

In addition to their battle against small farmers, the\u2028newest buzz about the corporation is the speculation that their GM seeds are linked to the die off of bees. Abby Martin of RT brings us more on their seedy practices and what they are up to now.\n\nThe world's largest seed companies, Monsanto and DuPont, have agreed to drop their respective $1-billion lawsuits. Instead, they will now cooperate on certain genetic-modification projects that were previously the subject of heated legal battles.\nMonsanto is ready to shelve its $1-billion claim against DuPont for what they called an infringement of their 'Roundup Ready' soybean patent. DuPont, in turn, promised to stop calling Monsanto a monopoly power that stifles innovation.\n\"We have spent a lot of time and a lot of energy fighting each other,\" Monsanto Vice President Scott Partridge told Bloomberg. \"There came a point after a bunch of confrontations where their [DuPont] interests and our interests aligned.\"\nDuPont Pioneer will now license two of Monsanto's newest modified crop traits for soybeans, for which they plan to pay more than $1.7 billion through 2023.\n\"This technology exchange helps both companies to expand the range of innovative solutions we can offer farmers, and to do so faster than either of us could alone,\" DuPont Pioneer President Paul E. Schickler said. \"The agreements broaden the Pioneer soybean line-up. Importantly, they give us greater flexibility in developing combinations of genetics and traits to help feed an increasingly crowded planet.\"\nThough both companies appear optimistic in their push for new forms of agriculture, fears are being raised in the US over the possible dangers of genetically modified (GM) products. Both Monsanto and DuPont have spent decades working out ways to make crops more productive through genetic experiments.\nCurrently, 70 percent of US foods contain genetically modified ingredients; there is often no way to know which foods do, since there is no requirement to identify GM foods on the packaging.\nGenetically engineered foods are portrayed as safe in both companies' national advertising campaigns. However, critics claim that GM products may cause health disorders, infertility or even cancer. Dozens of countries around the world have banned or restricted GM imports.\nIn the US, however, GM foods have become a part of public policy, with Monsanto and DuPont lobbyists having a strong influence in Congress -- their latest move was the 'Monsanto Protection Act,' adopted this week.\n\nTags\n\nMonsanto,agricultural,product,pesticide,genetically,modified,food,fruit,controversial,conflict,history,chemical,genes,toxic,battle,fight,against,farmer,GM food,seed,die,bee,business,money,profit,legacy,world,poison,monopoly,harm,good,insect,health,ingredient,support,fear,multinational,crop,corn,death,FDA,organic,consumer,safety,news,report,mass,media,2013,engineered,cancer,disorder,banned,import,export,Massreport147", "title": "Monsanto, Giant GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD and Business legacy around the world.", "publishedDate": "2013-03-27T14:45:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "80C6vAEtxhQ", "description": "Established in 1934, the Nahuel Huapi National Park is the oldest national park in Argentina. It surrounds Nahuel Huapi Lake in the foothills of the Patagonian Andes. The largest of the national parks in the region, it has an area of 7,050 km2 (2,720 sq mi), or nearly 2 million acres. Its landscapes represent the north Patagonian Andean Zone consisting of three types, namely, the Altoandino (with perpetual snow above an altitude of 1,600 metres (5,200 ft)), the Andino-Patag\u00f3nico (in the lower reaches of the hills) and the Patagonian steppe. I't also represents small parts of the Valdivian Rainforest. The park and the reserve lie at an altitude of 720-3,574 metres (2,360-11,726 ft), and are designated under IUCN management categories II (National Park) and IV (Management Reserve). The park is completely protected while the reserve is partially protected. The national park is dominated by the high mountain chain of the Andes, many lakes, rapid rivers, waterfalls, snow-clad peaks, glaciers and extensive forests. It is bordered by Chile on its western side. The park covers approximately 7,050 square kilometres (2,720 sq mi). It is located in the southwest section of the Neuqu\u00e9n and northwest section of the R\u00edo Negro provinces, bordering with Chile. The park has two zones: the park and the natural reserve with development concentrated in the reserve. The largest city and a base for tourism is San Carlos de Bariloche, which is surrounded by the park. San Carlos de Bariloche is the main hub when visiting the lake, and is known as the \"Gateway to Patagonia\", the \"Chocolate Capital\" and the \"Honeymoon Capital\" of Argentina. However, the city and other settlements are zoned outside the limits of the park. A further subzoning into the north, south and southern zones has been implemented with an exclusive recreational area named the Cerro Cathedral. Villa La Angostura is another lakeside resort also within the boundaries of the park. The area is known as the Argentine Lake District, as there are many lakes in the park, including Nahuel Huapi, Mascardi, Guti\u00e9rrez, Traful, Guillelmo, and Perito Moreno Lakes. Cerro Catedral is a 2,388 metres (7,835 ft) high peak within the park and an important ski resort. Cerro Tronador, on the Chilean border, is the highest mountain in the park at 3,491 metres (11,453 ft). Bordering the park to the north is the Lan\u00edn National Park. Geological formations in the park and the reserve are generally tertiary rocks of volcanic origin coupled with andacites and porphyrys. The cliffs of the San Pedro Peninsula depict eroded glacial features and the lakes also show many glacial effects. The park has widely varying climatic conditions with the annual precipitation ranging between 300 and 500 millimetres (12 and 20 in). It rains more towards the Chilean border. Lake Nahuel Huapi is the largest and deepest clear water lake in the lake district of Argentina, with a depth of 425 metres (1,394 ft), . Located at the foot of the Andes Mountains at an altitude of 767 metres (2,516 ft), it measures 544 square kilometres (210 sq mi). The lake was discovered by the Jesuit priest Nicol\u00e1s Mascardi in 1670 who also built a chapel on the Huemul Peninsula of the lake. The lake extends 100 kilometres (62 mi) across the border with Chile, and includes many fjords and the Valdivian temperate rain forest. The southern shore of the lake has many hotels and restaurant catering to the tourist industry. The Quetrihu\u00e9 Peninsula in the north of the lake has been set aside as a separate national park, Los Arrayanes National Park. The lake has many islands. The Forest Research station is located on one of them, Victoria Island, which is a natural reserve approachable by boats. Huemul Island hosted the Huemul Project, the Argentinean secret research project on nuclear fusion in 1949-1952. The park's ecology consists of Patagonian steppe at lower elevations and Valdivian temperate forests at higher elevations. It is notable for its rich wildlife due to its many biotopes, attributed to the varied altitude and precipitation range. Xerophytic Patagonian flora is dominant in the eastern half of the park while the western half is covered profusely with temperate rain forests. The dominant tree species in the park are the lengas, coihue, and the \u00f1ires. Other varieties of trees seen in the park are the Chilean cedar (Austrocedrus chilensis), Winter's bark (Drimys winteri), Myrceugenella apiculata, Lomatia ferruginea, Lomatia hirsuta, Alstroemeria aurantica, Fuchsia megellanica, bamboo Chusquea culcou, Mitraria cocinea and Embothrium coccineum.", "title": "Black Glacier, Nahuel Huapi National Park, R\u00edo Negro and Neuqu\u00e9n provinces, Argentina, South America", "publishedDate": "2014-01-24T01:46:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "80CVBDkeyZE", "description": "This is possibaly the worst indiegogo promotion you'll ever see.

Most people would answer \"Egypt\", but they would be wrong. However, they did inspire the culture that built the most pyramids.\n\nAt its height, the Egyptian empire included many cultures, reaching into the Near East as well as into Africa. Nubia, just to the south of Egypt, was a proud member of the Egyptian empire and adopted many Egyptian customs. Sometimes referred to as Ethiopians in some Bible translations, they became so much a part of the Egyptian empire that they even provided troops to the Egyptian army, according to the Bible. Nubia is also called \"Cush\" in the Bible. Among the Egyptian customs they adopted was burying their kings in pyramids. After mummification, dead royalty were placed in their tombs, which were decorated and filled with supplies thought to be needed in the next life. The base of these pyramids also included a chapel for those who wished to continue to worship the dead king. While none of their pyramids was as large as the great Egyptian pyramids, over the centuries they built 223 pyramids, far more than are found in Egypt! \n\nThe Bible's mention of these people serving in the Egyptian army rings true to history. The Nubians were proud members of the Egyptian empire and continued to enjoy an alliance with Egypt long after the empire ended.\n\nPrayer: \nI thank You, Lord, that Your Word can be trusted in all that it says. Amen. \n\nNotes: Oriental Institute (on line), \"The Kingdom of Kush: Napata.\"", "title": "Dualing Pyramids", "publishedDate": "2010-06-24T09:38:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "80GutAxCF_Q", "description": "Track #6 from EP", "title": "Ophrys - Western Promise", "publishedDate": "2012-04-25T02:52:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "80GyRxh1KiY", "description": ".
