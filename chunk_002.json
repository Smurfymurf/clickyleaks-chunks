They often think \"I am only hurting myself.\" This is not a true belief. In fact, dependency upon chemicals causes one to behave in ways that hurt the people closest to them. It:\n\n1- Dominates the user's thoughts and priorities.\n2- Occupies the user's time, money, and attention.\n3- Deteriorates the user's values and behavior. \n\nAll of these changes directly affect the whole family and has a negative impact on the family. \n\nWhat impact does this behavior have on the family? It creates constant unpredictability. Family members struggle to adapt to the unstable ways of the user: \n\n1- The non-user begins to develop emotional and physical problems.\n\n2- Family member becomes filled with anger, guilt, shame, hurt, fear, and loneliness.\n\n3- They can suffer from rejection, abandonment, and other forms of abuse.\n\nWhat's really at stake for the families of substance abuse or alcoholism? Unfortunately, this is a lose/lose situation for everyone. Healthy family relationships are lost.\n\n1- Lack of trust -- brief periods of sobriety do little to lesser tension since the family has learned not to rely upon the addicts promise.\n\n2- Inability to communicate effectively -- families have learned by trial and error not to talk about problems, and their experience with substance abusers and alcoholics have proven to lead to more fights and arguments.\n\n3- Inappropriate coping skills -- the family has lost the ability to deal with emotions in a healthy way. As addiction progresses, family tension & hopelessness increases. Love becomes confounded by feelings of hatred, eventually finding themselves unable to separate the person from the problem.\n\nCan families take back what was lost?\nCertainly, families can win in these situations, but it will take work and time. As we've talked about, the natural course for families in these situations is for families to revolve around the chemically addicted, giving them all the attention. The chemically addicted revolves their life around the chemical. The focus of both the user and non-user in the family is wrong. The family member has relinquished control of their lives to the user.  In order to stop this cycle, the family members must regain control of their own lives!\n\nhttp://youtu.be/-33JlmR1Ans", "title": "How Substance Abuse and Alcoholism Affects the Family - Reach Recovery", "publishedDate": "2013-12-03T02:18:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "-33pX0PqfvY", "description": "Music by Kevin MacLeod.

Em alguns estados do Brasil, este teste foi necess\u00e1rio para se obter a Carteira Nacional de Habilita\u00e7\u00e3o para ser condutor de ve\u00edculos automotivos. Dentre outras coisas, o PMK visa avaliar aspectos como Depress\u00e3o e Ela\u00e7\u00e3o, T\u00f4nus Vital, Impulsividade, Explosividade, Ansiedade, Emotividade. O teste PMK era muito usado em concursos onde o candidato precisar\u00e1 usar arma de fogo, ele \u00e9 muito usado pela policia federal. Categorias: Exames Exames e testes do Brasil Quociente de intelig\u00eancia (abreviado para QI, de uso comum) \u00e9 uma medida obtida por meio de testes desenvolvidos para avaliar as capacidades cognitivas (intelig\u00eancia) de um sujeito, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o ao seu grupo et\u00e1rio. A medida do QI \u00e9 normalizada para que o seu valor m\u00e9dio seja de 100 e que tenha um determinado desvio-padr\u00e3o, como 15. \u00cdndice 1 Hist\u00f3ria 2 Sa\u00fade e Q.I. 3 Efici\u00eancia 4 5 Refer\u00eancias 6 Liga\u00e7\u00f5es externas Hist\u00f3ria Os testes de intelig\u00eancia surgiram na China, no s\u00e9culo V[carece de fontes], e come\u00e7aram a ser usados cientificamente na Fran\u00e7a, no s\u00e9culo XX. Em 1905, Alfred Binet e o seu colega Theodore Simon criaram a Escala de Binet-Simon, usada para identificar estudantes que pudessem precisar de ajuda extra na sua aprendizagem escolar. Os autores da escala assumiram que os baixos resultados nos testes indicavam uma necessidade para uma maior interven\u00e7\u00e3o dos professores no ensino destes alunos e n\u00e3o necessariamente que estes tivessem inabilidade de aprendizagem (ver coment\u00e1rios sobre isso em \"Observa\u00e7\u00f5es\"). Esta opini\u00e3o ainda \u00e9 defendida por alguns autores modernos que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o de \u00e1reas psicom\u00e9tricas. No seu artigo New Methods for the Diagnosis of the Intellectual Level of Subnormals Binet relata: Esta escala, propriamente falando, n\u00e3o permite a medida da intelig\u00eancia, porque as qualidades intelectuais n\u00e3o s\u00e3o sobrepon\u00edveis e, portanto, n\u00e3o pode ser medido como superf\u00edcies lineares s\u00e3o medidos, mas s\u00e3o, pelo contr\u00e1rio, uma classifica\u00e7\u00e3o, uma hierarquia entre as diversas intelig\u00eancias, e para as necessidades da pr\u00e1tica dessa classifica\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 equivalente a uma medida.[2] Com pr\u00e1tica,treino e, acima de tudo, m\u00e9todo - escreveu Alfred Binet em 1909, podemos aprimorar nossa aten\u00e7\u00e3o, nossa mem\u00f3ria, nosso julgamento, e literalmente nos tornamos mais inteligentes do que jamais fomos. Em 1912, Wilhelm Stern prop\u00f4s o termo \"QI\" (quociente de intelig\u00eancia) para representar o n\u00edvel mental, e introduziu os termos \"idade mental\" e \"idade cronol\u00f3gica\". Stern prop\u00f4s que o QI fosse determinado pela divis\u00e3o da idade mental pela idade cronol\u00f3gica. Assim uma crian\u00e7a com idade cronol\u00f3gica de 10 anos e n\u00edvel mental de 8 anos teria QI 0,8, porque 8 / 10 = 0,8. Em 1916, Lewis Madison Terman prop\u00f4s multiplicar o QI por 100, a fim de eliminar a parte decimal: QI = 100 x IM / IC, em que IM = idade mental e IC = idade cronol\u00f3gica. Com esta f\u00f3rmula, a crian\u00e7a do exemplo acima teria QI 80. A classifica\u00e7\u00e3o proposta por Lewis Terman era a seguinte: QI acima de 140: Genialidade 121 - 140: Intelig\u00eancia muito acima da m\u00e9dia 110 - 120: Intelig\u00eancia acima da m\u00e9dia 90 - 109: Intelig\u00eancia normal (ou m\u00e9dia) 80 - 89: Embotamento 70 - 79: Lim\u00edtrofe 50 - 69: Racioc\u00ednio Lento Origem: Wikip\u00e9dia.\nCURSO DE RACIOC\u00cdNIO L\u00d3GICO TESTE DE QI QUOCIENTE DE INTELIG\u00caNCIA EXAME PSICOT\u00c9CNICO MATEM\u00c1TICO DETRAN admiss\u00e3o em empresas\n http://youtu.be/-3EVgGCO9Kk", "title": "CURSO DE  RACIOC\u00cdNIO L\u00d3GICO TESTE DE QI QUOCIENTE DE INTELIG\u00caNCIA  EXAME PSICOT\u00c9CNICO MATEM\u00c1TICA", "publishedDate": "2014-07-08T08:13:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-3EkJ_lSTUQ", "description": "Sweet Onion Tapenade\nThomas Keller (The French Laundry, Per Se, Bouchon)", "title": "Thomas Keller: Sweet Onion Tapenade", "publishedDate": "2011-02-10T22:11:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-3F-5LvC8c4", "description": "", "title": "MCA Enrollment", "publishedDate": "2014-04-17T23:17:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-3F8AL_w7CY", "description": "", "title": "Federalist", "publishedDate": "2012-07-13T20:02:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-3FFWFTjcu8", "description": "Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\nSubscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\n\nTotal Recall - Official Trailer #1 Colin Farrell Movie (2012) HD\n\nTotal Recall is an action thriller about reality and memory, inspired anew by the famous short story \"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\" by Philip K. Dick. Welcome to Rekall, the company that can turn your dreams into real memories. For a factory worker named Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), even though he's got a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) who he loves, the mind-trip sounds like the perfect vacation from his frustrating life - real memories of life as a super-spy might be just what he needs. But when the procedure goes horribly wrong, Quaid becomes a hunted man.

The  industry has been consolidating for 3-5 decades now, and the trend is  continuing. Look last year, the merger between  Northwest Airlines and Delta Airlines created the world's largest.\n\nOne point I think many are forgetting, include what make up 50 percent  of the travel routes for domestic flights, the regional airlines. When the merger occurs, the contracts within the regional business must be affected. Just as an example, CommutAir (Operating as Continental Connection) has strict ties with Continental Airlines. In the case of a   merger, and with the current airlines alliance being with strictly  Continental, I think it will have strong negative results if a merger occurs.Why would United not say to substitute another regional carrier   in place (As CommutAir only operates 16 aircraft) for these routes due to the vast growth of size. This would therefore put CommutAir in an   extremely unfavorable position, and I can see this leading to possible   bankruptcy for CommutAir. This is one example of a regional airlines, but imagine the others as well.\n\nAnother look back at history: Gulfstream International Airlines Codeshare with  Northwest Airlines expired on June 15, 2009 because of  the merger  between Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines.\n\nDon't think that when you board a Continental Connection flight, that your flying with Continental Airlines.

When She Removes The Foil? This Is Frightening\n\nNicole Allen was hoping to make her daughter smile with a new toy. However, this toy had the opposite effect. It's called an \"Evil Stick,\" and is supposed to play music and invoke happy thoughts. The packaging, covered in brightly colored swirls and a fairy, doesn't indicate what's being hidden. When Nicole peeled back the foil on this wand-like item, she was in for a real surprise. There was no fairy or unicorn. Instead, there was a disturbing image of a young girl hurting herself. Amar Moustafa, the owner of the store where the wand is sold, attempted to defend the toy, claiming that parents ought to be more cautious when picking out items for their children. Though the name \"Evil Stick\" is a bit foreboding, everything else about the toy appeals to young children.\n\nWatch below and find out why Nicole, along with other concerned parents, believes this should not be on shelves anymore. \n\ntoys, toys r us, toys story 3, toys review toys, toys story 4, toy story, toys for children, toys for girls, toys cars, toys r us commercial, toys r us, toys story 3, toys review toys, toys story 4, toys for children, toys for girls, toys cars, toys r us commercial, toys for boys, toys story 1, toys are me, toys are us, toys airplane, toys animals, toys are alive, toys a lover's concerto, toys and tiaras, toys and flavors hellacopters, toys alive, toys are nuts gregor salto dj chuckie, a toys orchestra, a toys orchestra butterfly effect, a toys orchestra midnight revolution, a toys orchestra celentano, a toys orchestra technicolor dream, a toys, a toys orchestra welcome to babylon, a toys orchestra invisible, a toys orchestra always, toys barbie, toys batman, toys baby, toys boys, toys ben 10, toys bus, toys barbie house, toys box, toys barbie dolls, toys bin toy, b toys, b toys youniversity activity cube, b toys symphony, matty b toys, toys cars, toys cars for children, toys cooking, toys commercial, toys come to life, toys collection, toys cars 2, toys cars race, toys cartoon, toys come alive, c toys, cookie swirl c toys, o and c toys, r c toys, toys dinosaurs, toys dolls, toys disney, toys dragon, toys dance, toys disney collector, toys dog, toys dora, toys doctor, toys documentary, d toys, mc d toys, toys eggs, toys egg surprise, toys eastcolors, toys elsa and anna, toys elsa, toys eggs frozen, toys esl, toys r travels, toys excavator, toys english, e toys, wall e toys, wwe toys, toys for children, toys for girls, toys for boys, toys from trash, toys for kids, toys frozen, toys for bob, toys from trash arvind gupta, toys for tots, toys full movie, toys gone wild ytp, toys guns, toys go winding down, toys girls, toys games, toys gone wild toy story, toys godzilla, toys guns war, toys garbage truck, toys geppetto, kamen rider g toys, gundam g toys, toys house, toys hunting, toys helicopter, toys hello kitty, toys hulk, toys hot wheels, toys haul, toys hunter, toys happy workers, toys horror movie, h toys, toys in the attic aerosmith lyrics, toys in the attic live, toys in eggs, toys in the attic trailer, toys in space, toys in the attic omnia, toys iron man 3, toys in the attic full movie, toys ice cream, toys in the attic guitar lesson, toys japan, toys jeep, toys japanese, toys jet, toys jurassic park, toys jcb, toys jaws, toys joan cusack, toys jollibee, toys john jacobson, j toys, toys kids, toys kitchen, toys kitchen set, toys kingdom, toys kingdom indonesia, toys kids videos, toys kids channel, toys kamen rider, toys kiss, toys kinder surprise surprise, toys lovers concerto, toys lego, toys lightning mcqueen, toys lucky penny shop, toys lego ninjago, toys like soldiers eminem, toyz lol, toys lego city, toys lego chima, toys lego marvel superheroes, l toys, buddy l toys, toys movie, toys making, toys minecraft, toys my little pony, toys mcdonalds, toys movie fullspicable me 2 toys, cars 2 toys race, cars 2 toys videos, toys 3, toys 3 full movie,\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Mh3NIZQv4", "title": "It Looks Like A Regular Toy.

Buahnya tersusun di dalam tandan (tersekap di antara pelepah daun) dan bersisik cokelat. Rasa daging buah ada yang kelat, asam, manis, dan kelat asam manis. Namun kualitas buah salak yang dikehendaki konsumen umumnya mempunyai daging buah yang tebal, bijinya kecil, kadar taninnya rendah, manis, kesat (tidak berair), warna kulit buah kecokelatan.\n\nSalak pondoh, salak condet, salak bali, salak sleman, dan salak penjalinan adalah varietas-varietas salak yang telah memenuhi kriteria tersebut dan sudah dikenal umum. Salak pondoh, berasal dari Desa Soka, Kabupaten Sleman. Inilah varietas satu-satunya yang secara resmi telah dilepas oleh Menteri Pertanian sebagai kultivar yang unggul. Ada 3 macam warna kulit salak pondoh, yaitu yang disebut salak pondoh merah (warna kulit cokelat kemerahan), pondoh kuning (warna kulit cokelat kekuningan), dan salak pondoh hitam (warna kulit cokelat kehitaman). Dari ke-3 jenis tersebut pondoh hitam yang warnanya kurang menarik, tetapi paling enak rasanya. Ukuran salak ini kecil, berat kira-kira 30-100 g. Warna daging buah putih kapur, rasanya manis (terutama pondoh hitam), tidak masir, dan bijinya kecil-kecil seperti salak bali. Keistimewaan salak ini terutama dilihat dari sifat buahnya. Buah yang masih muda, rasa daging buahnya sudah manis, gurih (tanpa \"rasa\" kelat), apalagi jika sudah tua.\n\nSalak condet, berasal dari Desa Condet, Jakarta. Ukuran salak ini bervariasi dari kecil, sedang, sampai besar. Warna kulit buah cokelat sampai kehitaman. Daging buahnya sangat tebal, rasanya bervariasi dari manis sampai manis agak kelat, masir, dan kesat. Menurut Sobari (1984) persentase komposisi daging buah salak condet lebih tinggi daripada jenis salak lainnya yaitu sebesar 71,08 diikuti salak sleman 67,44; salak pondoh 67,07; dan terkecil salak bali sebesar 65,36.\n\nSalak bali, berasal dari Sibetan, Bali. Ukuran salak bali kecil sampai sedang. Warnanya cokelat muda cenderung ke arah cerah, dan mempunyai sisik yang lebih halus dari salak- salak lainnya. Daging buahnya tebal, manis rasanya, kering, tidak masir serta mempunyai biji kecil dan tunggal.\n\nDi Kabupaten Sleman, Yogyakarta, selain ditemui salak pondoh ada juga disebut salak gading dan salak kembang arum (berasal dari Desa Kembang Arum). Antara ke-2 jenis salak ini warna dan rasa dagingnya hampir sama yaitu putih kekuningan; manis sampai manis agak kelat dan masir. Perbedaannya terdapat pada warna kulit serta ukuran buahnya.

It is quite natural for some borrowers to find the repayment term short enough to manage the repayable amount. In that case, you can still stick to the payday loans but this time there will be a great relaxation in terms of the repayment duration as this time you will be applying to the 1 year payday loans! the terms and conditions and facilities in these loans will remain almost the same but you will not have to feel bullied or stressed for the short repayment term anymore and can pay it off within a term as long as one year.\n\nHowever, for being capable of borrowing the loan amount offered in the Loans over 12 months, you will also have to prove your capabilities to the lender. That will be proved on meeting these grounds by you:\n\nBeing 18 years old\nHaving the citizenship of UK\nPossessing a bank account with a debit card and \nEarning minimum \u00a31000 per month\n\nApplying www.loansover12months.org.uk/1-year-payday-loans.html will be easy and enjoyable for you as none of the bad factors can affect you. You can easily enjoy an approval in your loan application although you are disturbed by bad factors like County Court Judgments, Arrears, Late payment, Defaults, Bankruptcy, IVA or Skipping of instilments etc. So, you can now be assured that your poor credit rating will not create any issue for you.\n\nHowever, when it is about finding an appropriate help in these loans, it can definitely be an apt option for you.

Or you're just worried that she might? That's a pretty common concern and it's really smart thing to be worried about because scratching is a normal behavior of cats. They need to scratch as part of their regular behavioral suite, or what they do on a regular day. It's part in their time budget. If you don't provide a cat a great place to scratch, they won't definitely find one, and it might be your favorite and expensive couch. \n\nWhat we want to do is figure out what each cat really likes best as far as scratching. Some cats love to scratch horizontally and they'll scratch your carpets, but they'll also scratch horizontal cat scratchers. You can just set them on the floor in those cats' favorite places for scratching. Some cats really like to scratch vertically. The important thing to think about cats that scratch vertically is that you want to make sure that cat tree or the scratching post is high enough so that the cat can really scratch because part of the scratching behavior that is satisfying for cats is being able to put their paws away up and pull down. So, we want to make sure that they have room to really get those claws up. \n\nA lot of times you'll see them doing both paws just like this, and their whole body will go down. So, you want to make sure that that post is tall enough to allow the cat to do that. Different cats like different surfaces for scratching. Some like carpet; some like sisal; some like fabrics; some like plain old solid wood and some prefer leather. \n\nSo, make sure that you check out what your cat likes and then get a scratching post or make a scratching area that meets your pet's favorite needs for scratching. Then, if you find that your cat is targeting your furniture anyway, you want to make your furniture less attractive as a scratching area. There's many ways to do that. One easy way is to put some tinfoil over it so that when they go to scratch it doesn't feel very good and it makes funny noise. The other option is to put double-sided sticky tape there. Of course you want to check your fabric and make sure that's okay for the fabric, but that when the cat goes to put their paw on, again it doesn't feel really comfortable. Now, whenever you're using something on a scratching area that your cat is choosing but you don't want them to use, you want to make sure that you're not just making that cat's preferred area for scratching nasty for the cat but also that you're favorite area for the cat to scratch is awesome for the cat. The way that you do that is catch your cat doing things right. \n\nEvery time the cat walks by that new scratching post, every time the cat looks at this scratching post, any time the cat certainly would put a paw on scratching post or scratch on it, that's going to be a moment for great celebration. So, you might pat your cat in his favorite place. You could put a little catnip in that area, or give some catnip to your cat while he's at the scratching post. Or you could even make treats rain from the sky by just sprinkling them gently around the scratching post area whenever your cat goes over there. But if you do those things and keep your cat's nails turned you should have a lot of success in your cat's normal scratching behavior. Focus on something everybody can live with. And that's how you teach a cat to scratch on appropriate objects.", "title": "How to Keep Cat from Scratching Furniture | Cat Care", "publishedDate": "2013-12-18T04:16:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4EYUdXduQ0", "description": "Advanced AT Phalaris", "title": "Seedmark Advanced AT Phalaris 2012 TVC 09", "publishedDate": "2012-02-13T05:50:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4Ec6jEnx5Q", "description": "", "title": "Ronnie Speeks - Gentle Woman", "publishedDate": "2011-06-24T19:24:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4Eg2onR7Gs", "description": "Quake 2 soundtrack.

Also read how to cure eczema naturally with proven home remedies. Learn how to cure eczema or dermatitis using natural remedies, lifestyle and diet. There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "Home Remedies For Eczema - Finally You Can Cure Your Eczema From Home With Natural Remedies", "publishedDate": "2014-01-28T11:09:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4LdLk_hkAw", "description": "En video med tegninger og lyrics til denne fantastiske sang med Kasper Nyemann - Jeg passer p\u00e5 dig.", "title": "Kasper Nyemann - Jeg passer p\u00e5 dig.", "publishedDate": "2012-10-08T17:21:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4M5e_jTctk", "description": "Kylie Performing 'Come Into My World' Live on her Showgirl Tour. \n\nTaken from Kylie's Showgirl DVD which you can grab now from all good retailers.", "title": "Kylie Minogue - Come Into My World (Showgirl)", "publishedDate": "2008-08-28T13:45:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4MQUVm-Ifo", "description": "Take Me Out Balbriggan For Christmas O'Dwyers GAA Balbriggan Rugby Club\nSunday 29th December 2013\nBracken Court Hotel", "title": "Take Me Out Balbriggan For Christmas - Aaron Whitehouse", "publishedDate": "2013-12-30T20:19:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4MlN-imvck", "description": "\u261e Did you enjoy this video?

On the new signs, the names of the stations are merely transliterated from Ukrainian Cyrillic into English Latin. Frustrating, the lack of translation (eg. Zoloty Vorota translates into Golden Gate) leaves visitors without command of Ukrainian without any hint of the meaning of the names. With no real help from this awkward Ukrainian-English, transparency is supposedly provided by a unique hotel room style 3 digit code number assigned to each station with big ugly numbers on the signs.

Given that the largest known species of snake tops out at around 550 pounds max, it's safe to say no 800-pound snake has ever been found anywhere.\n\nBlurbs for the nonexistent video were created using an actual photo taken in Indonesia in 2012.

They are usually done in combination to induce women and really it just depends.  Sometimes they just break water to induce women and the cervix has to be really favorable, it depends on how many babies you've had.  Sometimes your body will respond to just that but usually Pitocin is needed to continue on with the labor.  If someone is doing a VBAC or a vaginal birth after a C-section, we need to be extra judicious on the use of Pitocin.  A lot of times the doctor will, if we need to induce her at all which we also try to avoid if someone is doing a VBAC, but if we do need to they'll try breaking her water only to see if labor will start up on its own after that.  Honestly it doesn't usually work and so a little bit of Pitocin is needed later.  Pitocin in and of itself is not a bad thing, it has a bad rap.  It's a great hormone, one that's necessary and essential during labor, after delivery, and even during the whole postpartum experience.  During labor your brain releases oxytocin or Pitocin, they're the same thing, and acts on your uterus and tells the uterus to contract.  If someone comes in in spontaneous labor we might need to start them on a little bit of Pitocin if they stall out and if they don't change for a couple of hours.  Because that means their body wasn't making enough and we need to give them just a little bit more to make their contractions more intense and more frequent to get their cervix to dilate so that they can increase their chances of having a vaginal delivery.  It's also necessary after you've had the baby.  We give Pitocin to everyone, whether you had a C-section or a vaginal delivery, whether you had it during labor or not, we give it as much as we can as quickly as we can after delivery to help ensure that the uterus cramps down over all those vessels that were feeding your baby and this helps to prevent bleeding, excessive bleeding.  Your body releases some but we want to make sure this happens because your uterus is a muscle; it can get tired after all those hours of labor and if it chooses to just kind of stop doing its job and relax then you'll bleed too much.  We give you oxytocin to help increase the chances that you'll be fine and you won't bleed too much.  Your uterus shrinks down just to about the level of your bellybutton after you've had the baby and over the next six weeks it continues to cramp down until it's back at its pre-pregnant size and it's behind your pubic bone.  The hormone, again, that helps this happen is oxytocin.  Your brain releases this especially if you're breastfeeding; the hormone of letdown is oxytocin.  You may notice the first week or two after you have a baby you feel extra spurts of bleeding and a little bit of extra cramping when you're nursing and that's because your brain is releasing oxytocin that helps your uterus contract down.  It's really cool; it's nature's way of helping to ensure that things go back to the way they were before you got pregnant.  So oxytocin, or Pitocin, is a great drug and hormone.  We use it very carefully in the hospital; we use it frequently, that's for sure because a lot of people stall out.  There are people who need to be induced, there are people who choose to be induced and that's okay with their doctor based on their circumstances.  It really all depends on your own individual circumstance.  I would talk to your doctor about your concerns and they can let you know more about what they think based on your individual circumstance.  Chances are even if your water was just broken you may end up with a little bit of Pitocin later if you weren't already contracting at all on your own before that.  Good luck with everything and if you have any other questions for me feel free to ask them on our Facebook page and recommend us to your friends and family too.", "title": "What are your experiences with induction by breaking water, and no pitocin unless necessary?", "publishedDate": "2012-11-16T23:41:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4bUXhvLD5M", "description": "http://www.blanktv.com/ Scythia - Exiled Across Canada (Tour Vlog # 9) Like this video?

For a woman, this could be problems with ovulation, blocked fallopian tubes or problems with the uterus. Conditions include PCOS, endometriosis, fibroids and hormonal disorders.\n\nFor a man, this could be low sperm quality and quantity. This could be caused by a varicocele (VAR-ih-koe-seel), which is an enlargement of veins in the scrotum. Other factors can include certain medications, ejaculation issues, structural defects, a previous injury, infection and immune system problems.\n\nIf any tests show abnormalities, your doctor or fertility specialist will recommend options like medication, surgery or lifestyle changes. Which leads us to step 2 ...\n\nStep 2: Preparation\n\nLearn your body's fertility signals, such as tender breasts and ovulation discharge -- when you body increases its estrogen, your cervical mucus will be transparent and stringy, like an egg white. This is your most fertile phase.\n \nChart your fertility and basal body temperature to track your most fertile periods.\n\nPlan each day for moderate exercise, such as walking, swimming or aerobics. This helps increase blood flow to your organs. Statistically, a BMI ratio of between 19 and 25 is the best for pregnancy.\n\nLearn relaxation techniques such as meditation and yoga. Being calm stabilizes your hormones, which in turn helps your ovulation cycle. \n\nStep 3: Vitamins and Diet\n\nEat foods proven to increase fertility. This includes whole milk, eggs whole grain breads, high-fiber fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and fresh water. Look for dark green vegetables and colorful fruit. For meat, buy grass-fed with no hormones, as these will have more wholesome nutrients and vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids. Avoid hormones, which could interfere with your body's own.\n\nAvoid alcohol and smoking, as well as caffeine, all of which has been proven to lover fertility. Unfermented soy mimics estrogen, and refined sugars in sweets and soda can cause spikes in blood sugar levels. Processed foods are just bad for you, period, due to excess sugars, salt, fats and preservatives. \n\nVitamins and minerals which promote fertility include vitamin D, folic acid, selenium, iron and zinc. \n\nStep 4: Fertility Boosters\n\nAcupuncture has been studied and proven to increase your chances of getting pregnant. While the original study, done in 2002 was for IVF patients, subsequent studies show some correlation to increased fertility as well. One theory is that the needles help increase blood flow and triggers endorphins. Whatever the case, it is definitely worth trying this technique. Make sure you find a practitioner who is an expert in fertility-related acupuncture.\n\nAnother fertility booster is an herb called vitex, or chasteberry. It has been used for centuries to help regulate hormones and ovulation, and is being rediscovered by modern medicine as a helpful supplement.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be much better prepared to increase your fertility, get pregnant and deliver a healthy baby. Note that these steps, such as exercise, proper diet, lifestyle and acupuncture are helpful for both the man and the woman. \n\nFor more information, please visit Getpregnantfaq.com, where you can also find my special guide called \"7 Fertility Boosters to Get Pregnant Now\"", "title": "The Path to Fertility - 4 Steps to Help You Become More Fertile", "publishedDate": "2013-07-10T21:27:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4cVHMns_DI", "description": "San Francisco on a Friday night for ya'.", "title": "Dating advice from an inebriate", "publishedDate": "2011-11-12T07:29:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4ciCpXmNkw", "description": "April 10, 2013 Grab Bag Burlesque at the Crack Fox\nVideo \u00a9 Christy Strickland\n\nStarring Pinny Yearned and Bryce Bordello\nChoreography by Pinny Yearned and Bryce Bordello", "title": "Here's To Love - With Pinny Yearned and Bryce Bordello", "publishedDate": "2013-08-11T19:47:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4csr6pLZLg", "description": "Official music video for the single \"Sat in Your Lap\" written and produced by British singer Kate Bush.\n\nThe song was the first single to be released from Kate's fourth album The Dreaming.

I did not make the addon, I just improved it. All credit goes to the original author.\n\nFixes and Features\n- The addon in its original state didn't do any throttling on ability recalculation so it would do this 100+ times per second. I fixed this so it will only recalculate 3 times per second max.\n- The addon in its original state is broken as it doesn't track Hemo properly, so it will never recommend Hemo at all. I fixed it to work with the Hemo glyph, recommending Hemo exactly when the Hemo glyph debuff runs out (this is optimal according to EJ). It will only recommend hemo if you actually have the hemo glyph.\n- The addon in its original state had a bug where rupture sometimes wouldn't be detected. I fixed this.\n- The addon in its original state would recommend Vanish and Shadow Dance even when Find Weakness was still up. I fixed this.\n- The addon in its original state would not take Preparation into account. I fixed this.\n- The addon in its original state would prefer SND over Rupture, I fixed this.\n\nKnown bugs\n- The way it recommends Vanish/Shadow Dance is still a bit dumb, you want to pool up your energy before using it and not have 4+ combopoints.\n- When stealthed out of combat with combopoints on the target, it recommends Rupture while you should be using SND.\n\n\nOther than that I would say the addon is now almost perfect in recommending the rotation for subtelty. Note that the addon can recommend a finisher at 4 combopoints, I set this just so that you know what finisher to use next. You should actually be waiting to receive the 5th combopoint through HAT. You can also adjust this in the options.\n\nDownload\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/41165917/rogue-subtlety.zip", "title": "Rogue Subtlety Addon", "publishedDate": "2011-12-17T17:11:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4n4mD0eRWY", "description": "http://facebook.com/CelineDionGreece LIKE!\nhttp://twitter.com/CelineDionGR FOLLOW!", "title": "Celine Dion - Lullabye (Cystic Fibrosis Benefit 20/1/2013) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-01-26T10:31:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4nGHwfhC1Y", "description": "A two minute observation on the mystery of The Great Sphinx\n\nMusic:\n The Eternal Vow\n - Chen Xie Yang, Shanghai Symphony Orchestra & Yo-Yo Ma", "title": "Great Sphinx of Giza", "publishedDate": "2012-10-19T15:45:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4nHQkmJiF0", "description": "This Video shows to how to get rid of mold in house easily. You might be pulling your hair on how to get rid of mold in house and don't know what to do. \n\nA mold, or mould (see spelling differences), is a fungus that grows in the form of multicellular filaments called hyphae.\n\nMolds are a large and taxonomically diverse number of fungal species where the growth of hyphae results in discoloration and a fuzzy appearance, especially on food.[3] The network of these tubular branching hyphae, called a mycelium, is considered a single organism. The hyphae are generally transparent, so the mycelium appears like very fine, fluffy white threads over the surface. Cross-walls (septa) may delimit connected compartments along the hyphae, each containing one or multiple, genetically identical nuclei. The dusty texture of many molds is caused by profuse numbers of asexual spores (conidia) formed by differentiation at the ends of hyphae. The mode of formation and shape of these spores is traditionally used to classify the mold fungi. Many of these spores are colored, making the fungus much more obvious to the human eye at this stage in its life-cycle. In contrast, fungi that can adopt a single celled growth habit are called yeasts.\n\nMolds are considered to be microbes and do not form a specific taxonomic or phylogenetic grouping, but can be found in the divisions Zygomycota and Ascomycota. In the past, most molds were classified within the Deuteromycota.\n\nMolds cause biodegradation of natural materials, that can be unwanted when it becomes food spoilage or damage to property. They also play important roles in biotechnology and food science in the production of various foods, beverages, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and enzymes.

At five, he learned to play his first song on the accordion, \"Lady of Spain.\" He says, \"I was the original underachiever. I'd shake that thing and smile, but I was sort of a late bloomer.\" Croce attended Upper Darby High School in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. After his graduation in 1960, Croce went to Malvern Preparatory School for one year before deciding to enroll at Villanova University in 1961. During his time as a student at the university, Croce became a member of the Villanova Singers and Villanova Spires, and was a student disc jockey at WKVU.[3][4]\nCroce did not take music seriously other than as a hobby until his time at Villanova, where he formed various bands, performing at fraternity parties, coffee houses, and at universities around Philadelphia, playing \"anything that the people wanted to hear: blues, rock, a cappella, railroad music... anything.\" One of those bands was chosen for a foreign exchange tour of Africa and the Middle East. \"We just ate what the people ate, lived in the woods, and played our songs. Of course they didn't speak English over there... but if you mean what you're singing, people understand.\"\nCroce met his future wife Ingrid Jacobson at this time, during a hootenanny at Philadelphia Convention Hall, where he was judging a contest. When they married, he converted to Judaism", "title": "Jim Croce - Greatest Hits - You Don't Mess Around With Jim", "publishedDate": "2011-09-19T14:33:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4qfMiCESoQ", "description": "John King, Jackie Kucinich, and Manu Raju on a rare interview with Bush and a potential presidential candidacy in 2016.

Park, where he was to launch his hunger strike on Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, sources said, Mr. Hazare got up at around 5.00 a.m. and was involved in a discussion with Mr. Kejriwal and his other associates who are in prison along with him.\n\nMr. Sisodia on Wednesday said, \"We don't have any information on when he will come out.\"\n\nOutside the jail premises, hundreds of people stayed through the night and expressed solidarity with Mr. Hazare and his campaign against corruption.\n\nAt Present, Ramdev and Ravi Shankar have entered the jail premises to meet veteran Gandhian Anna Hazare.\n\n\nRamdev arrived here after submitting memorandum to President Partibha Patil against Anna Hazare's arrest.\n\n\nRavi Shankar also visited Tihar on Tuesday evening but Tihar Jail Authorities didn't allow him to meet Anna, who is adamant to leave the premises without written permission to hold fast at JPN Park.\n\nThroughout Wedneday, the 74-year-old who has become the totem of a people's movement against corruption consulted with his closest aides within prison. Among his visitors were spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and civil rights activist Swami Agnivesh. Outside, among the crowd, popular yoga guru Baba Ramdev, was seen standing atop a car.\n\n\nThe war between the government and Mr Hazare centres on the Lokpal Bill introduced in Parliament last week. The bill is meant to provide an antidote to the seemingly limitless corruption among politicians, bureaucrats and judges. Mr Hazare says the government has betrayed India by drafting a bill that has no intention of seriously and objectively investigating charges of venality. \nEnds", "title": "HUNDREDS GATHER OUTSIDE TIHAR JAIL AS ANNA REFUSES TO LEAVE", "publishedDate": "2013-03-18T07:18:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4sJfvj9n2Q", "description": "Sun TV (vikatan TV) Tamil serial Actress vani bhojan profile\nDeivamagal serial latest episode (today) sathya priya vani bhojan biography\nDeivamagal vani bhojan wiki profile  date of birth lover details\nbiography biodata stills photos images\nVani bhojan married to ....", "title": "Deivamagal Serial Actress Vani Bhojan Biography", "publishedDate": "2014-09-09T14:43:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4sNoLNeE7g", "description": "", "title": "Tilt and Tunble microincision coaxial phacoemulsification", "publishedDate": "2013-05-22T13:05:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-4sQFvT-19w", "description": "Halla Everybodi!

Species in the family include white-tailed deer, mule deer such as black-tailed deer, elk, moose, red deer, reindeer (caribou), fallow deer, roe deer, pud\u00fa and chital. Male deer of all species (except the Chinese water deer) and also female reindeer grow and shed new antlers each year. In this they differ from permanently horned animals such as antelope; these are in the same order as deer and may bear a superficial resemblance. The musk deer of Asia and water chevrotain (or mouse deer) of tropical African and Asian forests are not usually regarded as true deer and form their own families, Moschidae and Tragulidae, respectively.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

MacDonald, Wesley Strick, James R. Webb\nFilm Description: Martin Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear provided the director with a box-office success to follow up the critical success of the previous year's Goodfellas. After serving a lengthy prison sentence for a sexual assault, Max Cady (Robert De Niro) comes calling on the man who served as his public defender, Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte). Max begins a campaign of harassment against the man and his family because Bowden buried a report that would have in all likelihood acquitted Cady of the charges against him. Bowden's shaky ethics continue in his personal life as he is considering beginning an extramarital affair with colleague Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), since he and his wife, Leigh (Jessica Lange) have had a difficult time coming back together since he has admitted to previous indiscretions. Cady infiltrates the family most insidiously by cultivating a relationship with the Bowden's troubled teenage daughte, Danielle (Juliette Lewis), who is all the more susceptible to Cady's advances because of her parents' problems. Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck, the stars of the original film, have cameo appearances in this version of Cape Fear. De Niro and Lewis were both nominated for Academy Awards for their work in the film.\n\n\"cape fear\",\"cape fear clip\",\"cape fear trailer\",\"cape fear part 1\",\"cape fear theme\",\"cape fear 1991\",\"juliette lewis\",\"martin scorsese\",\"finger videos\",\"crime dramas\",\"crime thrillers\",drama,\"psychological thrillers\",suspense,\"steven spielberg\",\"robert de niro\",\"barbara de fina\",\"conflict videos\",\"innocence videos\",\"risk videos\",\"sex sensuality videos\",\"vengeance videos\",\"stage videos\",\"max cady\",\"danielle bowden\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++8064,/m/06cgy,/m/02g0mx", "title": "Cape Fear (4/10) Movie CLIP - Sucking Cady's Thumb (1991) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01T12:18:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "-579y5LyYIQ", "description": "Season 1 Opening", "title": "The Sleepover Club", "publishedDate": "2006-05-09T02:36:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "-57Ec0ad0LE", "description": "U.S. Vice President Joe Biden recently had some advice (delivered through the good offices of Parents magazine, of all things) for women who are afraid of crime. \"If you want to protect yourself, get a double-barrel shotgun,\" he said, during a Facebook video chat.\n\nThe vice president said he told his wife, Jill, that \"If there's ever a problem\" -- at their home in Wilmington -- \"just walk out on the balcony here, walk out, put that double-barrel shotgun and just fire two blasts outside the house.\" He went on, \"You don't need an AR-15. It's harder to aim. It's harder to use, and, in fact, you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself. Buy a shotgun. Buy a shotgun.\"\n\nHe later expanded on his theory of home defense in an interview with Field and Stream magazine. \"Well, you know, my shotgun will do better for you than your AR-15,\" he said, \"because you want to keep someone away from your house, just fire the shotgun through the door.\"\n\nBiden's advice is both generally and specifically bad. It is never a good idea for a woman, or a man, to fire shotgun blasts into the dark.\n\nIt is a particularly bad idea to fire a shotgun through a door. It is very specifically a bad idea for Jill Biden to fire a shotgun from her balcony into the dark because she might shoot a member of her husband's Secret Service detail.\n\nBut the vice president is one of the few Democratic politicians today who acknowledges, even implicitly, that the desire of millions of American citizens to participate in their own defense by arming themselves is both morally and practically legitimate.\n\nMany Democrats find joy in caricaturing gun owners -- even of the non-absolutist variety -- as mouth-breathing barbarians. This smug moralizing has become almost pathological.\n\nIt is also counterproductive, because demonizing the more than 40 percent of Americans who own guns (the vast majority of whom secure them responsibly) isn't an effective way to advance sensible legislation to regulate civilian-owned guns.\n\nThe gun-control debate after the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut has been mostly a non sequitur.", "title": "Following Biden's shotgun advice will  land in prison", "publishedDate": "2013-03-06T20:02:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "-57GCUGIqCc", "description": "My brother's teammate showed the ultimate in sportsmanship and compassion when he wrestled a boy with a disability who had never won a match.

It has a red-brown colour in clearance of thin layers while it is golden-yellow in vapours.Tellurium is used in producing lead alloys of enhanced ductility and durability. Such alloys are used in cables, for example. When 0.05 % tellurium is introduced then lead losses due to dissolution by sulphuric acid are reduced by 10 times. This property is used in the production of lead-acid storage batteries.Tellurium is also widely used in producing semiconductor materials, specifically lead tellurides, bismuth, antimony, and caesium. In the years coming the production of lanthanide tellurides, their alloys, and alloys with metal selenides will become very important. It will be used in producing thermoelectric generators with very high efficiency up to 72-78%. This will allow using them in power engineering and automobile industry.Many of you know Peltier thermoelectric modules which are used in portable refrigerators, thermoelectric generators, and sometimes in extreme cooling of computers. Bismuth telluride is the basic material of semiconductors in such modules. Nowadays it is the most widely used semiconducting material of Peltier modules. If you look at the side of a thermoelectric module you'll notice rows of small cubes. They are made of bismuth telluride.Cadmium-mercury-tellurium alloys have exceptional value. They have amazing properties for detecting radiation from blast-offs and surveying enemies from space through atmospheric windows. In this case cloudiness is not important. Cadmium-mercury-tellurium alloys are one of the most expensive materials in modern electronics industry.What concerns light sources tellurium is used for producing lamps containing its vapours.

Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is a television weatherman on a high-profile Chicago news program. Professionally, Dave is doing just fine -- he makes great money for a job that demands little effort, and he has a shot at an assignment with a network morning news and chat show. But Dave's personal life leaves a lot to be desired -- his father, respected author Robert Spritzel (Michael Caine), is in failing health, he's divorced from his wife, Noreen (Hope Davis), and his relationship with his children is tenuous at best, especially his overweight daughter, Shelly (Gemmenne de la Pena). If Dave is to land his new job, he'll have to move to New York City, and with his time in Chicago running short, he dedicates himself to trying to salvage his ties with his family before it's too late, though he discovers this is even harder than he imagines.\n\n\"the weather man\",\"the weather man clip\",\"the weather man 2005 trailer\",\"the weather man part 1\",\"nicolas cage\",\"michael caine\",\"gore verbinski\",\"cell phone videos\",\"cup videos\",\"spoon videos\",drama,\"william s beasley\",\"steve tisch\",\"norman golightly\",\"jason blumenthal\",\"todd black\",\"david alper\",\"frustration videos\",\"grief videos\",\"illness videos\",\"life and death videos\",\"parenthood videos\",\"chicago videos\",\"city videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++305227,/m/01vvb4m,/m/0gnbw", "title": "The Weather Man (2/9) Movie CLIP - Hit With A Frosty (2005) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-02-25T15:54:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "-5S5SQH2uV8", "description": "new modification, SR Lowering Springs on my mustang,\npanhard rod should be arriving thursday along with my camber bolts :)\n\nYES PAINTING SPOILER BLACK SOON !!! been busy :O\n\nnegative comments will be deleted, if you have something good to say thanks!! :)", "title": "2013 Mustang SR Performance Lowering Springs", "publishedDate": "2013-03-11T01:25:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-5S7avD3mwQ", "description": "FRENCH TRANSLATION QUIZ = radioprotection", "title": "FRENCH TRANSLATION QUIZ = radioprotection", "publishedDate": "2011-06-04T09:44:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "-5SDtG_xLKQ", "description": "Niels Geusebroek - We Are @Ruuddewild.nl\n\n538 YouTube: http://www.538.nl/youtube\n538Gemist: http://www.538.nl/gemist\nTV538: http://www.538.nl/tv\nFacebook: http://www.538.nl/facebook\nTwitter: http://www.538.nl/twitter\nInstagram: http://www.538.nl/instagram", "title": "Niels Geusebroek - We Are @Ruuddewild.nl", "publishedDate": "2014-10-01T16:32:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-5SNkcrWXvo", "description": "Mnemonic explains the branches of the axillary artery.

Orders are given that anyone who enters their private chamber would be beheaded and the King spends with Krishnasini's for months. Reports reach the ministers that the Sultans are planning to take advantage of the King's inaccessibility and launch a combined attack on Vijayanagaram. Worried at the state of affairs, Tenali Raman braves the prohibitory order and enters Krishnasini's abode dressed as a woman, but all his appeals to the King seem to fall on deaf ears. Meanwhile Queen Tirumalamba falls seriously sick and the King finally comes out of his daze. Once the King is at his wife's bedside, Tenali Ramakrishna \nmanages to gain entry into Krishnasini's house again, this time under the guise of an omniscient saint who assures \nher that he would bring the King back to her. He catches her red-handed with her gang of spies, and signals to the \nhidden soldiers to surround her. Realized that the game is up, Krishnasini prefers a dignified death. Shocked to see \nher stab herself, Timmarusu remonstrates with her that she has acted in haste, for the King would have certainly \nforgiven her.\n\nWatch more movies @\nhttp://www.youtube.com/volgavideo\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/newvolgavideo/videos?view=1", "title": "Tenali Ramakrishna Songs - Chandana Charchitha - ANR, NTR,  Chittor V.

Lovat was defeated at Culloden and convicted of treason against the British and was beheaded, on Tower Hill, the last person to be so in Britain.\n\n~\nOn the death of his cousin in 1698 Simon Fraser assumed the title of Lord Lovat, though it was many years before, with the help of Duncan Forbes of Culloden, he was able to secure the legal settlement of the estate. Thomas Carlyle described him as \"tall and stately (and might have been handsome in his youth), with a very flat nose. His manners were not disagreeable, though his address consisted chiefly in gross flattery and in the due application of money. He did not make on me the impression of a man of a leading mind. His suppleness and profligacy were apparent.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Culloden Lord Lovat took refuge in various hiding places on his own estates and eventually with Macdonald of Morar. By now lame he was captured on an island in Loch Morar in June 1746 and taken in stages to London. He was executed on Tower Hill on 9th April 1747. Lovat is said to have looked forward to his internment in the family vault at Kirkhill with all the pipers from John o' Groats to Edinburgh playing at his funeral. But the government refused to release his body for burial in Scotland.  \n\nLovat was, said Sir John Clerk, \"a man of bold, nimbling kind of sense, very vain of his clan, the Fraziers, and ready to sacrifice everything to their interest.\n\nHis son was eventually allowed to buy back the family's forfeited estates as a reward for raising two regiments and other service for the government.\n\nThe family was to maintain its military commitments. The 16th Lord Lovat played a key role in recruitment to the Scottish regiments for the First World War and was responsible for the strong links between the War Office and the Piobaireachd Society of which he was President from 1907 until his death in 1933.", "title": "Lord Lovat's Lament Bagpipes", "publishedDate": "2012-04-03T17:26:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "-5fRvbkZlJM", "description": "After visualization of the right nasal cavity a large fungus ball is seen which is filling the majority of the right sphenoid sinus.

Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family, nor are they from Guinea. They originated in the Andes, and earlier studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggested they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as Cavia aperea, C. fulgida, or C. tschudii and, therefore, do not exist naturally in the wild.[1][2] Recent studies applying molecular markers,[3][4] in addition to studying the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals,[5] revealed that the ancestor is most likely Cavia tschudii.\nThe guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture of many Indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.[6] Since the 1960s, efforts have been made to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.[7]\nIn Western societies, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature, their responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them, continue to make the guinea pig a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.\nBiological experimentation on guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were frequently used as a model organism in the 19th and 20th centuries, resulting in the epithet \"guinea pig\" for a test subject, but have since been largely replaced by other rodents such as mice and rats. They are still used in research, primarily as models for human medical conditions such as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy, and pregnancy complications.", "title": "Guinea pig  \u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8\u4e00\u5bb6", "publishedDate": "2014-02-24T09:14:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "-5hJ7NnoXH4", "description": "Chase has been sick for a week and he is starting to feel better but has Roseola \"rash\" all over his body.", "title": "Chase with Lil' G", "publishedDate": "2008-09-01T22:56:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "-5hqd0R-7C8", "description": "Concavity", "title": "Concavity", "publishedDate": "2012-04-30T02:53:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "-5htTqMKUkc", "description": "We have a number of trees here at the Seed Savers Centre in Byron Bay and find they vary in flavour.

Most frogs are characterized by a short body, webbed digits (fingers or toes), protruding eyes, bifid tongue and the absence of a tail. Frogs are widely known as exceptional jumpers, and many of the anatomical characteristics of frogs, particularly their long, powerful legs, are adaptations to improve jumping performance. Due to their permeable skin, frogs are often semi-aquatic or inhabit humid areas, but move easily on land. They typically lay their eggs in puddles, ponds or lakes, and their larvae, called tadpoles, have gills and tails to develop in water. Adult frogs follow a carnivorous diet, mostly of arthropods, annelids and gastropods. Frogs are most noticeable by their call, which can be widely heard during the night or day, mainly in their mating season.\n \nThe distribution of frogs ranges from tropic to subarctic regions, but most species are found in tropical rainforests. Consisting of more than 5,000 species described, they are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. However, populations of certain frog species are declining significantly.\n \nA popular distinction is often made between frogs and toads on the basis of their appearance, but this has no taxonomic basis. (Members of the anuran family Bufonidae are called true toads, but many species from other families are also called toads.) In addition to their ecological importance, frogs have many cultural roles, such as in literature, symbolism and religion, and they are also valued as food and as pets.\n\nA toad is any of a number of species of amphibians in the order Anura characterized by dry, leathery skin (usually pink and orange-coloured), short legs, and snout-like parotoid glands. A distinction between frogs and toads, though common in popular culture, is not made in taxonomy, where toads are spread across families Bufonidae, Bombinatoridae, Discoglossidae, Pelobatidae, Rhinophrynidae, Scaphiopodidae, and Microhylidae. A group of toads is called a knot.\n \nToads cannot transmit warts to people through handling or skin contact. The bumps on a toad's skin help the animal blend into its environment visually by breaking up its outline. Also, the parotoid gland is often mistaken for 'warts'. They are present on healthy specimens and are not a result of infection.", "title": "Fat Frog & Toad", "publishedDate": "2012-02-11T18:43:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "-5rc5C_JaeU", "description": "The song in Boiler Room Doom.\n\nTo view it in High Quality go here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5rc5C_JaeU&fmt=18", "title": "Crash Twinsanity OST - Boiler Room Doom", "publishedDate": "2008-12-22T23:13:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "-5s6Q6PW4gU", "description": "Highlight Freegun Air Spine - FISE World Andorra 2014", "title": "Highlight Freegun Air Spine - FISE World Andorra 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-07-10T13:35:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "-5sC9WO9Ve4", "description": "A brilliant way to defend your castle by tricking your Enemies troops!\nThe Troops Will see the keep as open but when they get to close the gatehouse will close shut on them!!!

Since the late 19th century, zombies have acquired notable popularity, especially in North American and European folklore.\n\nIn modern times, the term \"zombie\" has been applied to an undead being in horror fiction, largely drawn from George A.

For the EP, see Emma Dean (musician). For the Seinfeld episode, see The Face Painter.\n\nBody painted New Orleans Saints fan in the 2010 La Fete Body & Face Painting Festival\nBody painting, or sometimes bodypainting, is a form of body art. Unlike tattoo and other forms of body art, body painting is temporary, painted onto the human skin, and lasts for only several hours, or at most (in the case of Mehndi or \"henna tattoo\") a couple of weeks. Body painting that is limited to the face is known as face painting. Body painting is also referred to as (a form of) \"temporary tattoo\"; large scale or full-body painting is more commonly referred to as body painting, while smaller or more detailed work is generally referred to as temporary tattoos.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Indigenous body painting\n2 Western body painting\n2.1 Body painting festivals\n2.2 Fine art body painting\n2.3 Body painting in the commercial arena\n3 Face painting\n3.1 Use in military\n4 Glitter tattoos\n5 Body paints\n6 Hand art\n7 Media\n8 See also\n9 References\nIndigenous body painting[edit]\nBody painting with clay and other natural pigments existed in most, if not all, tribalist cultures. Often worn during ceremonies, it still survives in this ancient form among the indigenous people of Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific islands and parts of Africa. A semi-permanent form of body painting known as Mehndi, using dyes made of henna (hence also known rather erroneously as \"henna tattoo\"), was and is still practiced in India and the Middle East, especially on brides. Since the late 1990s, Mehndi has become popular amongst young women in the Western world.\n\nMany indigenous peoples of Central and South America paint Jagua Tattoos, or designs with Genipa americana juice on their bodies. Indigenous peoples of South America traditionally use annatto, huito, or wet charcoal to decorate their faces and bodies. Huito is semi-permanent, and it generally takes weeks for this black dye to fade.[1]\n\nActors and clowns around the world have painted their faces\u2014and sometimes bodies\u2014for centuries, and continue to do so today. More subdued form of face paints for everyday occasions evolved into the cosmetics we know today.\n\nWestern body painting[edit]\n\nA young woman with a butterfly painted over her breasts and chest\n\nBody painting at the Nakukymppi event in Padasjoki, Finland\nThere has been a revival of body painting in Western society since the 1960s, in part prompted by the liberalization of social mores regarding nudity and often comes in sensationalist or exhibitionist forms.[2] Even today there is a constant debate about the legitimacy of body painting as an art form. The current modern revival could be said to date back to the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago when Max Factor, Sr. and his model Sally Rand were arrested for causing a public disturbance when he body-painted her with his new make-up formulated for Hollywood films.[3] Body art today evolves to the works more directed towards personal mythologies, as Jana Sterbak, Rebecca Horn, Youri Messen-Jaschin or Javier Perez.\n\nBody painting is not always large pieces on fully nude bodies, but can involve smaller pieces on displayed areas of otherwise clothed bodies.\n\nBody painting led to a minor alternative art movement in the 1950s and 1960s, which involved covering a model in paint and then having the model touch or roll on a canvas or other medium to transfer the paint.

Laws vary from state to state, although they are generally very similar. The following guidelines, specific to California, will help you have a successful renting experience.\nHow Much of a Security Deposit Can a Landlord Charge, and Can They Refuse to Return it When the Tenant Moves Out?\nA landlord, under California Civil Code Section 1950.5, is not allowed to charge any more than two months' rent as a deposit for an unfurnished unit, and three months' rent for a completely furnished one. If you have paid your rent for each month that you have resided in the property and you wish to move without breaking a lease agreement, you should furnish the landlord with a thirty-day notice as a courtesy. The landlord has to advise you of your right to a preliminary inspection of the unit during the last two weeks before you move out. You should be present for this inspection and the landlord should give you a written list with repairs and expected costs if any are found. You, as the tenant, have the right to make any repairs yourself and clean the unit before you leave. In turn, if the landlord is attempting to charge you with damages or cleaning issues which you did not cause, or which were there when you moved in, you should inform the landlord of such, get any statements from witnesses who know this was not your responsibility, and take pictures before you move out.\nhttp://www.866eviction.com/ You may leave the keys in the unit when you vacate. Also, the landlord must return your security deposit within twenty-one days after the last day in which you resided on their property. Any legitimate repair deductions must be itemized and sent with your refund. If your landlord does not adhere to these rules regarding your security deposit, you may sue in small claims court.\nAs a Tenant, Can I Be Evicted Without Notice or Cause?\nThe eviction process is rather complicated and varies from state to state. However, the landlord may evict a tenant for nearly any reason if the proper procedures are followed. Some reasons which may cause you to be evicted even with a lease are: non-payment of rent, lease violations, obvious and purposeful damage, unlawful acts within or upon the premises, noise complaints, and interference with other tenants. Under any of these situations, a three-day notice is all that is necessary to remove a tenant from the unit. After notice is given, the landlord is required to give you an opportunity to correct the non-payment or the problem, and also give you complete contact information and hours in which to do so. It really does not help to attempt to hide from the landlord so that notice cannot be served, as it can be tacked to the door, dropped off at your place of work, or given to anyone at the residence over the age of 18. If you do not answer the notice and request a hearing to show just cause why you should not be evicted, the eviction will commence and you will be removed from the property. Your landlord must follow proper procedures, but it is possible that if you truly are not complying with the terms of your lease, not paying the rent, or conducting dangerous or illegal activities at the unit, you could face a lockout and removal by the sheriff's department.\nCan My Landlord Enter My Home Whenever They Wish?\nIn a word, no! Landlords to not have the right to simply drop in unannounced without a purpose, or even with one if the situation is not an emergency. Your landlord must make an appointment with you for a convenient time to perform repairs or an inspection of the premises. You do, however, need to comply with this request or after a reasonable period of time, the landlord has the right to enter anyway without your permission. The landlord also has the right to make an appointment with you to show potential buyers the property or potential renters if you are leaving or being evicted. The landlord must provide you with a twenty-four hour notice before entering to conduct normal business, and it must be during normal business hours, not in the middle of the night.\n\nFor More Information, visit: http://www.866eviction.com/\nCall us today at 866-Eviction / 1866-384-2846\nEmail Us at: info@866eviction.com\nWatch Video Again: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVjCPBbm0jk\nSubscribe to us: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_uKF4uIDcE5C2aLmfoPkLQ\nWatch other Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J1oR00N8jA\n\nIncoming Search Terms:\nCalifornia Renters Rights\nCalifornia Renters Rights Painting\nCalifornia Renters Rights Late Fees\nCalifornia Renters Rights Pest Control\nCalifornia Renters Rights 2012\nCalifornia Renters Rights Breaking A Lease\nCalifornia Renters Rights Foreclosure\nCalifornia Tenant Rights\nCalifornia Tenant Rights 30 Day Notice\nCalifornia Tenant Rights Eviction\nCalifornia Tenant Rights Breaking A Lease\nCalifornia Tenant Rights Deposit Return", "title": "California Renters Rights, Tenant Laws and Protection", "publishedDate": "2013-11-18T06:02:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "-6AWqxfp64s", "description": "Beckman Coulter UniCel Dxl 600 Immunoassay System", "title": "Beckman Coulter UniCel Dxl 600 Immunoassay System", "publishedDate": "2011-06-23T19:32:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "-6AodrD0GUw", "description": "Learn more about the Department of Geological Sciences at CU-Boulder and what it is like to study earth sciences at the foot of the Rocky Mountains in Boulder, Colorado.", "title": "Geological Sciences at CU-Boulder", "publishedDate": "2014-09-02T21:13:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-6AuiaZVPs8", "description": "Sometimes this form of Teosinte like plant will come out of the gene pool,ive heard explanations of why from botanists.

The game is about a group of \"terrorists\" who have traitors among them, out to kill everyone who's not a traitor.\n\nA small number of players is selected as Traitors, who have to kill all the Innocent players (ie. the rest of the players). Those innocents know they are in the majority, but they do not know who is Traitor and who is not.\n\nThe Traitors must use the element of surprise and their special equipment, if they are to succeed. The Innocent just have to survive, which means finding out who the Traitors are and killing them before they kill you. Of course everyone is holding a big gun, and everyone looks suspicious...\n\nFor the Innocent, knowledge is power: who is acting strangely? Who can be linked to evidence found on corpses? Who is still alive, even?\"\n\nGassy: http://www.youtube.com/user/gassymexican\nHutch: http://www.youtube.com/user/shaun0728\nChilled: http://www.youtube.com/user/CriousGamers\nNick - http://www.youtube.com/eatmydiction1\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/SeaNanners\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/SeaNannersPage\nTumblr: http://www.seananners.tumblr.com", "title": "LOST IN SPACE (Trouble in Terrorist Town)", "publishedDate": "2013-09-24T16:00:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "-6RID82Ru-k", "description": "Good luck to everyone out in Sochi from Channel 4\nWatch Channel 4's Hunted Dispatches on 4oD: http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/4od#3651833\nDownload your own extended mix of Gay Mountain here: http://www.channel4.com/programmes/bornrisky/articles/gay-mountain/gay-mountain", "title": "Gay Mountain | Channel 4", "publishedDate": "2014-02-06T13:49:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-6R_molp2-k", "description": "This video was shot on the last day of our Caribbean cruise aboard the Royal Caribbean Allure of the Seas cruise ship in which it encountered very rough seas when the ship passed through the Bermuda Triangle.

It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a size of 25 cm in length.\n\nAcanthurus nigroris is an endemic species in the Hawaiian Islands and Johnston Atoll,  Acanthurus nigros is valid for the species elsewhere in Oceania and the Great Barrier Reef. The genetic analyses, based on mtDNA cytochrome b sequences from a total of 544 Acanthurus nigroris samples, revealed a clear separation (d = 0.041) between individuals from the Hawaiian Archipelago and the rest of the Pacific indicating a cryptic species pair (Randall et al. submitted manuscript, DiBattista et al. 2011).\n\nRandall et al. (1993) recorded A. nigroris from Midway Atoll, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, as abundant outside the lagoon at depths of less than 2 to over 20 m. It is common and abundant in Hawaii after A. nigrofuscus and Z. flavescens. An average of 1600 kg/year is harvested in the Hawaiian commercial fishery (Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources unpub. data). This species is collected as an aquarium fish in West Hawaii. The total number of individuals caught from FY 2005-2009 was 1,099 with a total value of $1,453 (Walsh et al. 2010).\n\nDorsal spines (total): 9; Dorsal soft rays (total): 24-27; Anal spines: 3; Anal soft rays: 23 - 25. Color drab dark brown; spots on body located at the rear base of dorsal and anal fins. Black spot at rear base of dorsal fin not large, its greatest width more than 2 times in eye diameter.

In addition, he made the decision to request all cabinet members to stay in their posts and asked to meet both parties' leaders in Congress soon.\n\nJohnson also asked Jack Valenti, Bill Moyers, and Liz Carpenter to write a brief statement for him to read on the day's events, which he then edited slightly himself. At 6:10 pm, after landing at Andrews amid a crowd of Congressional leaders, he walked to an already prepared set of microphones and began his first public statement as president:\n\n    This is a sad time for all people. We have suffered a loss that cannot be weighed. For me, it is a deep personal tragedy. I know that the world shares the sorrow that Mrs. Kennedy and her family bear. I will do my best. That is all I can do. I ask for your help--and God's.\n\nAfterwards Johnson was said to have regretted delivering the remarks, believing he sounded harsh and strident.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inauguration_of_Lyndon_B._Johnson\n\nUnder John F. Kennedy presidential air travel officially entered the jet age.[17] He had used the Eisenhower-era jets for trips to Canada, France, Austria and the United Kingdom.[18] However, in October 1962, the administration purchased a Boeing C-137 Stratoliner, a modified long-range 707\u2014Special Air Mission (SAM) 26000.[19]\n\nThe Air Force had attempted a special presidential livery of their own design: a scheme in red and metallic gold, with the nation's name in block letters. Kennedy felt the aircraft appeared too regal, and, on advice from his wife, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, he contacted the French-born American industrial designer Raymond Loewy for help in designing a new livery and interiors for the VC-137 jet.[2] Loewy met with the president, and his earliest research on the project took him to the National Archives, where he looked at the first printed copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, and saw the country's name set widely spaced and in upper case in a typeface called Caslon. He chose to expose the polished aluminum fuselage on the bottom side, and used two blues; a slate-blue associated with the early republic and the presidency, and a more contemporary cyan to represent the present and future. The presidential seal was added to both sides of the fuselage near the nose, a large American flag was painted on the tail, and the sides of the aircraft read \"United States of America\" in all capital letters. Loewy's work won immediate praise from the president and the press. The VC-137 markings were adapted for the larger VC-25 when it entered service in 1990.[20]\n\nSAM 26000 was in service from 1962 to 1998, serving Presidents Kennedy to Clinton. On 22 November 1963, SAM 26000 carried President Kennedy to Dallas, Texas, where it served as the backdrop as the Kennedys greeted well-wishers at Dallas' Love Field. Later that afternoon, Kennedy was assassinated, and Vice President Lyndon Johnson assumed the office of president and took the oath of office aboard SAM 26000. At Johnson's request, the plane carried Kennedy's body back to Washington.[21] A decade later, SAM 26000 brought Johnson's own body home to Texas after his state funeral in Washington.[22][23]\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson used SAM 26000 to travel extensively domestically, and used it to visit troops in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. SAM 26000 served President Nixon on several groundbreaking overseas voyages, including his famous visit to the People's Republic of China in February 1972 and trip to the Soviet Union later that year, both firsts for an American president.[24] Nixon dubbed the plane the \"Spirit of '76\" in honor of the upcoming bicentennial of the United States, and that logo was painted on both sides of the plane's nose.[25]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "title": "JFK Assassination: Air Force One Transmission on November 22, 1963 - Part 2", "publishedDate": "2014-10-05T18:30:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-742CkTARcU", "description": "", "title": "Last Days of Humanity - Oozing Saprogenic Scrotal Liquids", "publishedDate": "2009-01-02T15:05:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "-749iOBAojY", "description": "Fortuna GAL/4P Louver Groover, mortise slots for shutters slats on two stiles at the same time.

Hence, EAE is a model of choice for researching the mechanisms of disease in MS and exploring new treatments for it. EAE can be induced in both mouse and rat by injecting myelin proteins such as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) emulsified with adjuvant. The clinical signs of the disease usually begin 12-14 days post EAE induction. In the attached videos, EAE has been induced in C57BL/6 mice according to the protocol explained elsewhere (1). Here and in the attached videos, I have shown you how to assign score to the EAE-affected mouse according to the observed clinical signs.\nScore 0: healthy mouse\nScore 1: limp tail only\nScore 2: waddling gait, fails the back flip test  \nScore 3: leg(s) dragging with some movement preserved\nScore 4: complete hind-limb paralysis\nScore 5: moribund, breathing labored\nReference\n1.
