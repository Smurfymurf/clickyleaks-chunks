Note that the skin over and medial to the acromion is supplied by the supraclavicular nerve, which is a branch of the cervical plexus. Supraclavicular nerves are usually blocked with the brachial plexus when an interscalene block is performed. This is because the local anesthetic invariably spills over from the interscalene space into the prevertebral fascia and blocks the branches of the cervical plexus. The classic interscalene block, is not recommended for hand surgery due to potential sparing of the inferior trunk and the lack of blockade of the C8 and T1 roots.\nTechnique\nAfter cleaning the skin with an antiseptic solution, 1 to 3 mL of local anesthetic is infiltrated subcutaneously at the determined needle insertion site.\nThe fingers of the palpating hand should be gently but firmly pressed between the anterior and middle scalene muscles to shorten the skin-brachial plexus distance. The skin over the neck can be very mobile, and care should be taken to stabilize the fingers as well as to stretch the skin gently between the two fingers to ensure accuracy in needle advancement and redirection. The palpating hand should not be allowed to move during the entire block procedure to allow for precise redirection of the needle when necessary. The needle is inserted 3-4 cm (approximately 2 finger-breadths) above the clavicle and advanced at an angle almost perpendicular to the skin plane .\nEquipment\nA standard regional anesthesia tray is prepared with the following equipment:\n Sterile towels and gauze packs\n 2x20-mL syringes containing local anesthetic\n A 3-mL syringe plus 25-gauge needle with local anesthetic for skin infiltration\n A 3.5-cm, 22-gauge, short-bevel insulated stimulating needle\n Peripheral nerve stimulator\n Sterile gloves; marking pen", "title": "Dr.Abofadi/Gaza strip  Interscalene Brachial Plexus Block", "publishedDate": "2014-02-17T07:19:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "9unUVXVjumY", "description": "I do not own any of the music to this game soundtrack.\nAll is owned by Perfect World Entertainment and Stairway Games.\n\nDownload Link:\n\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?px4ques2spz4km9\n\nFor the complete soundtrack, with every track, and in perfect quality, check out my thread - http://rustyhearts-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?t=214941", "title": "Rusty Hearts Soundtrack - Vivarium BGM (Download Link)", "publishedDate": "2011-11-15T02:59:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9unZmxJ2Ovw", "description": "Typhoon Neoguri weakened from its original status as a super typhoon but remained intense, with gusts of more than 250 km per hour (155 mph).

Mit maximal 264 Passagieren an Bord bietet dieses Schiff die intime Atmosph\u00e4re einer Privatyacht. Das exklusive Design verbindet Tradition und Innovation zu einem ganz besonderen Ganzen. Durch seine Gr\u00f6\u00dfe kann das Schiff auch H\u00e4fen befahren, die anderen Kreuzfahrtschiffen verwehrt sind.\n\nAuf der L'Austral hat man die Wahl zwischen sechs ger\u00e4umigen, elegant eingerichteten Kabinenkategorien, von denen fast alle \u00fcber einen privaten Balkon verf\u00fcgen. Selbst die kleinste Kabine bietet 18 m2 puren Luxus. Jede Kabinenkategorie bietet einen Rund-um-die-Uhr Zimmerservice, W-LAN Zugang, eine Klima-Anlage, ein Satelliten-Telefon und noch viele andere Annehmlichkeiten. \nF\u00fcr Familien stehen 3-Bett- oder miteinander verbundene Kabinen zur Verf\u00fcgung.\n\nDie L'Austral bietet exzellenten Service und kulinarische Gen\u00fcsse in 2 Restaurants: \"The Gastronomic Restaurant\", wo franz\u00f6sische Haute Cuisine, aber auch internationale Gerichte serviert werden, sowie das Grill Restaurant, in dem man unter freiem Himmel ein Buffet oder ein Themendinner genie\u00dfen kann.\n\nWie auf einer privaten Yacht, liegt die Entscheidung, wie man die Zeit verbringt, ganz bei den G\u00e4sten. Man kann z.B. die hochmodernen Ger\u00e4te im Fitnessbereich nutzen, oder  sich erfrischen, indem man in den Pool eintaucht. \nAnschlie\u00dfend kann man sich eine Auszeit g\u00f6nnen und sich was Gutes tun lassen: in Zusammenarbeit mit der renommierten Marke Sothys bietet das Beauty Centre Massagen, Sch\u00f6nheitsanwendungen, Friseur, Hamam und Balneotherapie. Wer Ruhe genie\u00dfen m\u00f6chte, kann sich aber auch in die Bibliothek oder die Internet-Ecke zur\u00fcckziehen. Und in den Lounges der L'Austral werden die G\u00e4ste unterhaltsame Shows und lehrreiche Vortr\u00e4ge finden. F\u00fcr besonders viel Spa\u00df sorgt auch der Game Bereich, wo man u.a. die M\u00f6glichkeit hat, mit Wii gegen Mitreisende zu spielen. \nAbends hei\u00dft es dann Vorhang auf im Theater:  Jeden Abend kann man eine andere meisterhafte Darbietung bewundern.

Artwork design by Khafra Rudder.\n\nThe grandest of entries with the first official solo single leading up to the impending Trinidad and Tobago carnival season 2015, is the amazing and unexplainably talented songstress Fay-Ann Lyons. Viqueen Fay-Ann has time and time again shown herself to be a true musician and superstar with her factory-like, hit-making countenance and abilities.\n\nThe culmination of various music styles and musical minds creating a masterpiece from what was once a blank canvas brings illumination to the otherwise dark galleria that is carnival.\n\nMorphing Soca with Electronic Dance Music has never been as fulfilling as it now is in the house of Ground Empire. \"RAZE\" a written project by Fay-Ann Lyons in which she highlights vocal abilities reminds us why she is Viqueen and why she remains amongst the best entertainers to do it in this new era.\n\nExercising a rare type of skill, STADIC, formerly as KC, breathes life to the music which complements and transforms the celestially hypnotic vocals of Viqueen Fay-ann.

This stunning realization is now supported by considerable emerging evidence detailed in this article. At the same time, the \"vanished\" Boeing 777 may also be in a hanger in Iran right now, being retrofitted with nuclear weapons and turned into a suicide bomb to be deployed over a major city in the Middle East. This possibility is discussed in detail, below, with supporting evidence.\n\nImage: Malaysia Airlines (YouTube).\n\nThe idea that Flight 370 passengers and crew may still be alive is not a bizarre theory. Even Reuters is now reporting that U.S. authorities have stated, \"...it's also possible the plane may have landed somewhere.\"\n\nHere's the evidence in support of this emerging \"piracy\" theory of what may have happened to Flight 370 and why the people who may have diverted it might also be planning on turning it into a weapon:\n\nFive critical pieces of astonishing supporting evidence that Flight 370 passengers may still be alive\n\nPlease understand that I do not wish to create false hope for all those families who have greatly suffered through this ordeal. My heart goes out to them, and we can only hope these 239 passengers and crew are, indeed, being kept alive somewhere to be used as a bargaining chip for ransom or political purposes. Here's the substantial evidence in support of this theory:\n\nAddressing the threat posed by plans by the United States to install a missile defense system in Europe, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin today asserted that Russia would respond with nuclear weapons if it was targeted by conventional American missiles.\n\nImage: Deputy PM Dmitry Rogozin (Wikimedia Commons).\n\nRogozin's comments arrive just a day after President Vladimir Putin called on Russia to upgrade its weapons systems in order to repel U.S. plans to institute the EPAA missile shield in Europe, which is ostensibly designed to counter Iran's nuclear build-up yet is also firmly pointed at Russia.\n\nAsserting that Russia was \"preparing a response\" to the U.S. missile defense system, Rogozin warned, \"They may experiment with conventional weapons on strategic delivery platforms, but they must bear in mind, that if we are attacked, in certain circumstances we will of course respond with nuclear weapons.\"\n\nDuring a press conference in the Netherlands today, Obama said he is more worried about Manhattan getting nuked than any supposed threat posed by Russia.\n\nThe president made the remark after a reporter asked him if former challenger Mitt Romney was correct in his assertion that Russia is once again the primary foe of the United States following Crimeans voting to rejoin Russia. u.s. \"united states\" usa america weapon nuclear nuke control missile \"nuclear missile\" army \"u.s. army\" order presidential power powerful mission discipline security \"air force\" \"royal air force\" perfection leader leadership culture combat force mission job agency responsibility money old new tech technology war ww3 \"world war 3\" helicopter 2014 2015 underground bunker troops \"u.s. air force\" launch elite \"elite nwo agenda\" humanity survival prepare \"survival supplies\" alex jones infowars rant crazy gerald celente trends in the news g4t glenn beck coast to coast am we are change anonymous truther conspiracy illuminati end game the road false flag attack demcad shtf bugout\n\n\"Russia's actions are a problem. They don't pose the No. 1 national security threat to the United States. I continue to be much more concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan,\" Obama said.\n\nNorth Korea has threatened to nuke the United States on several occasions.

The gig is a pronged and barbed spearhead forged out of steel. It is attached to the end of a long pole and used to spear fish. Gig fishing at night is an old tradition in Shannon County, and a good gig, such as the one Ray Hicks is making, is a prized possession. Like many hunting and fishing traditions, gig fishing grew out of the necessity to eat and feed one's family. After working all day in the timber or at farming, men would go out on the rivers at night and fish. Night gigging is done from special flat-bottomed boats rigged with gaslights. The boat has to be able to navigate shallow waters, yet be heavy and stable enough not to move from under the gigger when the gig is thrown. The gig itself must be shaped and tempered just right. The gig has to pass through a fish without tearing the fish apart and the barbs must hold the fish tightly enough to pull it out of the water, yet cleanly release the fish into the boat when the pole is given a quick jerk. The gig also has to be flexible enough not to break when it hits rocks, but hard enough to hold its point. It takes many hours, a lot of hard work, and considerable skill to make a gig. The metal must be heated to different temperatures depending on the task. Welding, which fuses the metal, requires the highest temperatures; simple bending requires the lowest. Hicks can work on the gig only a minute or two at a time before having to reheat it in the forge. This series of camera rolls shows all of the steps involved in making a gig form beginning to end. The rolls are numbered in the order they were shot. Footage shot on June 7, 1979, in Shannon County, Missouri. \n\nPart of the raw footage recorded 1978-1979 for the 1981 documentary motion pictures \"Shannon County: Home\" and \"Shannon County: Hearts of the Children.\" Located in Special Collections, Meyer Library, Missouri State University.\n\nFor more information on the Shannon County Film Digitization Project: http://purl.missouristate.edu/library/archives/shannon/scfindingaid", "title": "Camera Roll 368 - Shannon County Film Digitization Project", "publishedDate": "2014-05-06T23:39:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "9v0rAneRth8", "description": "", "title": "Singapore to Ulaanbaatar Train ride from Hohhot to Erlian Part 2", "publishedDate": "2012-07-20T09:22:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9v0thYi2kgQ", "description": "Symptoms of autoimmune thyroid disease include a heart that starts racing, weight loss, nervousness, sweating and diarrhea.

It is made by infusing German chamomile (Matricaria recutita), a member of the sunflower family, in hot water. Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) is also beneficial, but most research has been done on German chamomile and it is the most commonly used in teas.\nHere are eight health benefits of this popular tea:\nBetter Sleep:Chamomile tea's most well-known benefit is as a sleep aid. It is known for its relaxing and soothing properties and is often taken before bed to promote restful sleep.\nStomach Soother:Peter Rabbit's mother was right to give him chamomile after he ate too much in Mr. McGregor's vegetable garden. Chamomile is helpful for a variety of stomach problems. It soothes stomach aches, eases the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, promotes elimination, and assists in overall digestion. It is often found in teas for digestion in combination with peppermint.\nMenstrual Cramps:The ancient Egyptians used it to soothe menstrual cramps and now science is catching up. One study found that drinking chamomile tea raised urine levels of glycine, a compound that calms muscle spasms. Researchers believe this is why chamomile tea helps menstrual cramps.\nHemmorrhoid Help:One study found that chamomile ointment was helpful in the treatment of hemorrhoids.\nCold Fighter:Chamomile has immune boosting properties and helps in the fight against colds due to its antibacterial properties.\nWound Healing:The Egyptians, Romans, and Greeks used chamomile flowers in a poultice and applied them to wounds to speed healing. They must've been on to something. In one study, rats given chamomile extract in their water experienced faster wound healing times.\nDiabetes Management:Chamomile tea is being studied for its beneficial effects in the management of diabetes. In one study, daily consumption of chamomile tea was found to prevent the progression of diabetic complications and hyperglycemia.\nCancer:In-vitro studies show possible protection against several different types of cancer cells.", "title": "Benefits Of Chamomile Tea.flv", "publishedDate": "2011-07-19T10:26:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vCbPq_orXI", "description": "Frog Frenchie Fun French Bulldog Puppy Argues Bedtime\n\nTo see more cute frenchies go to\nwww.frogfrenchiefun.weebly.com", "title": "Frog Frenchie Fun French Bulldog Puppy Argues Bedtime", "publishedDate": "2011-10-04T17:31:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vClUdO7gzc", "description": "Brought to you by Harcourts Cornerstone\nhttp://www.cornerstone.harcourts.co.za\n\nView more details on this property on Property24 http://www.property24.com/for-sale/southernwood/east-london/eastern-cape/6580/101748748\nTo view videos of similar listings in Southernwood please visit http://www.propertytube.com/channel/harcourts-cornerstone-south-africa-3935\n\nProperty Description\n\nQuaint little house in a quiet area of Southernwood, makes it an appealing first time home for small family.

The Seattle-based airline says a concerted effort to develop sustainable aviation biofuels is critical. Two new reports find that if policy makers take action, locally-grown sustainable biofuels can become a viable industry to power air travel. \n\nFor years, Bill Glover, Boeing's environmental guru, has flown around the world trying to sow the seeds for sustainable aviation biofuels. \n\nNow, Glover, who's based in Seattle, says he's convinced one solution is right in his backyard.\n\n\"It's our belief that local and regional efforts are going to be the way this gets going,\" said Glover as he helped unveiled the results of a 10-month study into the feasibility of an aviation biofuels industry in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.\n\n\"There's absolutely capacity. There's a great deal of potential in this region of the world,\" Glover said. \n\nSteve Camp, a farmer in Washington state, harvests acres of camelina seeds that he processes into biofuels. \"This can be done, this really can be done. I'm very encouraged. I think it's a very viable project,\" says Camp. \n\n\"We've done a lot to improve efficiency. But efficiency can only go so far and we need to look at this alternative source of jet fuel to continue that progress.\" Bill Ayer, Alaska Airlines Chairman and CEO \n\nSustainable Aviation Fuels Northwest - a group that includes Boeing, Alaska Airlines, Washington State University, and the region's three largest airports - looked at all aspects of implementing a supply chain for aviation biofuels and found potential with a portfolio of feed stocks: oil seeds like camelina; algae; forest residue; and solid waste.\n\n\"Fuel is now our number one cost,\" says Bill Ayer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alaska Airlines. \"We've done a lot to improve efficiency. But efficiency can only go so far and we need to look at this alternative source of jet fuel to continue that progress.\" \n\nCSIRO, Australia's national science agency, conducted a similar study and found that Australia and New Zealand also show promise for hosting an industry that harnesses non-food biomass sources. \n\nCSIR's report predicts that over the next 20 years a sustainable aviation fuels industry could cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17 per cent, generate more than 12,000 jobs and reduce Australia's reliance on aviation fuel imports by $2 billion annually. \n\n\"It's our belief that local and regional efforts are going to be the way this gets going because feed stocks vary from place to place, because processing capability varies, because public policy varies.\" Bill Glover, Boeing Vice President of environment and aviation policy integration \n\nThe study was commissioned by and developed in collaboration with members of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group- including Air New Zealand, Boeing, Qantas and Virgin Australia. \n\nGlover, Boeing's vice president of environment and aviation policy integration, says numerous test flights have already shown biofuels perform better than traditional jet fuel. Now, the challenge is figuring out how to ramp up production.\n\nGlover says local is the way to go \"because feed stocks vary from place to place, because processing capability varies, because public policy varies.\"\n\nIndustry leaders say it's on the public policy front where they need the most help to establish a flight path for a sustainable industry.\n\n\"We need some new early policy support to get this moving, to encourage the investment that's going to be required to build the infrastructure so we have an alternative fuel available at a competitive price,\" Ayer said.\n\n\"To make sustainable aviation biofuels economically viable, we need some financing help in the form of loan guarantees and such to get some initial capability at scale in place. We need some long-term off take agreements so that we establish there is a place to sell this into. We need some scale-up of feed stocks and some research and development associated with those to improve the productivity,\" said Glover. \n\nResults from several biofuels test flights have shown that bio-derived fuels perform better than petroleum-based jet fuel. The challenge is figuring out how to move beyond making a few batches at a time, which is expensive, and ramping up to full-scale production. \n\nSource : Boeing Feauture Story\n\nAltumkell Productions 2011", "title": "New Studies show Flight Path for Aviation Biofuels", "publishedDate": "2011-05-28T03:44:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vIm72be4kM", "description": "Song aus dem Album: The Good Weed", "title": "Cookie The Herbalist feat  Cali P   Cyaan Stop", "publishedDate": "2009-10-29T19:47:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vIpdLK2yq4", "description": "Lyrics:\n\nI've got that Scouting Spirit\n\nUp in my head, up in my head, up in my head\n\nI've got that Scouting Spirit\n\nUp in my head, up in my head, to stay.\n\n \n\nI've got that Scouting Spirit\n\nDeep in my heart, Deep in my heart, Deep in my heart,\n\nI've got that Scouting Spirit\n\nDeep in my heart, deep in my heart, to stay.\n\n \n\nI've got that Scouting Spirit\n\nDown in my feet, down in my feet, down in my feet\n\nI've got that Scouting Spirit\n\nDown in my feet, down in my feet, to stay.\n\n \n\nI've got that Scouting Spirit\n\nAll over me, all over me, all over me\n\nI've got that Scouting Spirit\n\nAll over me, all over me, to stay.", "title": "Scouting Spirit \u2022 Scout Songs", "publishedDate": "2012-04-26T06:37:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vJ5U7Wqqcw", "description": "this is comedy clip from stephen chows fight back to school 2.........:)\nsubscribe for more..", "title": "Stephen Chow very funny judo scene", "publishedDate": "2012-07-18T11:39:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vJf9xerwpw", "description": "Umbilical Fetal Strangulation", "title": "Umbilical Fetal Strangulation - 12 Horas", "publishedDate": "2009-02-22T01:10:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vKHQi5HJ00", "description": "TV commercial", "title": "Bay Alarm CutRate", "publishedDate": "2010-06-02T23:40:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vKQpxf53wY", "description": "Download the mp3 4 free @ http://mug.gs/2/emusic", "title": "Count Yates- Chimpanzee", "publishedDate": "2010-06-16T15:07:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vKkOJzSmaM", "description": "Kaplan ACT and SAT teacher and online tutor James provides a helpful lesson and tutorial on how to get more points on the SAT Writing section & ACT English section using Kaplan test-taking strategies.

It surrounds Nahuel Huapi Lake in the foothills of the Patagonian Andes. The largest of the national parks in the region, it has an area of 7,050 km2 (2,720 sq mi), or nearly 2 million acres. Its landscapes represent the north Patagonian Andean Zone consisting of three types, namely, the Altoandino (with perpetual snow above an altitude of 1,600 metres (5,200 ft)), the Andino-Patag\u00f3nico (in the lower reaches of the hills) and the Patagonian steppe. I't also represents small parts of the Valdivian Rainforest. The park and the reserve lie at an altitude of 720-3,574 metres (2,360-11,726 ft), and are designated under IUCN management categories II (National Park) and IV (Management Reserve). The park is completely protected while the reserve is partially protected. The national park is dominated by the high mountain chain of the Andes, many lakes, rapid rivers, waterfalls, snow-clad peaks, glaciers and extensive forests. It is bordered by Chile on its western side. The park covers approximately 7,050 square kilometres (2,720 sq mi). It is located in the southwest section of the Neuqu\u00e9n and northwest section of the R\u00edo Negro provinces, bordering with Chile. The park has two zones: the park and the natural reserve with development concentrated in the reserve. The largest city and a base for tourism is San Carlos de Bariloche, which is surrounded by the park. San Carlos de Bariloche is the main hub when visiting the lake, and is known as the \"Gateway to Patagonia\", the \"Chocolate Capital\" and the \"Honeymoon Capital\" of Argentina. However, the city and other settlements are zoned outside the limits of the park. A further subzoning into the north, south and southern zones has been implemented with an exclusive recreational area named the Cerro Cathedral. Villa La Angostura is another lakeside resort also within the boundaries of the park. The area is known as the Argentine Lake District, as there are many lakes in the park, including Nahuel Huapi, Mascardi, Guti\u00e9rrez, Traful, Guillelmo, and Perito Moreno Lakes. Cerro Catedral is a 2,388 metres (7,835 ft) high peak within the park and an important ski resort. Cerro Tronador, on the Chilean border, is the highest mountain in the park at 3,491 metres (11,453 ft). Bordering the park to the north is the Lan\u00edn National Park. Geological formations in the park and the reserve are generally tertiary rocks of volcanic origin coupled with andacites and porphyrys. The cliffs of the San Pedro Peninsula depict eroded glacial features and the lakes also show many glacial effects. The park has widely varying climatic conditions with the annual precipitation ranging between 300 and 500 millimetres (12 and 20 in). It rains more towards the Chilean border. Lake Nahuel Huapi is the largest and deepest clear water lake in the lake district of Argentina, with a depth of 425 metres (1,394 ft), . Located at the foot of the Andes Mountains at an altitude of 767 metres (2,516 ft), it measures 544 square kilometres (210 sq mi). The lake was discovered by the Jesuit priest Nicol\u00e1s Mascardi in 1670 who also built a chapel on the Huemul Peninsula of the lake. The lake extends 100 kilometres (62 mi) across the border with Chile, and includes many fjords and the Valdivian temperate rain forest. The southern shore of the lake has many hotels and restaurant catering to the tourist industry. The Quetrihu\u00e9 Peninsula in the north of the lake has been set aside as a separate national park, Los Arrayanes National Park. The lake has many islands. The Forest Research station is located on one of them, Victoria Island, which is a natural reserve approachable by boats. Huemul Island hosted the Huemul Project, the Argentinean secret research project on nuclear fusion in 1949-1952. The park's ecology consists of Patagonian steppe at lower elevations and Valdivian temperate forests at higher elevations. It is notable for its rich wildlife due to its many biotopes, attributed to the varied altitude and precipitation range. Xerophytic Patagonian flora is dominant in the eastern half of the park while the western half is covered profusely with temperate rain forests. The dominant tree species in the park are the lengas, coihue, and the \u00f1ires. Other varieties of trees seen in the park are the Chilean cedar (Austrocedrus chilensis), Winter's bark (Drimys winteri), Myrceugenella apiculata, Lomatia ferruginea, Lomatia hirsuta, Alstroemeria aurantica, Fuchsia megellanica, bamboo Chusquea culcou, Mitraria cocinea and Embothrium coccineum.", "title": "Black Glacier, Nahuel Huapi National Park, R\u00edo Negro and Neuqu\u00e9n provinces, Argentina, South America", "publishedDate": "2014-02-10T11:40:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vkJrJlqdDg", "description": "To grow irises, plant three bulbs in a triangle three inches deep in a sunny or partially shady area of a garden.

Starting out in the 1970s, it carried out attacks on Western targets in Turkey but hasn't received much attention. The suicide bomber that carried out Friday's attack was previously arrested in 1997 in connection with rocket attacks on a police station and a military officers' club. He was released from prison after a hunger strike did severe damage to his brain. The group's suicide attackers often have incurable diseases.\n\n\"Syria has provided a lot of facilities to this group, including camps, ammunition, etc. They had a really close relationship with Syrian intelligence,\" said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a Turkish terrorism expert.\n\nOzcan also said that the Assad regime restored its links to the group after Turkey began harboring Syrian rebels. DHKP-C has organized pro-Assad rallies in Turkey and has used its agents, including some posing as journalists, to spread false rumors of Syrian refugees in Turkey committing murder and other misdeeds.\n\nTurkey has arrested 85 DHKP-C members since January and charged 55 last week with planning to kill government officials and attack embassies. Some members are accused of sharing state secrets with Greece and Syria.\n\nThe DHKP-C has taken credit for the bombing and explicitly said it was in response to Turkey's policy towards Assad. It claimed that \"Syrian collaborationist looters are trained and armed on our [Turkish] land and are sent back to massacre Syrian people.\" It stated that the U.S. is its number one enemy and Turkey was assisting its \"imperialist\" plans.\n\nA DHKP-C splinter group called Acilciler, or \"Urgent Ones,\" has about 500 members and operates from Syria under the name of the \"Hatay Liberation Army.\" Its leader, Mihrac Ural, is in Latakia. In the past, he has worked closely with the Kurdish Marxist terrorist group, the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has also received Syrian backing.\n\nIran reportedly hired DHKP-C in 2010 to stroke public unrest in Turkey in an attempt to stop the constitutional referendum. However, there should be skepticism towards this accusation. Iran praised the passing of the constitutional amendments, which made Turkey more democratic and strengthened the ability of the ruling Islamist party to push its agenda.\n\nHenri Barkey, a former State Department official and professor, doubts that Syria contracted DHKP-C to carry out the bombing. He says the group is cultish and wouldn't do the bidding of someone else. Assad's involvement in a terrorist attack against a U.S. target could also backfire and stir up American support for the rebels and ASssad's ouster.\n\nIt wouldn't be out of character for Assad to sponsor a terrorist attack simply out of rage. After all, his thugs are known for deliberately targeting children, torturing political prisoners and all sorts of heinous crimes that would be unthinkable to any moral person. Secret documents published by Al-Arabiya indicate the regime was behind a fire at a mall in Qatar that killed 19 people, 13 of them children.\n\nIf Assad was behind this terrorist attack in Turkey, then it could mean that he's decided to launch a wave of reprisal attacks against his enemies. The attempted transfer of anti-aircraft missiles to Hezbollah, foiled by Israel's air strike last week, could be the result of such a decision.", "title": "Mahsun kirmizigul taksim olaylarina destek vermedi", "publishedDate": "2013-06-11T22:40:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vmhLVr0Ivg", "description": "Historia de magia y fantas\u00eda en la que la joven Alicia se sumerge en el sorprendente Pa\u00eds de las Maravillas y conoce a extraordinarios personajes como Tweedledee y Tweedledum, el Sombrerero Loco, La Reina de Corazones y el fren\u00e9tico Conejo Blanco.

The success of their TV show allows Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) to finally move out of their parents' homes, but now they have to figure out what to do with their lives. Wayne's girlfriend, up-and-coming rock star Cassandra (Tia Carrere), is enjoying a career boost thanks to her new manager Bobby Cohn (Christopher Walker), but Garth thinks that Bobby is more interested in her body than her place on the charts. Meanwhile, Wayne is visited in a dream by the late Jim Morrison (Michael A. Nickles), who convinces him to promote a massive rock festival, \"Waynestock,\" featuring Aerosmith as headliners. Garth, on the other hand, is finally relieved of his pesky virginity by femme fatale Honey Hornee (Kim Basinger), though it turns out that Honey has a hidden agenda. Drew Barrymore, Harry Shearer, and Charlton Heston play cameo roles in Wayne's World 2, and Jay Leno, Rip Taylor, and Todd Rundgren appear as themselves.\n\n\"wayne's world 2\",\"wayne's world 2 clip\",\"wayne's world 2011\",\"wayne's world 2 trailer\",\"wayne's world 2 part 1\",\"mike myers\",\"kevin pollak\",\"dana carvey\",\"olivia dabo\",\"stephen surjik\",comedy,\"hard rock heavy metal\",\"rock pop\",\"showbiz comedies\",\"lorne michaels\",\"hawk koch\",\"barnaby thompson\",\"dinah minot\",\"embarrassment videos\",\"office videos\",\"wayne campbell\",\"garth algar\",\"betty jo\",\"jerry segel\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++119905,/m/0pz04,/m/0p__8,/m/02lf1j,/m/036gdw", "title": "Wayne's World 2 (4/10) Movie CLIP - The Partial Ocular Albino (1993) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-09T16:37:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vvuLAl99ec", "description": "This is off of his upcoming mixtape No Genre which drops on 12-7-10\nFollow B.o.B on Twitter www.twitter.com/bobatl\nwww.bobatl.com", "title": "B.o.B - Beast Mode - Video", "publishedDate": "2010-11-18T01:07:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vvz6QVbWZo", "description": "Comrade X (1940) - Trailer", "title": "Comrade X (1940) - Trailer", "publishedDate": "2012-06-29T17:49:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "9vvz_nUHfwE", "description": "Talented Horse Artist Cholla paints in hot summer with woman assistant.

Why? Because it's about consuming and purely temporary enjoyment. And there is a time and a place for these things. But when we build an entire life around these things the consequences of an unsustainable life come to bear. And it's not about the future. That is just when the results become the most obvious. The results of an unsustainable life for the future are merely the results of what living out of our design now so whether or not we realize it we can tell if we are living to our full satisfaction by looking to the future. And we can not base our definition of \"satisfied\" on just how we feel because you don't know what you don't know. Which is why we spend our lives so busy and numb -- so we don't have to think about it. \n\nDownload the song for FREE!\nhttps://soundcloud.com/teenshelter/why-sustainability-is\n\nTED Talk\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo5cKRmJaf0\n\nWikipedia Link on Sustainability\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "title": "Why Sustainability is Important", "publishedDate": "2014-02-06T05:19:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "9w9Ed9eNr3g", "description": "We offer affordable Sonoma County Waste Disposal Service for anything you need removed.

Angler: Capt. Jeff Sayre of www.flyfishingthevineyard.com. Boat Captain: Eric Obeck. Location is Boca Grande, FL. May 15, 2010\n\nAfter a great fight with several jumps, a hooked tarpon throws itself AT the bow of the boat and then is attacked by a bull shark. Per Captain Obeck's instructions, angler Jeff Sayre breaks the tarpon off, so it can escape, but TWO BULL SHARKS then pin the tarpon AGAINST the side of the boat and attack it. They literally hit the boat. There is a pause....but the sharks have pushed the crippled tarpon under the boat. They then attack it again and BOTH SHARKS fight over it, in a spray of blood and scales, as other boats watch. Quite a demonstration of raw nature. Thanks to Eric Obeck for a GREAT 3 days of tarpon fishing!  -Wilson Kerr\n\nPS: I do NOT recommend swimming near Boca Grande Pass in May.\nPPS: The lure pictured at the end is from www.gotstryper.com and yes, tarpon eat them up.", "title": "TWO Giant Bull Sharks ATTACK.

His utterly dark, modern, highly detailed work allows one to submerge into the world of 'Brutbiental Narkogorium' and bring to life visual stimulus which perfectly complements album's musical and conceptual side.\n\nAn unique musical work on today's bass/dubstep/ambient scene -- modern, intelligent, dark and brilliantly executed.

A Novi, in particolare, priva di acqua potabile da tre giorni proprio a causa del maltempo, l'ospedale \u00e8 allagato e i pazienti sono stati trasferiti ai piani superiori. E' stato transennato un sottopasso in via Verdi, dove tre auto sono rimaste bloccate dall'acqua. In salvo i guidatori. Via Oneto, dietro il Castello, si \u00e8 trasformata in un fiume di fango. Il sindaco ha annunciato che, anche domani, tutte le scuole e gli asili resteranno chiusi. La Protezione civile riferisce che a Novi, ma anche a Tortona, tutti i sottopassi sono allagati. \"La situazione \u00e8 davvero critica - dice il sindaco di Novi, Rocchino Muliere - mezza citt\u00e0 \u00e8 allagata, stiamo affrontando le emergenze ma \u00e8 davvero una situazione pesante. I tre sottopassi sono allagati, moltissime strade in direzione Alessandria sono sommerse dall'acqua. E' pesantemente interessata anche la zona artigianale, la strada che arriva da Serravalle, la zona della Pieve. L'ospedale \u00e8 invece operativo: abbiamo solo chiuso il reparto di Rianimazione, mentre l'idrovora sta liberando dall'acqua i magazzini\". Per il primo cittadino \"le previsioni meteo non erano cos\u00ec allarmanti, non ci aspettavamo una situazione del genere e, oltretutto, continua a piovere\". \n\nL'emergenza \u00e8 arrivata ad Alessandria: il sindaco ha ordinato, nel primo pomeriggio di oggi, lo sgombero delle abitazioni lungo il Bormida e ha chiuso il ponte sul fiume.\nAd Arquata Scrivia, in via Erta, una collina \u00e8 franata dietro una palazzina che \u00e8 stata evacuata. Frane segnalate anche a Gavi, dove \u00e8 saltata la corrente elettrica in alcune zone: una persona bloccata in auto \u00e8 stata salvata, le strade sono impraticabili e il campo sportivo \u00e8 invaso dal Lemme, che \u00e8 esondato. E' proprio Gavi, sulla destra del torrente Lemme alla confluenza con il rio Neirone, il paese pi\u00f9 colpito dall'ondata di maltempo. Ci sono una ventina di persone sfollate dalle frazioni vicine, tra cui un ferito lieve,ora ospitate nella palestra della scuola elementare. Via Bertelli, che collega Gavi a Serravalle, \u00e8 invasa dall'acqua. Localit\u00e0 Valle \u00e8 isolata e in localit\u00e0 Fabbrica e in zona Vallemme, verso San Cristoforo, la strada \u00e8 invasa da un metro d'acqua. E' stata una vera e propria bomba\nd'acqua quella che si \u00e8 abbattuta questa mattina su Gavi: in sei ore sono caduti 380 millimetri di pioggia, con un picco di 92 mm in una sola ora. Il torrente Orba, a Casal Cermelli, ha superato di un metro e 80 centimetri la soglia del pericolo.La Protezione civile di Alessandria, sul suo account Twitter, sta informando in tempo reale la popolazione di tutto il basso Piemonte.\nLe Ferrovie stanno allestendo bus sostitutivi tra Genova e Ovada: anche per il traffico ferroviario, infatti, ci sono gravi problemi, con guasti e ritardi sulla Milano-Genova tra Arquata Scrivia e Tortona, e sulla Torino-Genova tra Arquata e Novi Ligure. Due treni con circa 50 passeggeri sono bloccati per l'allagamento dei binari sul tratto Acqui Terme-Genova a Campo ligure e a Rossiglione. Sono  in corso le operazioni per il trasbordo su autobus ma le difficolt\u00e0 sono accresciute dalle strade allagate. Chiusa anche la linea Genova-Milano ad Arquata Scrivia per esondazione di un torrente. \nProblemi, oltre che sull'autostrada A7 che \u00e8 stata chiusa, anche sull'A26 Voltri-Gravellona Toce per una frana che si \u00e8 abbattuta in prossimit\u00e0 di Masone. Sul posto sta arrivando il personale dei vigili del fuoco e della polizia stradale. Il traffico in quel tratto \u00e8 particolarmente rallentato e si procede su un'unica corsia di marcia.\nE' allarme anche nel Verbano-Cusio-Ossola: una frana di notevoli proporzioni si \u00e8 staccata dalla montagna e ha invaso la strada provinciale della valle Strona, tra gli abitati di Canova e Prelo, nel comune  di Germagno. Un'auto in transito \u00e8 stata travolta: sono stati i due occupanti, illesi, a dare l'allarme. Isolata la parte alta della valle Strona. Sul nord del Piemonte le piogge hanno superato oggi i 110 millimetri. A Mergozzo alle ore 12 era gi\u00e0 stati raggiunti i 125 millimetri, a Cannobio 111. Forti rovesci hanno interessato anche la Valsesia: a Varallo 80 millimetri di acqua nella mattinata.\n\nNelle prossime ore, informa la Protezione civile, la situazione sar\u00e0 ancora caratterizzata da precipitazioni diffuse con picchi molto forti su Alessandrino, Verbano, Novarese, Vercellese.

Isn't it the same as translation?\n\nHi! I'm Neil Payne. One of the ways we like to communicate with our clients is through video. And every now and again what we'll do is we'll collect together a whole group of FAQs and answer them on video and put them out on the World Wide Web, obviously to our clients. So what's today's question?\n\nRight, a question we get asked a lot is \"What is localisation?\" There seems to be a lot of confusion about translation, localisation, transcreation, globalisation, internationalisation... there's lots of --sation's out there. But just to give you a summary of what localisation is: localisation is not translation. Translation can be part of a localisation process. Localisation is about taking anything, so we are talking websites, we can be talking apps, we can be talking even chairs and desks, we can be talking advertising campaigns. Anything. Anything that you want to take and put in a country or a culture that's foreign to where it was produced, or made or created, that will go through a process of localisation. Very simple localisation: think of food ingredients. If you're going to be selling your food product in another country, you have to localise the ingredients; not only in the language, but according to the legal requirements of that country as well. So that's localisation. Another example of localisation could be a website, and if we're going to go the whole hog, what we would look at is every element of your website, so that could be the use of icons, it could be colours, it would be dates, times, measurements, addresses, URLs... you name it. We just look at every single aspect to make sure that that website is going to work correctly in the country or culture it's being localised for. So, localisation, you can apply to absolutely anything. And the way you need to think about it is: how do I adapt, change, mould whatever I have that I'm taking into that different country, to make sure it works according to their culture, their language, their expectations, their legal system, etc. Translation is simply about translating the words and that would be part of the localisation process. If you have any more questions about localisation, and how it all works or what the differences are, please send us an email or give us a call, we'd be happy to explain it further.", "title": "What is Localization?

Injuries cause an inflammatory response that recruits leukocytes (white blood cells) to the site of injury. This process is referred to as extravasation. Leukocytes normally circulate freely within the blood vessel and help defend the body. They are recruited to a site of injury by cytokines (signaling molecules) that are secreted by the injured tissue. Leukocytes approach the inflammatory site where the cytokine concentration is the greatest. Another type of cytokines, more commonly known as chemokines, travel to nearby blood vessel endothelial cells and induce the blood vessel to express P- and E-selectins. These selectins exhibit low affinity, ephemeral interactions with their complementary leukocyte carbohydrate ligands, which allows leukocytes to tumble along the vessel wall in order to find a location to adhere. Binding of selectins induces a G-protein coupled second messenger system within the leukocyte. This second messenger system activates integrins, which are the ligands responsible for tight adhesion to the blood vessel wall. The activated integrins are able to bind ICAM molecules on the endothelial cells. These interactions are responsible for cell adhesion.\n\nNotes for Discrepancies:\n\n1) Chemokine Receptor fell off leukocyte\n2) GPCR/second messenger system is given as a broad general overview, and does not show all specific proteins involved\n3) We didn't differentiate all ligands by color.\n\n\nWork Cited\n1) Aplin, A.

For example, Korean juk porridge is what will be recommended if you have an upset or unsettled stomach; if you've you just had surgery or low on the libido factor eating dog meat is recommended; ginseng is the preferred root for those suffering from low energy.  Anyhow, it's not surprising that Haejangguk is a weapon of choice for Koreans who indulge a little too much with adult beverages.  After-all, Korea as a nation, is infamous for its high consumption rates of alcohol, particularly soju and beer.\n\nAlthough we're not big drinkers ourselves, nor were we hungover on this particular occasion, we certainly enjoy this soup that is often associated with those recovering from a little too much bubbly.\n  \nThe soup literally translates 'soup to chase a hangover' and consists of congealed ox blood, vegetables and cabbage in a thick broth.  What many may not realize is that there are various kinds of this soup including those with soy bean paste.\n\nOnce we tried a Korean hangover soup in my neighborhood that tasted awful; we couldn't even finish it.  However, the one in Audrey's neighborhood is one we both really enjoy and frequent often.\n\nIn this video, we show you how the meal is prepared, what ingredients are used and all of the accompanying side dishes. I pretend to be hungover (even though I'm not) but my lousy acting skills are likely very unconvincing ;)\n\nThus, if you're in Korea, make it a point to try Korean hangover soup if you've got a buzz - or even if you don't ;)\n\nhttp://nomadicsamuel.com/video-blog/korean-hangover-soup\n\n\uc774 \uc5ec\ud589 \ube44\ub514\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 (\uc624\ub4dc\ub9ac & \uc0ac\ubb34\uc5d8) \ud574\uc7a5\uad6d\uc73c\ub85c \ub85c\uceec\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc219\ucde8 \uc218\ud504\ub97c \uc804\ubb38\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\uad6d \uc2dd\ub2f9\uc744 \ubc29\ubb38 \ud574\uc7a5\uad6d & \u89e3 \u9172 \uad6d.\n\n\uac08\ub9dd \ub450\uaebc\uc6b4 \ud48d\uc131\ud55c \uc2a4\ud29c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc989\uc2dc \uadf8\ub140\uc758 \uc774\uc6c3\uc5d0\uc788\ub294 \uc624\ub4dc\ub9ac\uc758 \uc88b\uc544\ud558\ub294 \ub808\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub791 \uc911 \ud55c \uacf3\uc744 \ubc29\ubb38\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4 \uc2e4\ud604,\uc774 \uc7a5\uc18c\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc219\ucde8 \uc2a4\ud29c\ub85c \uc54c\uace0 \ub610\ud55c, \ud574\uc7a5\uad6d\uc758 \uac70\ub300\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \uc5ed\uc784\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ub2f9\uc2e0\uc774 \uc7a0\uc2dc \ub3d9\uc548 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0b4\uc558 \uacbd\uc6b0, \ud55c\uad6d\uc778 \ubaa8\ub450\uac00 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc74c\uc2dd\uacfc \ud611\ud68c\uc758 \uc885\ub958\uc640 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc758 \uac74\uac15\uc5d0 \uad00\ub828\ub41c\uc774 \uc624\ud788\ub824 \uba85\ubc31\ud558\uac8c\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \ud55c\uad6d JUK \uc8fd \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc774 \ud654\uac00 \ub098 \ubd88\uc548 \uc704\uc7a5\uc774\uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uad8c\uc7a5\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4, \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc740 \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc774 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc218\uc220\uc774\ub098 \uac1c\uace0\uae30\ub97c \uba39\ub294 \uc131\uc695 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub0ae\uc740 \uac83\uc744 \uad8c\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4, \uc778\uc0bc \ub0ae\uc740\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \uace0\ud1b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \ub8e8\ud2b8 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0. \uc5ec\ud558\ud2bc, \uadf8\uac83\uc740 \ud574\uc7a5\uad6d \uc131\uc778 \uc74c\ub8cc\uc640 \ub108\ubb34 \uc870\uae08 \ube60\uc9c0\ub2e4 \ud55c\uad6d\uc778\uc744\uc704\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \ubb34\uae30 \uac83\uc740 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc77c\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4.\uad6d\uac00\ub85c - \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud6c4, \ud55c\uad6d\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc18c\ube44, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc54c\ucf54\uc62c\uc758 \ube44\uc728, \uc18c\uc8fc\uc640 \ub9e5\uc8fc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc545\uba85 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\nhttp://nomadicsamuel.com :  Haejangguk refers to all kinds of guk (soup) eaten as a hangover cure in Korean cuisine. It means \"soup to chase a hangover\"[1] and also called sulguk (\uc220\uad6d) in pure Korean.[2][3] It usually consists of dried Napa cabbage, congealed ox blood (similar to blood pudding), and vegetables in a hearty beef broth.\nIn the Nogeoldae, a manual for learning spoken Chinese published in the late Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), the term seongjutang (\u9192\u9152\u6e6f) appears. It means \"soup to get sober\" and is assumed to be the origin of haejangguk. According to the record, the soup consists of thinly sliced meat, noodles, scallions, and powder of cheoncho (\ucc9c\ucd08, fruit skins of Zanthoxylum piperitum) in a broth. \n\nThere are various types of haejangguk according to region based on ingredients and recipe that give each variety its own characteristic taste. Haejangguk of the Seoul region is a kind of tojangguk (soybean paste soup) made with kongnamul, daikon, napa cabbage, scallions, coagulated ox blood, and tojang in a broth. The broth is prepared by simmering ox bones in a pot with water for hours. The neighborhood of Cheongjin-dong is famous for the Seoul style haejangguk:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haejangguk\n\nProudly presented by:  http://smilingfacestravelphotos.com , http://thatbackpacker.com , http://nomadicsamuel.com/top100travelblogs , http://backpacking-travel-blog.com\n\nThis video features the song ''XXXXXXXXXXXXX\" available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Commercial license.", "title": "Eating Korean Hangover Soup (Haejangguk : \ud574\uc7a5\uad6d & \u89e3\u9172\uad6d) at a restaurant in Yongin, Korea", "publishedDate": "2012-08-26T05:59:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9wo0PjqkxSs", "description": "How to make Honey-Lemon-Ginger tea from scratch.

Thompson\nScreenwriter: Peter Morgan, Philippa Gregory\nFilm Description: Adapted from author Philippa Gregory's historical novel of the same name, director Justin Chadwick's atmospheric period drama follows the fierce competition between sisters Mary (Scarlett Johansson) and Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) to win the affections of Tudor king Henry VIII (Eric Bana). Anne and Mary Boleyn are under pressure from their father and uncle to help maintain the family's rich legacy and ensure their further prosperity by winning the affections of none other than the king of England (Eric Bana). But life in the royal court is far different than it was in the countryside where these two sisters were raised, and before long their bid to earn the love of the king has transformed two once-happy sisters into bitter rivals. At first, it appears that Mary has triumphed in winning the king's favor by becoming his mistress and bearing him an illegitimate child. Despite her early success, however, Mary has underestimated just how clever and cunning her sibling can truly be. Not only does the relentless Anne manage to edge aside her sister in the eyes of King Henry, but she also succeeds in averting his gaze from his wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon, as well. Mary is driven by genuine affection for King Henry, while her sister Anne has only kept up the charade in a desperate bid to become the queen of England. Now, the growing chasm between two sisters is mirrored on a larger scale as England becomes divided more than ever before. As the consequences of their actions threaten to alter the course of an entire nation, these two sisters will ultimately discover that the only place they will find true strength and loyalty is in family, and that no matter what the consequences they will forever be bound by blood.\n\n\"the other boleyn girl\",\"the other boleyn girl clip\",\"natalie portman\",\"eric bana\",\"david morrissey\",\"mark rylance\",\"justin chadwick\",\"romantic dramas\",drama,\"dramas based on bestsellers\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"period pieces\",\"united kingdom\",\"scott rudin\",\"david m thompson\",\"attraction videos\",\"listening videos\",\"manipulation videos\",\"power videos\",\"wisdom videos\",\"castle videos\",\"anne boleyn\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++353424,/m/09l3p,/m/018009,/m/06xh_m,/m/02_53p", "title": "The Other Boleyn Girl (4/11) Movie CLIP - Looking for a Great Man (2008) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T14:50:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "9wrBROwoRSk", "description": "This model proposes that the production of somites during embryogenesis results from a molecular oscillator (called the clock) traveling along the embryonic axis.

Lohan brought the topic up after one of her interviewers asked her what it had been like to watch herself on the show. Lindsay: When the camera's on, I'm on. And if I know I'm not capable of being on, that's why I would say that I couldn't film today. And no one knows this, and we can finish after this, I had a miscarriage for those two weeks that I took off. It was a very long story.\n\nProducer: I'm so sorry.\n\nLindsay: That's why on the show when it says, \"She doesn't want to come down, she doesn't want to come down,\" I couldn't move. I was sick.\n\nProducer: I'm so sorry.\n\nLindsay: And mentally, that messes with you. And watching this series, I just know how I felt at that moment, and I can relate to that girl, which sounds kind of crazy, but I'm like, \"Oh my god, this is really sad. Like, who's helping her?\" And no one knows what's going on in my head at every second because I'm constantly thinking. Like my mind does not shut off. Which, the only time it does is when I start doing meditation or I put music on in my headphones, there was a lot going on in my life then.\nLohan did not say who the father is.

He graduated in arts and law with distinction from the Punjab University. He was awarded PhD by the Punjab University in 1986 on the thesis Punishments in Islam, their classification and philosophy. He took allegiance at the hand of Sayyidina Tahir Ala-ud-Din al-Qadri al-Gilani who groomed him in the mystic way of life and who is his spiritual benefactor. Among his teachers are included his father Dr Farid-ul-Din Qadri, Mawlana Zia-ud-Din Madani, Mawlana Ahmad Saeed Kazmi, Dr Burhan Ahmad Farooqi, Dr Muhammad bin Alawi, all men of high intellectual calibre and scholarly stature. He has delivered thousands of lectures spanning diverse facets of Islam, its religious, spiritual, historical, moral, legal, political, economic, social and scientific aspects and its comparison with other religions. He also delivers lectures at foreign universities on various intellectual and contemporary issues. He has written numerous books in Urdu, English and Arabic to date. Many of his books have been translated into different languages. His lectures are also broadcast from different TV channels in the Western and Arabian world.\n\nMinhaj-ul-Quran International launched by him is thriving now in more than 80 countries of the world. He also laid the foundation of mass education programme (MEP) in Pakistan, which is the greatest educational plan at the unofficial level. His political party, Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), is playing a vital role in national politics by promoting the tradition of tolerance, principle observance and progressiveness in national political culture. He is a unifying symbol of Muslim world and known as an ambassador of peace and human welfare. His intellectual and social contributions to human progress are internationally acknowledged. American Biographical Institute has pronounced him outstanding man of the 20th century and his name has been included in the Millennium Biographical Dictionary as a distinguished intellectual and thinker of the world. Moreover, he is also included among the 500 most effective leaders at the end of the second millennium as recognition of his original research and services to humanity. He was declared 1998-99 personality by the International Biographical Centre, Cambridge as an acknowledgement of his educational and social contributions. In the recent past it is hard to find an individual who has rendered such unprecedented services in such a short span of time for the improvement of the Islamic community through his intellectual and practical struggle.\n\nDr Qadri is, therefore, not an individual but a tradition. He is not only a sensitive interpreter of Islamic values but also a harbinger of the resplendent future of Islam.", "title": "Happy Birthday to Shaykh ul Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir ul Qadri", "publishedDate": "2009-02-14T13:47:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9wsHDTSu3JU", "description": "", "title": "After Effects Animated Number Count", "publishedDate": "2013-04-18T00:21:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "9wt8pbx_nm4", "description": "Discrimination et sexisme dans le milieu du travail sont deux choses encore trop pr\u00e9sentes dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9...", "title": "Les deux minutes du peuple - sexisme au travail", "publishedDate": "2008-07-12T17:33:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "9wtMfuNz0ls", "description": "Chuck Ragan performs Bleeder live at The Grist Mill in Waterloo Ontario.

In more recent years, they have become a common remedy for fibrosis conditions, including excessive scar tissue from injuries and uterine fibroids. \n\nAs technologies have advanced over the past years, more powerful enzymes have been added to systemic enzyme formulas to increase the inflammation and fibrosis benefits. In addition, enzyme manufacturers have begun using pharmaceutical technologies to ensure maximum systemic enzyme absorption. This practice has created much debate among enzyme manufacturers as to the necessity of these enteric coatings. Are they necessary?\n\nIn our opinion...it all depends on the blend. If a systemic enzyme formula is significantly dependent upon animal derived enzymes (pancreatin, trypsin, chymotrypsin), we believe the enzyme must be protected from the stomach acids. However in the case of vegetarian focused enzyme blends, such as those containing serrapeptase, we believe the necessity of enzyme protection is dependent upon dosing instructions and enzyme activity levels.\n\nhttp://www.takebackyourhealth.com/blog/\nhttp://www.takebackyourhealth.com/articles.html", "title": "Systemic Enzymes -- Is Enteric Coating Required?", "publishedDate": "2011-07-22T09:09:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "9wwAeh4UuqY", "description": "I was using the elevator and I got through the top. then i was in that special area which look like mario a lot.

Instead, Turkish authorities have been battling desperate Kurdish refugees trapped between ISIS and the border.\n\nThe embattled Kurds are also angry that U.S. air power has been used sparingly in recent days as ISIS pushed its way into Kobani. There were a handful of sorties on Monday and the U.S. military said that today's strikes around Kobani destroyed five ISIS armed vehicles, a tank and ISIS unit of fighters.\n\nU.S. and partner nations reportedly fired five air strikes over the course of Monday and today that were specifically targeting ISIS tanks and artillery. CENTCOM released a statement this morning saying that they used \"attack, bomber, fighter and remotely piloted aircraft\" to strike the targets in the areas surrounding Kobani.\n\nThough the strikes were targeting ISIS anti-aircraft artillery and tanks that were likely headed towards Kobani, there are no reports of clear action being taken against the ISIS fighters who are fighting in Kobani.\n\nKurdish protesters in Cyprus are demanding further action by Turkey and other European nations to help defend Kobani. The Associated Press reports that such protests were also taking place at the European Parliament in Brussels where one group of demonstrators forced themselves into the building past police.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Berlin and Frankfurt where there are large Kurdish populations as well as in the Netherlands and Austria", "title": "Air Strikes Near Kobani Not Stopping ISIS Takeover of Syrian Town", "publishedDate": "2014-10-07T16:25:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "9wz0KitxtDQ", "description": "Great magazine skit from 1x03 of the Peter Serafinowicz Show.", "title": "Peter Serafinowicz Show: Gravies of the Ancients", "publishedDate": "2008-07-04T20:20:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9wzIbZ0vQS4", "description": "O que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 comendo no caf\u00e9 da manh\u00e3 est\u00e1 mais para sobremesa do que para cereal?

Push off the wall in a streamlined position, and begin to glide under the water about 6 to 8 inches under the water, and begin to do the breaststroke arms with the breaststroke kick, without coming up for a breath. This will help you stay underwater for a certain period of time without needing to come up for a breath. If you would like to have a great swim underwater, it's suggested that you exhale a little bit so your body can stay underwater while you move your arms and your legs to push yourself through the water. The arms are kind of down like the butterfly. \n\nYou push all the way down with your arms to your hips, kick with your legs, and then recover your arms by bringing them as close as possible to your body, and reach forward to begin the repetition again. Push down, bring your arms down all the way to your hips, and come up with your arms forward. If you begin to run out of air, come up to the surface, take a breath, and then dive down again and repeat the butterfly arms with the breaststroke kick in that repetition.

These included some wave clouds and small lenticular clouds.   We also had some low, locally formed clouds showing iridescence at the same time.  All but one of the pictures is of the high streaming clouds.  Occasionally, a partial corona was visible, but the iridescent features were mostly scattered fragments various distances not far from the sun.\n\nThe colors were easily visible to the naked eye when the sun was blocked, but polarized glasses definitely enhanced the viewing.

These particular experiments were conducted during March 1958, and were conducted to determine the characteristics of an aircraft mounted Zinc Cadmium sulphide dispenser. The resulting information was then used in Porton Down's later public area BW experiments, some of which (the Large Area Coverage or LAC) contaminated vast swathes of the UK. A BW simulant is a supposedly harmless substance which mimics the physical properties of a real BW agent, in this case, size (between 1-5 microns). BW simulants are used in BW experiments in which, for safety reasons, a real BW agent could not be used.\n\nA similar procedure was adopted for the 1963/64 Norwich Trials. An aircraft, this time a Devon, sprayed the BW simulant Zinc Cadmium sulphide, at a rate of 2-3 lbs per mile, as it flew along a 62 nm track across Norfolk - at a distance of 24 miles upwind of the city of Norwich. When the massive aerosol cloud reached its target area, Porton Down scientists conducted clandestine sampling of the air at a large number of locations, across the city and surrounding countryside.\n\nhttp://www.nr23.net/govt/spray.htm\nhttp://www.nr23.net/govt/spray_dorset.htm\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2002/apr/21/uk.medicalscience\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/4507036.stm\nhttp://www.democracynow.org/2004/5/5/plutonium_files_how_the_u_s\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2468682221252589852#", "title": "Rare declassified Valetta Aircraft Spraying The Biological Warfare Simulant - Zinc Cadmium sulphide", "publishedDate": "2010-12-03T17:47:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "9xPSqiMXVpY", "description": "Larry Page ha sido elegido empresario del a\u00f1o por la revista Fortune en su ranking anual por \"haber demostrado ser el CEO m\u00e1s audaz del mundo\".

They have a black crown and back with the remainder of the body white or grey, red eyes, and short yellow legs. They have pale grey wings and white under parts. Two or three long white plumes, erected in greeting and courtship displays, extend from the back of the head. The sexes are similar in appearance although the males are slightly larger. Black-crowned Night Herons do not fit the typical body form of the heron family. They are relatively stocky with shorter bills, legs, and necks than their more familiar cousins, the egrets and \"day\" herons. Their resting posture is normally somewhat hunched but when hunting they extend their necks and look more like other wading birds.\n\nImmature birds have dull grey-brown plumage on their heads, wings, and backs, with numerous pale spots. Their underparts are paler and streaked with brown. The young birds have orange eyes and duller yellowish-green legs. They are very noisy birds in their nesting colonies, with calls that are commonly transcribed as quok or woc, woc.\n\nSource:Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Henryk Wars -- Nie P\u0142acz (Don't Cry) Tango (J.Front, S.Ferszko -- Jerry) Syrena-Electro 1935 (Polish)\n\nNOTE: On 28th June 1945, govenrments of USA and Great Britain declared legality of the Soviet-Polish communist \u201egovernment\", which had been installed in Poland after the end of military actions of the Second World War - as result of the Allied Forces' betrayal of Poland in Yalta, in  February 1945. \nLet us remember, that during the Second World War, Poland despite of German and Soviet devastating occupations od all of its prewar territory, was  still able to emit, from its decimated human resources, the emigree Polish Army counting 200 000 soldiers. Guided by general W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders, Polish Army became the most devoted ally of Western Alllied Forces. Nobody should ever forget the role of Polish fighters during the air-battle of Great Britain in 1940, Polish contribution to the the heroic fights in the Northern Africa, struggle of Polish soldiers -- and  enormous tribute of their blood -- in battle for the hill of  Monte Cassino in Italy, as well as their role in liberation of France, Belgium or Netherlands. \n \nIn spite of that, in July 1945 Polish soldiers - who in great number were pre-war citizens of  Lw\u00f3w, Wilno or other towns and villages, located in the eastern part of Poland - could not believe their ears hearing, their homeland with their homes, families, churches - had been donated by Roosevelt and Churchill to Stalin, as \"territory of the Soviet influence\". This meant  nothing but unprecedented betrayal of Poland by its western friends - and laying the fate of Poland into hands of the bolshevik mass murderer, Josef Stalin. Someone, whose role in the assasination of 20, 000 Polish war captives in the woods of Katy\u0144 in April, 1940 must have had been well known to all the participants of the Yalta Pact. \n\nTherefore, I dedicate this beautiful song to the memory of  200 000 citizens of Lw\u00f3w -- of one of the most beautiful cities in pre-war Poland (Warsaw, Cracow, Wilno, Lw\u00f3w), which, before September 1939, was inhabited in 85 percent by the Poles. The monuments of Lw\u00f3w - the gothic, the renaissance, the baroque churches or palaces of Polish nobility, as well as the Magdeburg-law based urban plan of the city -- something totally alien for the location rules of Ukrainian or Russian towns -- as well as still very much \"western\" air of Lw\u00f3w -- still tells about Polish identity of that town and a Polish heart, which in spite of many decades of Russification and also, Ukrainisation is still beating silently, somewhere deep beneath the roots of Lw\u00f3w. \n\nThis record is a flip side of  http://youtu.be/rSVSYIoc2xo", "title": "Mieczys\u0142aw Fogg sings Polish Tango - Nie p\u0142acz (Don't Cry) 1935", "publishedDate": "2012-07-19T20:38:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9xfitzDfcAA", "description": "110th upload!

But death comes to kidnap the superior part of our double hero, and lets the other one drop down towards the earth.

Inside the museum, the paintings and the sculpture (there is only one  Michelangelos David) our hero/heroine meets on his way come to life and threaten him/her.\nWhat if the destiny, not only of art, but of all of Western culture, had been decided between 726 and 787 A.D., i.e., between the destruction of sacred images ordered by the Byzantine Emperor Leo III Isaurico and the following council of Nicea, which, on the contrary, declared the lawfulness of their cult?\nImages continue to have a central role  even after the decline of the Christian religion as a crucial means of social cohesion  in the secularised and disenchanted society which has formed in the course of modernity. The victory of iconolatry between the VIII and IX Century of the vulgar era, in other words, could have marked the West in an irreversible way.\nThe only way to really come to terms with the art of our past is by freeing it from the ideological and habitual incrustations, which have transformed some masterpieces into common places of a diffuse and banal culture.\nConcept and Design: Lorenzo Pizzanelli\nDirectors: Fariba Ferdosi and Lorenzo Pizzanelli", "title": "ICONOCLAST GAME trailer", "publishedDate": "2009-07-23T00:27:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9xoqxXX3bQ0", "description": "A trip along the Rhine's romantic and picturesque valley reveals Napoleon's chain cutting and radios that scream out emergencies like an electrified baby bird.

It has an area of about 23,000 square kilometres (8,900 sq mi) and a population of about 3.7 million inhabitants. The regional capital is Florence.\n\nTuscany is known for its beautiful landscapes, its rich artistic legacy and vast influence on high culture. Tuscany is widely regarded as the true birthplace of the Italian Renaissance, and has been home to some of the most influential people in the history of arts and science, such as Petrarch, Dante, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo Galilei, Amerigo Vespucci, Luca Pacioli and Puccini. Due to this, the region has several museums (such as the Uffizi, the Pitti Palace and the Chianciano Museum of Art). Tuscany has a unique culinary tradition, and is famous for its wines (most famous of which are Chianti, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, Morellino di Scansano and Brunello di Montalcino).\n\nSix Tuscan localities have been designated World Heritage Sites: the historic centre of Florence (1982), the historical centre of Siena (1995), the square of the Cathedral of Pisa (1987), the historical centre of San Gimignano (1990), the historical centre of Pienza (1996) and the Val d'Orcia (2004). Furthermore, Tuscany has over 120 protected nature reserves. This makes Tuscany and its capital city Florence very popular tourist destinations, attracting millions of tourists every year. Florence itself receives an average of 10 million tourists a year by placing the city as one of the most visited in the world (in 2007, the city became the world's 46th most visited city, with over 1.715 million arrivals).

The ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the Anatidae family; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species) but a form taxon, since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.  Hilarious ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules, and coots.  The overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad, and the bird ducks are also relatively long-necked, albeit not as long-necked as the geese and swans. The body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in being more rounded. The adorable bill is usually broad and contains serrated lamellae, which are particularly well defined in the filter-feeding species. In the case of some fishing species the sweet bill is long and strongly serrated. The scaled legs are strong and well developed, and generally set far back on the body, more so in the highly aquatic species. The wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed, and the flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes, requiring in turn strong wing muscles. Three species of steamer duck are almost flightless, however. Many species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting; they seek out protected habitat with good food supplies during this period. This moult typically precedes migration. The drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage, but that is moulted in summer to give a more female-like appearance, the \"eclipse\" plumage. Southern resident species typically show less sexual dimorphism, although there are exceptions like the Paradise Shelduck of New Zealand which is both strikingly sexually dimorphic and where the female's plumage is brighter than that of the male. The plumage of juvenile birds generally resembles that of the female duckling.  Sexy ducks exploit a variety of food sources such as grasses, aquatic plants, fish, insects, small amphibians, worms, and small molluscs. Diving ducklings and sea ducks forage deep underwater. To be able to submerge more easily, the diving ducks are heavier than dabbling ducks, and therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly. Dabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land, or as deep as they can reach by up-ending without completely submerging. Along the edge of the beak there is a comb-like structure called a pecten. This strains the water squirting from the side of the beak and traps any food. The pecten is also used to preen feathers and to hold slippery food items. A few specialized species such as the mergansers are adapted to catch and swallow large funny fish. The others have the characteristic wide flat beak adapted to dredging-type jobs such as pulling up waterweed, pulling worms and small molluscs out of mud, searching for insect larvae, and bulk jobs such as dredging out, holding, turning headfirst, and swallowing a squirming frog kitten kitty kitties kittens cute cuter cat cats feline felines adorable lovely love pet pets animal animals sweet nice catnip purr purrs purring milk pregnant pregnancy pregnancies puss pussy kittycat kittycats kit pussycat tail tails feed feeding milking mice hunt hunting play playing toy toys whisker whiskers cutest hair hairy fur furry catch playing pussycats litter litters outdoors outdoors urine meal meals scat litter box litter boxes things good bad weird strange odd fast calico calicos  To avoid injury when digging into sediment it has no cere, but the nostrils come out through hard horn.  The ducks are generally monogamous, although these bonds generally last a single year only. Larger species and the more sedentary species (like fast river specialists) tend to have pair-bonds that last numerous years. Most cute duck species breed once a year, choosing to do so in favourable conditions (spring/summer or wet seasons). Ducks also tend to make a nest before breeding. Although mother ducks are very caring and protective of their young, they are not above abandoning some of their ducklings if they are physically stuck in an area they cannot get out of or are not prospering due to genetic defects or sickness brought about by hypothermia, starvation, or disease. Ducklings can also be orphaned by inconsistent, late hatching where a few eggs hatch long after the mother has abandoned the nest. A common urban legend claims that duck quacks do not echo; however, this has been shown to be false. This myth was first debunked by the Acoustics Research Centre at the University of Salford in 2003 as part of the British Association's Festival of Science. It was also debunked in one of the earlier episodes of the popular Discovery Channel television show MythBusters", "title": "Newly Hatched Duckling Looks Ugly To Me But People Think Its Cute", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T21:57:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "9y2fsZPddqs", "description": "My first ever coyote and i got it in a PA legal cable restraint. no entanglements and i got him!! the cable was there for about 2 weeks before i got him", "title": "PA cable restraint Coyote", "publishedDate": "2014-01-08T16:22:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9y2y-Tkn7eg", "description": "Chinatown Movie Clip - watch all clips http://j.mp/xZI70L\nclick to subscribe http://j.mp/sNDUs5\n\nJake (Jack Nicholson) is caught snooping at the reservoir by Mulvihill (Roy Jenson) and his blade-wielding henchman (Roman Polanski).\n\nTM & \u00a9 Paramount (2012)\nCast: Roy Jenson, Jack Nicholson, Roman Polanski\nDirector: Roman Polanski\nMOVIECLIPS YouTube Channel: http://j.mp/vqieFG\nJoin our Facebook page: http://j.mp/tb8OMH\nFollow us on Twitter: http://j.mp/rZzGsm\nBuy Movie: http://amzn.to/upfytN\nProducer: C.O. Erickson, Robert Evans\nScreenwriter: Roman Polanski, Robert Towne\nFilm Description: \"You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't,\" warns water baron Noah Cross (John Huston), when smooth cop-turned-private eye J.J. \"Jake\" Gittes (Jack Nicholson) starts nosing around Cross's water diversion scheme. That proves to be the ominous lesson of Chinatown, Roman Polanski's critically lauded 1974 revision of 1940s film noir detective movies. In 1930s Los Angeles, \"matrimonial work\" specialist Gittes is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to tail her husband, Water Department engineer Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling). Gittes photographs him in the company of a young blonde and figures the case is closed, only to discover that the real Mrs. Mulwray had nothing to do with hiring Gittes in the first place. When Hollis turns up dead, Gittes decides to investigate further, encountering a shady old-age home, corrupt bureaucrats, angry orange farmers, and a nostril-slicing thug (Polanski) along the way. By the time he confronts Cross, Evelyn's father and Mulwray's former business partner, Jake thinks he knows everything, but an even more sordid truth awaits him. When circumstances force Jake to return to his old beat in Chinatown, he realizes just how impotent he is against the wealthy, depraved Cross. \"Forget it, Jake,\" his old partner tells him. \"It's Chinatown.\" Reworking the somber underpinnings of detective noir along more pessimistic lines, Polanski and screenwriter Robert Towne convey a '70s-inflected critique of capitalist and bureaucratic malevolence in a carefully detailed period piece harkening back to the genre's roots in the 1930s and '40s. Gittes always has a smart comeback like Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, but the corruption Gittes finds is too deep for one man to stop. Other noir revisions, such as Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye (1973) and Arthur Penn's Night Moves (1975), also centered on the detective's inefficacy in an uncertain '70s world, but Chinatown's period sheen renders this dilemma at once contemporary and timeless, pointing to larger implications about the effects of corporate rapaciousness on individuals. Polanski and Towne clashed over Chinatown's ending; Polanski won the fight, but Towne won the Oscar for Best Screenplay. Chinatown was nominated for ten other Oscars, including Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes, and Score.\n\nchinatown,\"chinatown clip\",\"chinatown full movie\",\"chinatown destroyer\",\"chinatown part 1\",\"chinatown theme\",\"chinatown wild nothing\",\"jack nicholson\",\"roy jenson\",\"roman polanski\",\"knife videos\",\"classic dramas\",\"classic thrillers\",\"20th century period pieces\",classics,\"crime dramas\",\"film noir\",mystery,\"period pieces\",\"co erickson\",\"robert evans\",\"violence videos\",\"jj gittes\",\"man with knife\",mulvihill,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9362,/m/07x51l,/m/09fb5,/m/06b_0", "title": "Nosy Fella - Chinatown (5/9) Movie CLIP (1974) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-10T23:06:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9y3sq5hRtHA", "description": "Euskadi con mucho gusto", "title": "Euskadi con mucho gusto", "publishedDate": "2007-04-26T10:37:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "9y496qKlfz8", "description": "DISCUSS ON REDDIT: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1zv1ha/just_my_2_cents_on_streamerspros_getting_bashed/\nBISH WHET?: https://twitter.com/__romiti\nTWITTER!!: http://twitter.com/gregskywilliams\nTUMBLR!!: http://gregskywilliams.tumblr.com/\nFACEBOOK!: http://facebook.com/gregskywilliams\nSTREAM!: http://twitch.tv/sky_mp3\nEMAIL/BEAR APPLICATION!!: Gregidot@gmail.com\nDONATE! =D :http://tinyurl.com/ms8b7f5", "title": "The 'Problem (I guess?)' with the League Community but only kinda.", "publishedDate": "2014-03-08T02:19:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "9y4VwllCTBY", "description": "more\nwww.fuglekiggeren.dk", "title": "Puffin (Fratercula arctica) Lunde1", "publishedDate": "2008-06-25T21:11:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9y4XzIv_USw", "description": "Cornus mas\n(Corvinus besz\u00e1mol\u00f3)", "title": "Cornus mas", "publishedDate": "2008-10-09T04:27:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "9y4bEmCT7ok", "description": "Fam\u00edlia Theraphosidae, Aranha caranguejeira em Campo Grande-MS\n\nEsp\u00e9cie Acanthoscurria atrox.", "title": "Aranha caranguejeira - Acanthoscurria Atrox (3)", "publishedDate": "2007-11-12T17:13:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "9y4cF7-lKu8", "description": "Gastrointestinal hemorrhage can be a manifestation of an aortoenteric fistula from erosion of the gastrointestinal tract by an adjacent vascular prosthesis.

Paul said the film is based on a Malaysian journalist's theory of what transpired in the early morning of March 8 after the plane left Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing. It was short in Mumbai, India, for more than six days.\n\nThe movie, which has a budget of $3.5 million, has yet to be short. Filming is expected to be done in the US and India in 30 days with over 200 actors, while the worldwide release is scheduled in September where Paul's erotic movie is currently being screened outside the Cannes competition.\n\nSome people who viewed the trailer reacted negatively to the film in the comments section of YouTube.\n\nToryadoBull wrote, \"The plane has yet to be found and these people are already trying to make money out of it. Ruthless. I wouldn't pay a cent to watch it.\n\nBut Lovely Meloman replied that people don't make movies for the viewers to be happy, but to make money. He pointed out that catastrophe movies make a lot of money.\n\nOgWire believes the movie will be made to divert the public's attention from what really happened, although more details have yet to be bared.\n\nWeeks after the tragic air mishap, the producers of the Australian film Deep Water was shelved because of the similarity of its plot to MH370, about a jet that crashes into the ocean while en route to China.\n\nMeanwhile, a book about the incident is also slated to be on bookstores beginning on Monday.

Pueden ser tan peque\u00f1os como granos de arenilla o, en ocasiones excepcionales, tan grandes que ocupan toda la ves\u00edcula. La mayor parte, sin embargo, suelen ser de tama\u00f1o intermedio, es decir de menos de 20 mm, aproximadamente una pulgada.\nHay dos clases principales de c\u00e1lculos biliares:\nLos de colesterol, compuestos en su mayor parte por esa sustancia, que representan alrededor del 80% de todos los casos diagnosticados en los Estados Unidos. \nLos pigmentarios, constituidos en su mayor parte por sales c\u00e1lcicas de pigmentos biliares y otros compuestos, a los que corresponde el 20% restante de los casos diagnosticados. \nPuesto que la mayor\u00eda de los pacientes tienen c\u00e1lculos de colesterol, es posible tratarlos sin recurrir a intervenci\u00f3n quir\u00fargica. La clase de c\u00e1lculo es importante, ya que s\u00f3lo los c\u00e1lculos de colesterol pueden tratarse por m\u00e9todos no quir\u00fargicos.\nSon muchas las personas que, teniendo c\u00e1lculos biliares, carecen de s\u00edntomas. Cuando los s\u00edntomas se hacen evidentes, la persona portadora de c\u00e1lculos biliares puede experimentar:\nDolor fuerte y seguido en el abdomen superior; este dolor puede propagarse al t\u00f3rax, hombros y espalda y se confunde a veces con los s\u00edntoma de un ataque al coraz\u00f3n. \nIndigesti\u00f3n, n\u00e1useas o v\u00f3mito. \ncolangitis \npancreatitis \nfistulas \nperforacion \nDolor intenso de abdomen y sensibilidad al tacto en el lado derecho del abdomen cuando la ves\u00edcula biliar est\u00e1 inflamada. \nIctericia, escalofr\u00edos y fiebre cuando los c\u00e1lculos biliares impiden el paso de la bilis. \nSe observa que cuando el liquido queda obstruido puede haber un ataque de dolor. Este dolor en el abdomen, va en aumento, durando de una media hora hasta varias horas.\nIn medicine, gallstones (choleliths) are crystalline bodies formed within the body by accretion or concretion of normal or abnormal bile components.\nGallstones can occur anywhere within the biliary tree, including the gallbladder and the common bile duct. Obstruction of the common bile duct is choledocholithiasis; obstruction of the biliary tree can cause jaundice; obstruction of the outlet of the pancreatic exocrine system can cause pancreatitis. Cholelithiasis is the presence of stones in the gallbladder or bile ducts: chole- means \"bile\", lithia means \"stone\", and -sis means \"process\".\nGallstones usually remain asymptomatic initially. They start developing symptoms once the stones reach a certain size (more than 8 mm).A main symptom of gallstones is commonly referred to as a gallstone \"attack\", also known as biliary colic, in which a person will experience intense pain in the upper abdominal region that steadily increases for approximately thirty minutes to several hours. A patient may also experience pain in the back, ordinarily between the shoulder blades, or pain under the right shoulder. In some cases, the pain develops in the lower region of the abdomen, nearer to the pelvis, but this is less common. Nausea and vomiting may occur. Patients characteristically exhibit a positive Murphy's sign: the patient is instructed to breathe in while the gall bladder is deeply palpated. If the gallbladder is inflamed, the patient will abruptly stop inhaling due to the pain, a positive Murphy's sign.\nThese attacks are sharp and intensely painful, similar to that of a kidney stone attack. Often, attacks occur after a particularly fatty meal and almost always happen at night. Other symptoms include abdominal bloating, intolerance of fatty foods, belching, gas, and indigestion. The patient should also make sure to drink an appropriate amount of water relative to the number of calories being taken in. If the above symptoms coincide with chills, low-grade fever, yellowing of the skin or eyes, and/or clay-colored stool, a doctor should be consulted immediately.\nSome people who have gallstones are asymptomatic and do not feel any pain or discomfort. These gallstones are called \"silent stones\" and do not affect the gallbladder or other internal organs. They do not need treatment.", "title": "C\u00e1lculos en la ves\u00edcula biliar (colelitiasis) - Cholelithiasis", "publishedDate": "2010-07-17T02:11:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "9yEy1zPEhyc", "description": "In Irish Cinemas June 27th.

Now you are going to hear just how many they are. If Dominic were to come down from the place of delights where he has true happiness and were to cry out as follows: 'My dear brothers, you my followers, there are four good things in reserve for you: honor in return for humility, everlasting riches in return for poverty, satisfaction without boredom in return for continence, eternal life in return for the contempt of the world,' they would scarcely listen to him. On the contrary, if the devil suddenly came up from his hollow and proclaimed four different things, and said: 'Dominic promised you four things. Look here, I have what you want in my hand.\n\nI offer honors, I hold wealth in my hand, instant gratification is there, the world will be delicious to enjoy. Take what I offer you, then! Use these things that are certain! Lead a life of joy so that after death you may rejoice together!' If these two voices were now to sound in the world, more people would run to the voice of the robber and devil than to the voice of Dominic, my great good friend. What shall I say of the friars of Dominic?\nThose who are in his rule are indeed few, fewer still those who follow in his footsteps by imitating him. For not everyone listens to the one voice, because not everyone is of one and the same sort - not in the sense that not everyone comes from God or that not everyone can be saved, if they want, but in the sense that not everyone listens to the voice of the Son of God saying: 'Come to me and I will refresh you, by giving you myself!'", "title": "TOXICOLOGY !!!

The manga serial began in the June 1996 issue of Ciao and the anime was first broadcast in 1997. A movie, \"Adolescence of Utena\" (\u5c11\u5973 \u9769\u547d \u30a6\u30c6\u30ca\uff5e\u30a2\u30c9\u30a5\u30ec\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\u9ed9\u793a\u9332, Adolescence Mokushiroku?, literally \"Adolescence Apocalypse\") was released in theatres in 1999. A number of stage productions based on the franchise were also produced in the mid 1990s, including the \"Comedie Musicale Utena la fillette r\u00e9volutionnaire\", staged by an all-female Takarazuka-style cast.\n\nThe main character is Utena Tenjou, a tomboyish teenage girl who was so impressed by a kind prince in her childhood that she decided to become a prince herself (expressed in her manner of dress and personality). She attends Ohtori Academy, where she meets a student named Anthy Himemiya, a girl who is in an abusive relationship with another student. Utena fights to protect Anthy and is pulled into a series of sword duels with the members of the Student Council. Anthy is referred to as the \"Rose Bride\" and is given to the winner of each duel. As Anthy is thought to be the key to a coming revolution, the current champion is constantly challenged for the right to possess the Rose Bride.\n\nWhile the show generally has the appearance of a magical girl series, it is also highly metaphysical and allegorical. It contains a mix of borrowed visuals from Takarazuka theater, shadow puppetry, and classic Sh\u014djo.\n\nThe anime and manga were created simultaneously, but, despite some similarities, they progressed in different directions.\n\nSource:wikipdia.org", "title": "Utena OST1 - Shi no Aphrodite", "publishedDate": "2008-04-15T20:39:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9yOzwHoSxcg", "description": "The Viaduct is the longest rail trestle in the U.S. and 3rd in the world.

So if you count time the game is a 5D game. It is a correct representation of a fourth spatial dimension.\n\n* Yeah it's actually \"around\" walls, not \"through!\"\n\n* There are *infinitely* many 3D worlds stacked on top of each other, even if in the introductory Wall Level the ground texture makes it seem like there are only two. A more complex example is the shape at the beginning of the trailer, which is a true 4D shape called the 120 Cell, as explained here: http://marctenbosch.com/news/2014/04/what-is-that-shape-at-the-end-of-the-trailer-hd-screenshot/\n\n* From the perspective of a regular 3D observer standing next to the wall the player character would suddenly disappear, and a few moments later reappear on the other side of the wall.\n\n* See also: Flatland (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland)\n\n* We will make more videos explaining things about the fourth dimension using the game.
