But several days later, the man developed a rash over his armpits, groin and buttocks \u2014 an unusual condition known as \"baboon syndrome.\"\n\nThe condition, more formally called symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), is known as baboon syndrome because the rash on the patient's buttocks resembles the red hindquarters of some monkeys.\n\nBecause doctors often prescribe penicillin antibiotics to treat tonsillitis and other bacterial infections, it is important to be aware that baboon syndrome is one of the medication's possible side effects, wrote the researchers who reported the man's case online Nov. 28 in the journal BMJ Case Reports.\n\nThe condition is usually caused by an allergic reaction to penicillin drugs, but can also be caused by exposure to mercury or nickel, said Dr. Andreas Bircher, a dermatologist at University Hospital of Basel in Switzerland. (He was not involved in the study but has reported other cases of baboon syndrome.)\n\nIn the present case, during the man's initial examination, he had enlarged and inflamed tonsils, according to the physicians at the NHS Lothian hospital in the United Kingdom who reported the case. His regular doctor had prescribed penicillin for him two days earlier, but the patient became unable to swallow. [8 Strange Signs You're Having an Allergic Reaction]\n\nThe emergency-department doctor who saw the man started him on a course of intravenous benzylpenicillin (a different type than the oral penicillin) four times a day and gave him a single dose of intravenous dexamethasone, a steroid medication used to treat inflammation.\n\nBy the next day, the patient had developed a rash over his groins and inner elbow. Assuming it was a reaction to the penicillin, the doctor changed his antibiotic to clarithromycin (which is in a different class of antibiotics).\n\nOn the third day after being seen at the hospital, the patient's throat was much better, and he was able to swallow liquids and soft foods, but his rash had spread and become painful. At that point, the rash covered his armpits, buttocks, lower abdomen and upper thighs, and his groin showed signs of necrosis (dead tissue).\n\nThe doctors had to determine whether the patient was having a severe drug reaction, which would get better on its own, or a dangerous infection of flesh-eating bacteria (necrotizing fasciitis), which would require immediate removal of the dead or infected tissue.\n\nThe team started the patient on non-penicillin broad-spectrum antibiotics, which act against a range of bacteria, and took a tissue sample from his right groin. The sample tested negative for flesh-eating bacteria, so the patient was diagnosed with baboon syndrome.\n\n\"It's not a very common condition,\" Bircher told LiveScience. For unknown reasons, it's more prevalent in males, and usually seen in postpubescent people.\n\nThe patient stopped taking antibiotics, and used oral and topical steroids to treat his rash. He was discharged from the hospital 11 days after being admitted, and the rash disappeared.\n\n\"It's a true allergy,\" Bircher said. With steroid treatment, the rash usually fades within a week, but re-exposure to the drug or allergen can cause a relapse within one to two days, Bircher said.\n\nBaboon syndrome typically appears a few hours to two days after a person takes an antibiotic. The syndrome rarely affects small children, but cases have been reported in an 18-month-old and a 5-year-old, the researchers noted in their case report. Recovery can sometimes take up to three weeks.\n\nExposure to penicillin, nickel or mercury are the most common causes of the syndrome, but it has also been linked to certain heartburn drugs, biological agents and chemotherapy.\n3 Steps To Join #FowlerNation!\n1.

His prolific output of compositions, recordings and publications continue to impact audiences around the world.\n\nKenny was awarded the 2010 Guggenheim Fellowship Award for his seminal work, No Beginning No End. No Beginning No End is a musical journey exploring tragedy and loss, death and transition, and the path from one lifetime to the next. Utilizing over 70 musicians, Kenny's third album for Half Note Records is an expansive composition featuring Joe Lovano, Judy Silvano, Wind Ensemble, Choir and String Quartet.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, NY on November 19, 1951 and then growing up in Oceanside, Long Island, Kenny began playing and performing at a young age, first recording on television at the age of 11. Although he studied classical piano as a child, he enjoyed playing anything he heard on the radio. In high school and his first years of college he attended the Manhattan School of Music as a classical piano major.\n\nHis natural instinct for improvisation led Kenny to the Berklee School of Music in 1970. There he sought tutelage of the renowned piano teacher Madame Chaloff. A Her gracious wisdom and inspiration became a driving force in Kenny's conception: A music conscious of its spiritual intent and essence.\n\nKenny has written many original compositions featuring trios and other small group configurations, but in the mid 1980's, he became the pianist for the Mel Lewis Orchestra (currently known as the Village Vanguard Orchestra). Challenged by Mel and Bob Brookmeyer to write for the band, he produced his first compositions and arrangements for jazz orchestra, consequently leading him to write for the major bands in Europe including the Cologne, Danish, and Stockholm Jazz Orchestras, The Umo Jazz Orchestra of Finland and several times as the guest composer and soloist with the Metropole Orchestra of Holland. He's released two CDs with the Brussels Jazz Orchestra. One released in 2011 is called \"Institute Of Higher Learning.\" Werner has had many commissions to write for large ensembles such as jazz orchestras, full orchestras and most recently, wind ensemble, choir and string quartet as featured on his latest CD, No Beginning, No End. He continues to release Cds . A new solo cd and new Quintet Cd is set for release in 2012.\n\nIn 2007, Kenny Werner released his first album for Blue Note Records.Lawn Chair Society, featuring Chris Potter, Dave Douglas, Scott Colley, and Brian Blade, received critical acclaim for its fusion of electro and acoustic elements. For several years now he has also toured with his quintet featuring David Sanchez on sax, the legendary trumpet player Randy Brecker, Antonio Sanchez on drums and Scott Colley on bass. There recent release on Half Note is titled \"Balloons.\"\n\nQuincy Jones has said of Kenny, \"Perfection, 360 degrees of soul and science in one human being. My kind of musician.\"\n\nKenny groundbreaking work on Improvisation, Effortless Mastery -- Liberating the Master Musician Within, was published in 1996.Using his life experiences as a microscope into the artist's mind, Effortless Mastery is a guide to distill the emotional, spiritual, and psychological aspects of an artists life. Today it is one of the most widely read books on music and improvisation, helping thousands of musicians around the world unlock their talent and potential.The book is required reading at many universities. Werner, without intention, touched off a revolution of inspiring musicians to do inner work on the mind, body, and soul in attempt to upgrade their musical experience from the mundane to the profound. The book is also popular with artists of other mediums and business professionals.  Kenny continues to teach and give clinics in the United States and abroad. He is currently an Artist-in-Residence at New York University.\n\nKenny Werner's influence is unsurpassed.  He has impacted an entire generation of musicians and artists. Despite his creative output, Kenny is still focused on the music.\"I am still more and more aware of the true purpose of the music and the people who play it: to heal and unite the planet.\n\nHope you enjoyed this Kenny Werner Jazz Harmony Lesson\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1miv4c4OynU", "title": "KILLER *Jazz Harmony Lesson* Effortless Mastery Kenny Werner Random Harmony Exercise JAZZHEAVEN.COM", "publishedDate": "2013-05-23T20:58:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "1mjGvk-M28k", "description": "", "title": "Erodium Palgrave 1 25m", "publishedDate": "2011-06-27T15:52:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "1mjKVWTX__4", "description": "This video tutorial covers the setup and physical placement options for the Electro-Voice ETX Powered Loudspeaker subwoofer models ETX-15sp and ETX-18sp in a cardioid array.", "title": "Electro-Voice ETX Powered Loudspeaker - Subwoofer Cardioid Setup - Tutorial", "publishedDate": "2014-03-25T15:54:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "1mjZFTlpTZo", "description": "Stellar Sea Lions Eden and Mara were taking part in a daily husbandry/training session that was all based on positive reinforcement.\n\nIn this video, you will hear the narrator bring up on how the Mystic Aquarium cares for it's six stellar sea lions and harbor seal as well as how the facility trains their marine mammals. \n\nMara is is the one doing the training session, while Eden, who is temporarily in the video was doing a husbandry session with her trainer before she went back stage for a vet examination. \n\nABOUT ANIMAL HUSBANDRY: Animal husbandry incorporates all methods and practices used to monitor the health of a captive\nanimal. Trainers, veterinarians, and animal care staffers have structured a routine that would allow\nthem to maintain animal health at zoological parks through behavior observation, and medical\nexamination. All work that is done with the animals is then recorded on computers for easy references\nin the near future. All sorts of husbandry exists such and they include blood tests, specimen samples,\ndental and body examination, and ultrasound.

As the creator of this whole branch of Wing Chun, Grandmaster Leung Ting, famously said: \"The sections are only SIMPLE exercises for beginners to understand BASIC Wing Chun principles!\"\n\nWhich variation of the sections you are learning is less important as long as you are learning all their lessons for posture, yielding to and using the opponent's force while using an effective footwork. What is important is intent, never training without the proper threat level from the attacker and counter-attacker, and having an intelligent method for learning the sections.\n\nPractice them step by step, like in the video, stopping between hits. Do each part until they can be performed with full speed and intent, stopping only enough power to not hurt the co-student. He/she is letting you strike for your training benefit, it is your responsibility to respect this and only use enough force for a realistic threat without following through with damaging him/her. Only then move on to adding the next part. When Chi Sau becomes a choreography without challenging each other, it is as useless for combat as a dance.\n\nThe WT sections are a collection of quick and easy-to-learn drills for understanding the basic possibilities and requirements for Chi Sau. The drills teach principles for using sensory input from your opponent in some beneficial ways. They are NOT clever ways to attack an opponent in a fight. They are certainly not sparring, or a replacement for sparring.\n\nIn the 4 (and a half...) Biu Tze sections, the theme is recovering from a mistake. The techniques within these sections can be used by the intermediate student to avoid a certain hit and regain control of the game, but they are even more effective when used by experts to control the game and steer the opponent into positions that allow striking and takedowns.\n\nThe quicker you understand and learn these sections, and (most importantly) move beyond them all, the faster you will master Chi Sau and acquire your own understanding of it. While these sections are great at exploring the techniques of the Wing Chun forms and how they apply in Chi Sau, they may be a bit outdated. There are now other tools that rapidly teach effective Chi Sau technique that also applies to other disciplines like self-defense, MMA and Escrima.", "title": "Wing Tsun 1st Biu Tze section - Part 1", "publishedDate": "2013-06-15T19:33:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "1mtuHiK9Vto", "description": "\u12e8\u1320\u134b\u127d\u1201 \u12a8\u1206\u1293\u127d\u1201 \u12c8\u12f0 \u12a2\u12e8\u1231\u1235 \u12ad\u122d\u1235\u1276\u1235 \u1291 \u1230\u120b\u121d \u12a5\u1293 \u12e8\u12a5\u12cd\u1290\u1275 \u12f5\u1290\u1275\u1295 \u1273\u1308\u129b\u120b\u127d\u1201\u1362\nhttp://illbehonest.com/amharic", "title": "\u1208\u1218\u12f3\u1295 \u1265\u120b\u127d\u1201 \u12c8\u12f0 \u12a5\u130d\u12da\u12a0\u1265\u1214\u122d \u12a0\u120d\u1245\u1231 - \u1260Paul Washer (Amharic)", "publishedDate": "2012-03-10T21:08:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "1mtvGIQk9iI", "description": "From Yair Yint Aung & Thar Thar \"Hate Diary\" Album (2014).\nPlease \"Subscribe\" for more video updates.

In this respect, sulfur is second only to carbon.[1] The most common form found in nature is yellow orthorhombic \u03b1-sulfur, which contains puckered rings of S8.[1] Chemistry students may have seen \"plastic sulfur\"; this is not an allotrope but a mixture of long chain polymeric sulfur forms, two of which have been identified as allotropes.[1] In addition to these there are other solid forms that contain sulfur rings of 6, 7, 915, 18 and 20 atoms.[1] There are also gases, S2, S3; some species only detected in the vapour phase, S4 and S5 and perhaps five or more high-pressure forms, two of which are metallic.[2]\n\nThe range of molecular allotropes possessed by sulfur can in part be ascribed to the wide range of bond lengths (180260 pm) and bond angles (90120\u00b0) exhibited by the SS bond and its strength (the unrestrained SS single bond has a high bond energy of 265 kJ mol\u22121).[1]\n\nEarly workers identified some forms that have later proved to be allotropes, i.e. pure forms, whilst others have proved to be mixtures.[2] Some forms have been named for their appearance, e.g. \"mother of pearl sulfur\", or alternatively named for a chemist who was pre-eminent in identifying them, e.g. \"Muthmann's sulfur I\" or \"Engel's sulfur\".[3] A commonly used naming system uses Greek suffixes (\u03b1, \u03b2, etc.); however, this system predates the discovery of the new forms that have been synthesised rather than prepared from elemental sulfur.\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "Copy of Structure And Allotropes Of Sulphur", "publishedDate": "2010-04-30T07:05:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "1n5N5h7lZ1s", "description": "We produce organic spirits.\nAnd the first Italian Vodka certified Organic: 0.1\n\nORGINE - Laboratorio Liquori Valbormida - Cengio Alto (SV), ITALY", "title": "ORIGINE - Laboratorio Liquori Valbormida", "publishedDate": "2011-03-06T10:50:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "1n5sA0HKUak", "description": "have a listen: https://soundcloud.com/kirrinisland \nbuy the album: http://kirrinisland.bandcamp.com/\nlike me: https://www.facebook.com/KirrinIsland \nbooking & contact: kirrinisland@bloodyhands.net", "title": "Kirrin Island - broad-leaved forest", "publishedDate": "2012-12-17T15:24:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "1n5uFGk2pnc", "description": "Couldn't keep Jamie away from the table!", "title": "Jamie playing multiball (The Original) Ping Pong Baby", "publishedDate": "2012-01-17T00:26:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "1n66T7BR8GE", "description": "Highly requested beginner video on how to apply lipstick, lipliner and lip gloss.

But do we demand it of ourselves? \n\nNo excuses. We are either punctual or we are not. There is no in-between.\n\nHere's one the great benefits of this value: respect. When others know they can rely on you to show up on time, or to start and end a meeting on time, then you earn their respect. Why?

Letters snuck behind enemy lines. Morse code deciphered. Special radio signals, intercepted. It\u2019s one of the most valuable commodities known to man: communication. And today is no different. In fact, we\u2019re learning of a new, massive attack on the communication happening on Capitol Hill. \n\nWorkers at the State Department will have to find new ways to send unclassified emails. The hack attack targeted the unclassified email system and other staffers. Now, the system has been shut down until the techs can get inside and patch the holes. According to an AP report, an inside source says all the systems will be fully operational in the near future, possibly as soon as this week. But while government officials tell people not to worry, the damage has already been done. Emails have been exposed, security has been breached. \n\nBut officials won\u2019t go so far as to say who they think could be responsible. Earlier attacks have been blamed on Russian or Chinese hackers. Could they be at it again? This breach is believed to have happened around the same time the White House computer network was targeted. And those are hardly the first agencies to come under hack attack. The Postal Service and also the National Weather Service have both reported breaches just in recent days. \n\nThat\u2019s right. Federal Government agencies want the right to spy on your private emails and phone calls, but yet, they can\u2019t even protect their own. The excuses of national security are only surpassed by the ineptitudes of national cybersecurity. \n\nSupport Indymedia!\nDonate USD: http://nnn.is/donate-dollars\nDonate BTC: http://nnn.is/donate-bitcoin\n\nDownload your free Next News \"Heroes & Villains\" Poster here: http://nextnewsnetwork.com/the-2013-heroes-villains-posters\n\nLIVE: http://NextNewsNetwork.com \nFacebook: http://Facebook.com/NextNewsNet\nTwitter: http://Twitter.com/NextNewsNet\nSub: http://NNN.is/the_new_media\nMeet the Next News Team: http://youtu.be/2QnNKwQ2WkY\nHashtag: #N3\n\n#SR", "title": "State Department Emails Hacked", "publishedDate": "2014-11-17T20:38:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "1nO9M4jfgo8", "description": "Loonie performs \"Tanyag\" with Abra Live at The Emperor's New Spot, #GrandOpening\n\n#ULTRASOUND now avaible on iTunes and all AstroVision & Odyssey nationwide.\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/loonieversal\nhttps://twitter.com/abraofficial\n\nhttps://instagram.com/loonieverse\nhttps://instagram.com/abraofficial\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/loonieversalstudios\nhttps://www.facebook.com/abra1988\n\n\nFor bookings, guestings, shows and other concerns,\nLook for Josef Amarra at (+63) 906 4206812\nEmail Address: josef_amarra@yahoo.com", "title": "Loonie \u2717 Abra - Tanyag (Live at The Emperor's New Spot)", "publishedDate": "2014-06-23T11:29:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "1nOB_5QICFs", "description": "Receita de creme para rachaduras nos p\u00e9s, caseiro, sucesso no blog, com mais de 70 coment\u00e1rios de aprova\u00e7\u00f5es de pessoas que utilizaram e obtiveram um bom resultado.\n\nNeste v\u00eddeo\" Rachaduras nos p\u00e9s - creme caseiro que realmente funciona!\", voc\u00ea ver\u00e1 o passo a passo e a receita do creme para rachaduras nos p\u00e9s que funciona mesmo!\n\nPara maiores detalhes veja tamb\u00e9m o artigo completo em:\nhttp://www.dicasdacema.com/2013/07/rachaduras-nos-pes-creme-caseiro-que.html\n\nSe gostou, por favor, clique em gostei!\nAjude o canal a crescer, se inscreva no canal !\nSe a dica funcionou e foi \u00fatil para voc\u00ea, comente abaixo e compartilhe para que esta receita ajude mais pessoas!\n\nRachaduras nos p\u00e9s - creme caseiro que realmente funciona!", "title": "Rachaduras nos p\u00e9s - creme caseiro que realmente funciona!", "publishedDate": "2014-01-16T18:42:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "1nOFWxoe0dU", "description": "On May 13, 2010, in his 'Jerusalem, the Holy City' class at UCLA, Dr. Robert R.

Highly radioactive wastes include solid irradiated nuclear fuel assemblies (called spent or used by the industry that creates them) and liquid high-level radioactive wastes resulting from the reprocessing (extraction of fissile plutonium and uranium) of solid irradiated fuel rods. The vast majority of highly radioactive wastes generated in the U.S. come from commercial nuclear power reactors.  Irradiated nuclear fuel rods discharged from commercial nuclear power plants are highly radioactive, a million times more so than when they were first loaded into a reactor core as fresh fuel. If unshielded, irradiated nuclear fuel just removed from a reactor core could deliver a lethal dose of radiation to a person standing three feet away in just seconds. Even after decades of radioactive decay, a few minutes unshielded exposure could deliver a lethal dose. Certain radioactive elements (such as plutonium-239) in spent fuel will remain hazardous to humans and other living beings for hundreds of thousands of years. Other radioisotopes will remain hazardous for millions of years. Thus, these wastes must be shielded for centuries and isolated from the living environment for hundreds of millenia.  For more on the problems of this waste disposal, go to the Radioactive Waste Project site of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service at http://www.nirs.org/radwaste/hlw/hlw.htm .

The word Democracy comes from Ancient Latin democratis meaning \"absolute, total fascist rule\" and then backward engineered in the 16th Century CE to appear sourced from Ancient Greek from Latin demos meaning \"remove, withhold, take away\" and --- cratis meaning \"right of rule; sticks of even size used to mete corporal punishment; official name of fasces (bundle) of bound sticks and axe representing power of rule under Roman law\". Ethnos (e\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) is the Ancient Greek term describing \"a small group of people\" and later as ethnikos (e\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2) a \"nation of people\". https://www.facebook.com/vitrohype  It is never enough brutal robbery - It is a Zionist World Order Organisation, or what else is the use of a Zionist World Organisation?

I don't know how many times I have seen patriots get angry or enraged in public forums because the mention of God is made when it comes to the New World Order. They proclaim the New World Order is about politics and not religion as they task away at bits and pieces exposing the lies and deceptions of the order. How shocked will they be to find out soon enough that the New World Order is a politicalization of religion and that the two can't and won't be separated.The entire purpose of the New World Order is to bring Lucifer down to earth and enforce worldwide worship of him as God. Satan's right hand man on earth whom the Bible calls the False Prophet, will implement and enforce worldwide worship of Lucifer as God. The Bible refers to them as beasts because that is exactly what they are.\n\nMost know Lucifer as one of these last days beast's as the Antichrist. The occultic groups call him \"the One\" or the \"God of Light.\"  Some say Lucifer will just arrive as himself masquerading as an angelic being, others declare it will be a human political or religious figure who dies and then comes back to life and then visibly descends to earth from heaven.\n\nThe New World Order is about dictatorial control. Not just here in America or over America, but an order which will govern over the entire world as a  4th Reich. It is about worldwide government and control over the masses. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8HVt8KTMwg", "title": "ZWO ( Zionist World Order )", "publishedDate": "2014-05-24T15:04:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "1nbBpVo9_pg", "description": "Trailer of 'L'Enfant' ('The Child') by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, 2005.

Chait.\n\nOK, the company might just be excited that they have six fossilized specimens that will go for $4,000-to-10,000 when they hit the auction block July 26, but just look at the descriptions they gave us for these photos. They're a labor of love, like a vintner describing the steak au jus to be paired with a vintage cabernet:\n\nCOLLECTION OF 5 COPROLITES\nEstimate at auction: $4,000-6,000\n\nAlthough it is often impossible to tell which species produced these fascinating petrified feces, it is supposed that the fine examples found in a small area of Washington State are from a Miocene turtle. It is also suggested that rather than being coprolites, they are in fact cololites, internal casts of the intestine. What is undeniable is their evocative and varied form, superbly demonstrated in this collection of five different examples, two of finely textured botryoidal form, one in rich rusty red, the other a dark purple-brown, attractively speckled in white; one from a creature apparently in need of a more fibrous diet, of unusually soft definition in warm orange-ochre; and two with deeply cracked surfaces exactly like dried excrement, in green-gray and burnt umber, 4 to 6 inches long.\nMmm. Warm orange-ochre.\n\nENORMOUS AND RARE COPROLITE\nEstimate at auction: $8,000-10,000\n\nThis truly spectacular specimen is possibly the longest example of coprolite - fossilized dinosaur feces - ever to be offered at auction. It boasts a wonderfully even, pale brown-yellow coloring and terrifically detailed texture to the heavily botryoidal surface across the whole of its immense length. The passer of this remarkable object is unknown, but it is nonetheless a highly evocative specimen of unprecedented size, presented in four sections, each with a heavy black marble custom base, an eye-watering 40 inches in length overall.\nUNPRECEDENTED, 40-INCH DINOSAUR FECES WITH A BLACK MARBLE CUSTOM BASE.

Her work -- as a researcher, a scientific leader and an educator -- has helped propel Ontario to the forefront of the competitive international stage for stem cell research. Dr. Rossant's research interests centre on understanding the genetic control of normal and abnormal development in the early mouse embryo using both cellular and genetic manipulation techniques.

These women will receive counseling, legal advice and opportunities to learn new skills.

An easy recipe from Knorr.\n\nThis is a great example of a one-pot dish. First I make a very light roux sauce which I flavour with tomato juice and -- the secret ingredient -- a Knorr Fish Stock Pot. I then add in fish and seafood, marinated with a few spices, and very gently poach it in the Knorr Fish Stock Pot sauce. The beauty of cooking the fish in the spiced tomato sauce is that it means that the dish retains all its goodness and flavour.I've used salmon, snapper, sustainably-sourced cod and prawns for this Mediterranean fish stew, but feel free to experiment with your own choice of fish and seafood.\n\nIngredients\n2tbsps olive oil\n1kg assorted fish (salmon, red snapper and sustainably-sourced cod), skinned and cut into even-sized chunks and seafood (raw peeled prawns)\nA generous pinch of smoked sweet paprika\nA generous pinch of saffron strands\n1 sprig of thyme\n20g butter\n20g flour\n250ml tomato juice, diluted with 250ml of water to make 500ml diluted tomato juice\n1 Knorr Fish Stock Pot\n1tbsp chopped basil\n125g carrots, chopped into short, fine strips, blanched for 1 minute, then refreshed in cold water\n2 stalks of celery, cut into short, fine strips, blanched for 1 minute, then refreshed in cold water\n\nYou can also find out more about this recipe here: \nhttp://www.knorr.co.uk/recipes/detail/8411/1/mediterranean-salmon\n\nFor more fish recipes from Knorr and Marco Pierre White, please visit: \nhttp://www.knorr.co.uk/article/detail/475025/top-fish-recipes\n\nIf you liked this, why not also try:\n\nBeef and Guinness Stew - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-wRV-vsHg\nGreek Style Beef Stew - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jss8BLYDxtU\nMarco's Quick Lamb Stew - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOb3tNkqvsY\nLamb Shanks Stockpot Casserole - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08H-VFULJ0A", "title": "Mediterranean-style Fish Stew Recipe | Marco Pierre White", "publishedDate": "2012-08-02T16:38:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1nlZ2jFIxyM", "description": "briony otoole singing with the cork school of music big jazz band.", "title": "Briony O'toole - orange coloured sky", "publishedDate": "2014-03-21T10:33:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "1nlsRLFgYCA", "description": "Gnostic - \"Realms of Apollyon\" taken from \"Hatewar 666\" Raw Black Metal from Texas featuring Thornspawn members.

It is carved out of a cliff face in the southern part of Sichuan province in China, near the city of Leshan. It is the largest carved stone Buddha in the world - 71 metres (233 feet) tall \n\nPhoto number 8:\nThis Photo got very famous around the web during 2003, under the name \"shark in wave\", it is  A real, unaltered photo taken by photographer Kurt Jones on April 19, 2003 in Australia (you can order prints of the photo from his website). \nKurt Jones wrote on February 9th, 2004:\nit's a dolphin, NOT a shark......sorry to disappoint.\nThey are fairly frequent visitors to that break, but I've never seen one do this before or since....\n\nPhoto Number 7:\nPlane Hits Truck, Guatemala, 1976\nPhotograph by Robert W. Madden\n\"Buffeted by crosswinds, a rescue plane crashes into a truck, while trying to land on a mountain highway near Sanarate. Miraculously no one suffered serious injury.\" \nFrom \"Earthquake in Guatemala,\" June 1976, National Geographic magazine\n\nPhoto Number 6:\nThis photo got very famous around the web under the name \"Holy Cow!\", but actually that is not a cow, that's a wallaby (a small kind of kangaroo), The snake is an Olive Python and the photo was taken in Western Australia.\n\nPhoto number 5:\nThe woman uploaded this photo to the web talked about it on March 2008:\n\"I was visiting my brother in Courtenay, BC. We went for a hike at Seal Bay Park. This picture was taken at the end of the walk...we were inspecting some really cool butter mushrooms on a mossy log. My mom decided to take a picture, but she's not very good at it, so it came out totally off center. the wolf wasn't even noticed until after getting home, and my mom had put the pictures on the computer. She didn't even notice at first, but my other brother was like \"what the hell is that??!!\".\" \n\nPhoto number 4:\nAt first glance you might mistake a bell-mouth spillway for a watery vortex into another dimension. What can only be described as a giant hole in the water is actually a method for controlling the release of flows from a dam or levee into a downstream area. These spillways help prevent floods from destroying the dam. Located in northern California, the Monticello Dam's is the largest morning glory spillway all over the world. \n\nPhoto number 3:\nPhotographer Thomas P. Peschak tell about his photo:\n\"I wanted to shot a photograph that would tell the story of our research efforts to track white sharks using kayaks. When the first shark of the day came across our sea kayak it dove to the seabed and inspected it from below. I quickly trained my camera on the dark shadow which slowly transformed from diffuse shape into the sleek outline of a large great white. When the shark's dorsal fin broke the surface I pressed the shutter and the rest was history.\"\n\nPhoto number 2:\nThe once-in-a-lifetime photograph of 17 dolphins muscling in on the humans during a professional surfing competition was taken by John Pauling, a South African surfing photographer ... he's been surfing since 1965, and has worked as a professional photographer since 1973 (all his adult career).\n\nPhoto number 1:\nPhotographer Bence M\u00e1t\u00e9 tell about this photo:\n\"I was photographing hummingbirds when I heard the sharp, alarming noise of the birds reacting to the presence of a predator. Sixty feet away from me this green-crowned brilliant was fearlessly attacking a viper. This encounter was one of the most interesting ones I had ever seen, and I quickly set up two flashes to increase the light and shutter speed, using one flash fired from the background and another from the camera\"", "title": "World's most amazing photos - Part 1", "publishedDate": "2011-07-02T21:24:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "1nn2k-YGg3w", "description": "Featuring,\nSlim Jones & Hooch\n\nLyrics:\n\nPatrick Swayze (Red Dawn):\nIt is world war 3 down there\nPeople are being killed\nThose could be Russians\n\nChorus:\nNow we, hide\nWe, stay strong\nNow we, survive\nThis, Red Dawn\n\nVerse 1: (Slim)\nWoke up today all I seen was radiation\nOn the landscape dead cause noxious fumigation\nShit ain't been the same since the Russians invaded\nChina piggy backed and proceeded to destroy my nation\nBefore the bombs went off I was smoking a blunt\nNever even seen one till the nuclears dropped\nEveryone you've ever known unsuspecting in their homes\nAnd when you call the city all you hear is dial tones\nWe waited too long and now everyone trapped\nIf you ain't sick or shot your in a FEMA camp\nCan't live off the land when nothing is growing\nWhen everyone's a threat it's hard to be a soldier\nWhile I set and reminisce I plot a solution\nEven in apocalypse I won't stop moving\nEven when I'm dropping clips I'll still reload em\nYou can even send a Russian jet I'll still blow thru em\nBut I need the tanks and armored cars \nGet everything out your garage\nWith little hope we still resist \nWith no guns we use our fists\nIt's still the land and home that's free \nEven if most of y'all just don't believe\nConsider me, your commander in chief\nand Hooch the Recluse my VIP\nThe economy went thru a lobotomy\nAttention from astrology turned to moronity\nBut I still have faith resurrecting my people\nAnd if you follow in my ways we will defeat evil\nDoesn't matter if your Russian Arab Asian or Brit\nRed white and blue got you looking like a bitch\nBefore you press the red button and set it off\nJust now that we'll survive it coming out the Red Dawn\nsaid...\n\nChorus:\nWe, strive\nWe, move on\nNow we, die\nThis, our cause\nNow we, hide\nWe, stay strong\nNow we, survive\nThis, Red Dawn\n\nVerse 2: (Hooch)\nThey coming after me for speaking the truth\nY'all bitches better learn about Hooch\nAre you ready for misery pain and stupidity\nPaint your country as a different entity\nI'm trying to spread the knowledge\nBut they only trying to hear that in college\nChina buying Russians spying\nThey trying to take our home I ain't lying\nIf it comes to war then I'm ready for it\nYou gon have to kill me or Slim Jones boy\nWe don't stop even shoot a cop\nWon't catch me until my body drop\nThey threw a smoke bomb I pulled the pin out the grenade\nJumped out with an AK bullet proof vest while I'm wearing my shades\nYou want it with me bitches y'all gon end up in some ditches\nWe some artists don't get us started standing up against these con artists\nThese elitists and globalists thinking they can hold all of us\nBut see we ain't easily persuaded by the fucking TV\nMedia for the empire ain't a conspiracy bitch I ain't lying\nLook at the facts and try to find the truth\nThey hiding from me and they hiding from you\nBest believe there's a storm brewing\nAnd when it comes the whole world gon be moving\nDump him in the river let his ass float away\nRockefeller mother fucker aiming at your way!\n\nChorus:\n\nRed Dawn (1984):\nThey fought here alone, and gave up their lives\nSo that this nation shall not perish from the earth...\n\nSlim Jones Productions", "title": "Red Dawn", "publishedDate": "2014-07-31T05:34:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "1nnHGE0sVl4", "description": "A big gravid female Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus) found in a prairie fen in southeast Michigan.", "title": "Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake", "publishedDate": "2013-06-04T14:08:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "1nnSM7kqaxo", "description": "New Jae Bee Entitled \"No Tomorrow\" (Prod.

You do it everyday when you walk. You bend, you straighten your knees as you transfer your weight from left to right. Sometimes you have to really relax the hips in order to feel it. Get a mirror. The only thing you're gonna do is transfer your weight from right to left, bend the one leg and straighten the other one. You use your hips in a rotation, an eight. That's what we call it.\n\nSo, you have an eight, a rotation to it. As you're transferring your weight and a straight and bent knee. If you have your legs straight your hip automatically will be up. The bend leg automatically you hips should be down. So, never do this. Again, if you keep changing your weight and moving your hips it gets better. You can get better at it by practicing then you can start adding in more. It's all about your body. It's all about how you can move your shoulders, your back, your hips.\n\nSpeaker 2: It makes the dance much better. In meringue if you were just to dance meringue without Cuban motion it would look a lot like a march and that's not fun. \n\nSpeaker 1: Also, you don't want to lift your feet off the floor like that. It looks robotic. \n\nSpeaker 2: So, when you use Cuban motion and meringue you're adding the flavor it needs.

This is what the CCP doesn't like.\"\n\nHowever, a political commentator Lin Zixu thought, the\nCCP must have known something before the DPRK launched the rocket.\nIt's very possible that the launch was\ncontrolled by the CCP.\n\nLin Zixu: \"The current North Korea is like a vegetative state.\n\nWithout the blood transfusion from CCP, the North Korean\nregime simply cannot sustain for more than a few days.\nBesides, Kim Jong-un's power isn't solid so far, and he won't\ndare to launch the rocket without the permit from the CCP.\nAfter the rocket was launched, CCP is the first one that\njumped out to blame it, which tries to conceal, but gives itself away by the act.\"\n\nIn addition, as Lin Zixu pointed out recently, the international\ncommunity criticized CCP for its persecution on human rights.\nAt the same time, the neighboring countries also rebound\nThere is the South China Sea issue as well. Furthermore,\nthe U.S. president visited Myanmar in a high-profile.\nAll of these made CCP very passive and isolated in diplomacy.\n\nLin Zixu: \"North Korea jumped out to provoke,\nCCP pretended to condemn.\nThis process gave CCP a chance to stand with other countries\nwhich looks like it has a common view with the international community.\nCCP tried to build relationship with\nother counties in this way.\"\n\nLin Zixu also thought that CCP can present itself\nas the boss of DPRK,\nwhich will give the international community\nan impression that only CCP can deal with DPRK.\nIn the process, CCP also will set some pre-conditions\nin which it will achieve interests in political and military.\n\nLin Zixu: \"In plain words, North Korea is a card of CCP.\nCCP plays it when it needs to.\nNorth Korea is exhausting all resources to build up\nits military power and doesn't care about its image,\nwhich is the image of a rogue. Then, when there's something\nthat CCP is shy of doing do will arrange North Korea to do.\nThe brothers play the game together.\"\n\nThe United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1874,\n\nto ban North Korea conducting a nuclear test, and any\nemission activities that related to ballistic missile technology.\nThe spokesman of the White House National Security Council\nTommy Victor, also issued a statement that the U.S. will\ntake appropriate action in the following period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\u300a\u795e\u97f5\u300b2011\u4e16\u754c\u5de1\u6f14\u65b0\u4eae\u70b9\nhttp://www.ShenYunPerformingArts.org/", "title": "North Korea's Persistent Willfulness Angers CCP", "publishedDate": "2012-12-14T03:58:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "1nsgNiCiEF8", "description": "Acrimony \"Herbe\" in German, is the name or title, with which STRUCTURAL FAULT, baptizes his second album.\nSTRUCTURAL FAULT: is a project of a single member, based in Buenos Aires (Capital Federal) Argentina.

An excerpt of the modern version, \"All for Me Grog,\" comes at the end!\n\nI am not thrilled by the process I went through to create this rendition. The issue was a lack of adequate sources related to it as a chanty (or at least a sailor song) on one side, whereas on the other side there is a considerable yet scattered body of material on this and well known popular versions.\n\nMy aim was to look at the sailor song or chanty side. And that is an area that is confusing. For one, absolutely none of the literature on 19th century chanties mentions the song. Hell, even Stan Hugill, who it seemed tried to cram every usable song he knew with even a whiff of sailor aroma under that label, doesn't mention it. \n\nYet suddenly we have JM Carpenter's collection of about 4 dozen informants, made in Britain (and a little in America) in 1928-29. Among the 98 or so different chanties, \"All for the Grog\" is there -- in an astounding 8 renditions! They are all what one might call \"fragments.\" The info one can gather from the current on-line form of the archive is limited. Some entries indicate there are 1-3 lines (verses?) on file. I give below what it includes, for each.\n\n1. Harry Bowling (Los Angeles)\nLyric: \"I have an old shoe with never a back or tongue\"\n\n2. Alexander Henderson (Dundee) - first shipped 1885\n[no lyric]\n\n3. Tom Lucas (Cricklade)\nLyric: \"Once I had a good hat, an a good hat was he\" \n\n4. George Methias - first shipped 1870, with Richard Warner (Cardiff) - first shipped 1877\nLyric: \"Aul for the grog\"\n\n5. Robert Yeoman (Dundee) - first shipped 1869\n[no lyric]\n\n6. William Rennie (South Shields) - first shipped 1880\nLyric: \"O I had a little boat, a jolly little boat\" \n\n7. Jack Murray (Aberdeen) - first shipped 1867\nLyric: \"Oh shirts I've got one and the collar it's wore done\" \n\n8. James Henderson (Dundee) - first shipped 1872\nLyric: \"All for the grog, the jolly, jolly grog\nAll for your pipes and tobacco\nFor I've spent all my tin on yon ladies drinking gin\nAnd across the briny ocean I must wander\"\n\nThe reason I have so many words for the last is because I have the recording of that one, and was able to transcribe them. Also, it means I have a tune\u2014the one I'm singing here. The tune itself seems unusual to me, and took a lot of listening to grasp (and I hope I've got it). It begins almost at a secondary tonal center before arriving at the real tonal center at the end. I am tempted to think James Henderson shifted keys midstream. Or, perhaps he is singing a sort of \"harmony part.\" Not sure, but this is it!\n\nNow, why is it that Carpenter found so many samples of this song, but it does not turn up elsewhere as a chanty? Aside from happenstance, my guess is there may have been something in Carpenter's method that either led singers to recall it or which simply put it in the chanty category. Well, even if it wasn't a common chanty, this is at least proof that sailors knew it. Perhaps Carpenter, being aware of the song...and at some point getting the idea or told it was a chanty by his first informant, later prompted informants for it. It is not totally clear what songs he collected were meant as chanties, either, so it may simply have gotten categorized that way.\n\nAssuming it *was* a chanty, I wanted to learn the sailors' form of the song. J. Henderson's recording only provided *the chorus*, so I compiled the other sailors' lyric fragments and extrapolated from them for verses.\n\nI was guided in the extrapolation by the one other sailor (non-chanty) source I know, which is in Helen Creighton's _Songs and Ballads from Nova Scotia_ (1966). Creighton got the song, which she titled \"Western Ocean\" from the singing of Richard Hartlan (and family) of Halifax County in 1943. \n\nHartlan's version has the pattern of each verse describing a worn-out item\u2014as in Carpenter's collected fragments. (Hartlan's tune is completely different from Henderson's, however.) This pattern can be distinguished from the well-known modern version that suggests each item has been lost or pawned due to compulsive spending on grog, beer, and tobacco. \n\nThe shoreside versions also go under such titles as \"My Old Hat that I Got On\" and \"All Through the Drunk.\" Creighton speculated it was originally a music-hall song, which sounds plausible; research on that is outside the scope of my present sailor song interest. \n\nInterestingly, the sailor versions mention \"rum\" (the sailor's drink par excellence) or \"pipes\" and tobacco, rather than the modern (Clancy Brothers-style) \"beer\". It seems to me that the former were items more likely to be enjoyed by the sailor, even at sea, while the latter is something more enjoyed in pubs!\n\nThe end of the video contains an excerpt from the \"modern\" version, by the Scrimshaw Crimps (2006), led by long-time chanteyman Rev Carr!

In the last interpretation, this controversial figure is singing Western opera. \n \nNow a three-dimensional cartoon series named The Bright Moon of Qin is profiling a young and handsome ruler. People still show a great interest in that period of time, because the reign of Ying Zheng has left profound influence on our life, like the unification of Chinese characters, currencies and measurements.\n \nThe Bright Moon of Qin will offer a different perspective with the help of advanced computer technology.The 20-part cartoon features a blend of martial arts and heroic legends of the Qin Dynasty and centers on the fate of Jin Tianming, a 10-year-old orphan. \n \nTo escape the murder commanded by the First Emperor, Ge Nie, a top swordsman, embarked on a dangerous adventure with Jin Tianming, the only son of his old friend. Li Si, the prime minister, persuaded Wei Zhuang, Ge's ambitious and treacherous fellow disciple, to kill the two fugitives and the fight between the righteous and the evil unfolds. \n \nThe plot is derived from the idea of Sayling Wen, late Taipei-based entrepreneur and writer. An enthusiast of the wuxia (martial arts) literature since childhood, Wen spent his past few years writing the historical-and-martial art series The Bright Moon of Qin. He had only completed the first part The Episode of Jin Ke before he died in 2004. But he had the scenario of the rest settled through discussions with other writers and critics. \n \nThe Bright Moon of Qin series chronicles the rising and the abrupt fall of Qin Dynasty in a span of 30 years. Important historical events, such as constructing the Great Wall and burying Confucian scholars alive and burning their books, are trailed through the adventure of the hero, Jin Tianming. Tales of swordsmen and hermits and various schools of thought also share the stage. As Jin matures into a real hero, his mysterious identity is gradually unveiled. \n \nMost of the domestic cartoons are for children under 12, which is affected by a stereotype that cartoons do not suit the older students and grown-ups. But the popularity of high quality cartoons from abroad among teenagers and adults has proven that wrong. \n \nThe Bright Moon of Qin is not a textbook. The plot is adherent to basic historical facts. But meanwhile, the animation Co.,Ltd has employed appropriate imaginations in enriching the scenes and characters that were not detailed in historical records.\n \nFashion and humor are the other keywords of the production.

It was first known in the 17th century, later it became a dangerous devil to human life.\n\nAgain Diabetes is differentiated in to two types\u2019 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Diabetes mellitus is mainly caused by deficiency of insulin due to either lack of energy in pancreas (or) any auto-immune disease. While diabetes insipidus is caused by defect in secretion of vasopressin (Antidiuretic hormone) which is secreted from pituitary gland present in hypothalamus.  Its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the kidney and due to this it control the concentration of urine. But its deficiency caused increased water excretion through urine even in low intake of water.\n\nDiabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are unrelated, although they have similar signs and symptoms like excessive thirst and excessive urination. Diabetes mellitus is more common than the Diabetes insipidus. \n\nDIABETES MELLITUS:\n\nThere are mainly three types of Diabetes mellitus.\n\nTYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\nThe body does not produce insulin due to dis-function of pancreas. Such diabetes called as insulin dependent diabetes. People usually develop type-1 diabetes before their 40th year often in early adulthood (or) teenage years.\n\nToday type 1 diabetes has no proper treatment in all over the world.  So these individuals are insulin dependent to rest of their life. Approximately 23 % of all diabetes cases are type \n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\u00fc Unusual weight loss.\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Increased urination (sometimes as often as every hour).\n\u00fc Nausea perhaps vomiting.\n\u00fc Blurred vision.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Dry mouth.\n\u00fc Itching skin.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nTYPE 2 DIABETES:\n\nGlobally as of 2013 an estimated 382 million people have type 2 diabetes worldwide. About 90% cases are type 2 diabetes. This is happening due to lack of energy in the pancreas. So that pancreas cannot produce sufficient insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in our body.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES:\n\n\u00fc Unusual weight loss (or) gain.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Excessive hungry.\n\u00fc Weak eye sight.\n\u00fc Increased urination (especially during night times).\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nGESTATION DIABETES:\nThis type of diabetes usually occurs in pregnant mothers during gestation (pregnancy) period. So there is an increase in high blood sugar in pregnant mother. Most gestational diabetes goes away after child birth, but it does put you at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF GESTATION DIABETES:\n \n\u00fc Increased urination\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness\n\u00fc Increased thirst\n\u00fc Nausea and vomiting\n\u00fc Blurred vision\n\u00fc Weight loss\n\u00fc Hormonal imbalance\n\u00fc Head aches\n\u00fc Body pain \n\nDIABETES INSIPIDUS: The several forms of diabetes insipidus are:\n\nNEUROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\nNeurogenic diabetes insipidus is more commonly known as central diabetes insipidus. It is caused by the damage of pituitary gland present in hypothalamus region (or) other reasons like autoimmune, infection, surgery, head trauma, and some drugs.\n\nNEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nNephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an improper response of the kidney to ADH, leading to a decrease in     the ability of kidney to concentrate the urine by removing free water.\n\nDIPSOGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nDipsogenic diabetes insipidus is defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus. This defect results in the inability for water deficit to trigger vasopressin secretion and thirst.

If you notice different changes that you are experiencing, you may be going through something called precocious puberty, so look in the mirror. \n\nIf you're a girl about seven, or younger, and you notice any hair on your upper lip, if you have breast development, if you have underarm hair or pubic hair, if your body is starting to change shape, you're a little curvier, gaining weight. Or if you're a boy and notice some of these changes, like hair on your upper lip, your voice is starting to change, you have underarm hair, you have some changes in your genital area, you may be developing sooner than most people your age. And this is called precocious puberty. \n\nPrecocious puberty tends to run in families. It's more common in girls than boys, and it's more common in overweight girls than it is in girls of normal size. Usually there's nothing wrong if you're developing a little bit earlier than your friends. But sometimes it could be the sign of something going on, something like hormone issues, or a side effect from a medication. \n\nIt's a really good time to speak to your parents if you have any concerns, and your parents can make an appointment with your doctor. The doctor can refer you to someone called a pediatric endocrinologist. And that's a specialist who deals with children and specializes in hormones and growth issues. \n\nBut don't worry. Everybody develops at their own pace, and everybody and your friends will catch up with you in no time.", "title": "What Is Precocious Puberty? | Puberty", "publishedDate": "2013-04-18T16:26:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "1oB1LOoG5BM", "description": "", "title": "populus meus", "publishedDate": "2014-04-19T21:37:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "1oB7ZSwgNm4", "description": "Bismillahirramanirrahim\nCrescent shape rainbow appeared  right above Osmanli Dergahi  I tried to  record with my cell phone.", "title": "Crescent shaped  Rainbow  appeared over Osmanli dergahi  December 20, 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-12-20T22:52:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "1oBAAicj5eo", "description": "Music: Donut Plains\nComposer: Soyo Oka\nPlaylist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL257494FCC2985545\nPlatform: SNES", "title": "Donut Plains - Super Mario Kart", "publishedDate": "2012-07-07T21:01:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "1oBRK15fa9o", "description": "Want a job after college?

The Columbus Zoo is only the third zoo in North America to successfully hatch a kiwi chick since the first one hatched at Smithsonian's National Zoo in 1975 and this chick is only the fifth kiwi to successfully hatch in as many years. \n\n\"The fact this egg successfully hatched is a testament to the amazing care and attention given by our staff in consultation with professional colleagues around the world\" said Columbus Zoo and Aquarium President and CEO Dale Schmidt. \"Like an expectant parent, kiwi expert Kathy Brader from Smithsonian's National Zoo rushed to Central Ohio to be here and assist our team with the newly hatched chick.\"\n\nKiwis are flightless birds about the size of a domestic chicken and the egg, weighing as much as 20% of the female's body weight, is the largest egg in relation to body size of any bird. The female kiwi lays one egg at a time in the burrow occupied by the male kiwi. In the wild the male completes the average 86-day incubation process on his own. \n\nAt the Zoo eggs are checked to see if they are fertile 30-45 days after they are laid. To maximize the potential of a successful hatching a fertile egg is placed in an incubator where it is monitored for temperature and humidity and turned slightly each day. Once the chick pips the egg it takes about four days for it to completely emerge and it survives on its yolk sac for 6-12 days.\n\nKiwi chicks are miniature versions of the adult kiwi and are about 1/8 of the size of an adult when they hatch. They are precocial, meaning they are completely on their own after hatching, and must find food and avoid predators without assistance. Most birds locate their food through sight and have a relatively poor sense of smell. Being nocturnal, the kiwi's senses are just the opposite and they use their long beak to forage through leaf litter sniffing out earthworms and other invertebrates, fruits and berries.\n\nKiwis have a high mortality rate in the wild mostly due to predation by invasive species; 50% of kiwi eggs fail to hatch, 90% of chicks do not survive to six months of age and only 5% reach adulthood. Kiwi males are sexually mature at two years of age and females are reproductive at about three years old. \n\nThe five distinct species of kiwi are only found in New Zealand and zoos outside of New Zealand only manage the North Island brown kiwi. The kiwi is the unofficial mascot of New Zealand and despite having legal protection since 1896 their numbers are declining mostly due to predation by non-native species including dogs and cats. \n\nThe Columbus Zoo's conservation program has supported projects to protect the kiwi including supplying funds to construct predator proof fencing around reserves and fitting kiwis with transmitters to enable regular monitoring.\n\nThe sex of the chick is determined through DNA testing and not known at this time. In addition to this chick, which is currently not on display, there are three other kiwi at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. There are now just 20 kiwis in three United States zoos.\n\nColumbus Zoo and Aquarium is open 363 days of the year. General admission is $14.00 for adults, $10.00 for seniors 60+ years of age and $9.00 for children ages 2 to 9.  Children under 2 and Columbus Zoo members are free. The Zoo was named the #1 Zoo in America by USA Travel Guide and is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA.)

What's the first thing to do when you see a lion in the area? Leave (leaf)!

Leaves that have spines (claws) around the edges lets you know that you might have the Lion's Paw plant.\n\nMNEMONIC EXPLAINED: This plant has several non-poisonous look-alikes that all, including this one, resemble the common Dandelion. As with people, the surest way to confirm ones identity is to examine fingerprints. Now, from the Dandelion resemblance we extract the word Lion and in order to get the Lion's print you need it's paw (represents plant leaf) which has noticeable claws (represents the small spines around leaf's edges and the distinctly pointed [not round] lobes at the base of leaves) around it. Now, before approaching the lion (lioness) to get the print, vividly imagine her, from a distance, laying under a tree nursing (stems and seeds emit milky sap when cut) her cubs. As you approach the area the cubs run up the tree for safety (picturing this reminds you of the leaf shape [tree trunk represents leaf stem; cubs all along tree trunk represent triangle shaped lobes/leaflets along lower part of leaf stem; tree top/crown represents spade shaped, top part of leaf] and it reminds you of 2 main distinctions from Dandelion other than spiny leaf edges [cubs all along tree trunk represent leaves along plant's main stem and cubs atop tree represents several flowerheads {lion cub heads} atop each stem]).

Now I replaced its failed voice chips and works like new.\nAs you can see, the Juno does the bass, the Yamaha SY77 the PWM lead sound and the JP8000 the filtered pad at the song's beginning. A PWM sound is obtainable on the SY77 by stacking the AnalogSaw1 (whick looks like this: /|/|/|/|/|) and AnalogSaw2 (whick looks like this: \\|\\|\\|\\|\\|) samples, and detuning them. As these samples are both sawtooth waves, but one is inverted, if summed the result is a pulse wave. The detuning rate between the oscillators in this configuration gives the pulse modulation speed.\nThe bass sound is made by taking the #11 preset on the Juno 106 and adding a bit of suboscillator, then transposing the keyboard +1 oct.\nThe pad on the JP8000 is a classic double-sawtooth sound with slow attack, decay and release on the filter, which have a strong resonance setting, as you can clearly hear.\nWell, in this video you also can see my ugly face eheh ;-)\nAs usual, constructive comments are welcome!", "title": "MiMa feat.

So, from a scientific perspective, I see our role as catalyzing the energy of reaction between a small entity and a very large entity and streamlining the process of integrating the two in the terms of a merger and acquisition transaction. The second higher order calling if you like is that of the contribution we make to economic growth and employment and the impact that we have on the world, in terms of getting the invention that the entrepreneur has made and the investors behind that into much larger broader markets. The way they do that is through the acquirer. There's sound economics behind this and it really stems from the early works of a gentleman called Joseph Schumpeter, who was the Austrian finance minister and became a very celebrated economist and, if had they been giving Nobel prizes for economics back then, he would have got one for sure because he is cited by many Nobel prize winners. Then there were another couple of economists in the mid-thirties that took up Schumpeter's work on innovation and drove it through the GDP equation in the form of the investment accelerator. So the idea is that the GDP equation -- which is Y, which is GDP or gross domestic product, equals C, consumer consumption, plus I, investment, plus G, government spending, plus the difference between exports and imports which is X -- M. That this concept of the accelerator, little t applied to the capital I, in the equation drove GDP growth.  Well I would argue that when new innovations come about that they drive change of behavior in every part of the GDP equation.  They change consumer behavior and consumer spending. When you get a new tablet or a new mobile phone comes out you want it, so you spend the money to have it.  People invest in the infrastructure required to make that happen.  Governments spend on it and then it gets exported and you have to subtract imports and that generally leads to growth in the GDP.  That that is our higher calling essentially -- to take innovation from the hands of the entrepreneurs and investors and get those innovations into much larger markets through the large acquirers and have access to those markets.\"", "title": "Mike Shepherd, GrowthPoint Partners - Technology Investment Supports Economic Growth", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06T19:24:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "1oiL4qkndgU", "description": "Ash Borer performing on 9/20/12 at The Oakland Metro.\n\nFell Voices, Menace Ruine, Servile Sect & Sutekh Hexen also played this evening. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Ash-Borer/156748071045193", "title": "ASH BORER - LIVE IN OAKLAND", "publishedDate": "2012-09-21T21:09:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "1oijYJnJ_A0", "description": "*\nCLICK TO WATCH FULL MOVIE - http://irokotv.com/video/2048/the-prince-bride\n\nFrom The Movie: The Prince Bride\nA beauty queen is knocked down in the street and verbally attacks the driver, however after she discovers that he is the heir to the throne of Mazuland she is determined to make him hers.

In addition, Galileo's observations of mountains on the moon and of planets themselves that had objects in orbit around them, the moons of Jupiter, showed that there were worlds within space and led people to think about the possibility of other worlds, other creatures, possible life forms even.  This idea is called the plurality of worlds.

In the video, the director visits various Mennonite communities and introduces members to current technology unbeknownst to them, including iPods, boom boxes, and more, all the while blaring the \"Dum Dee Dum\" track in full blast. The reaction from the Mennonite community to the alien sounds of \"Dum Dee Dum\" is priceless.\n\nKeys N Krates - Dum Dee Dum (Official Video) from the SOLOW EP\nBeatport: http://btprt.dj/16bjvVV\nSpotify: http://spoti.fi/152MQ5N\nAmazon: http://amzn.to/15B99TI\n\nKeys N Krates Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/keysnkrates\nKeys N Krates Twitter: https://twitter.com/keysnkrates\nKeys N Krates Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/keysnkrates\n\nDim Mak Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/dimmakrecs\nDim Mak Twitter: http://twitter.com/dimmakrecs\nDim Mak Instagram: http://instagram.com/dimmakrecs\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/1iIt8r4\n\nBy Any Means Necessary\n\nFor Dim Mak, community comes first.

At least 220 bodies of men from the Albu Nimr tribe, who had been seized by Islamic State days earlier, were found. They had been shot at close range.\n   \n\"What is required from the Iraqi government ... is to offer quick support to the sons of this tribe and other tribes that are fighting Daesh (Islamic State) terrorists,\" Sistani said, in an address read out by an aide in the holy city of Kerbala after Friday prayers.\n   \n\"This will offer the opportunity to the other tribes to join the fighters against Daesh,\" he said. Sistani, 84, is a reclusive figure and always delivers his public messages via a proxy.\n   \nMost of the dead in the mass graves were either police officers or members of a militia called Sahwa (Awakening) that was set up, with the backing of the United States during the its \"surge\" offensive of 2006-2007, to fight al Qaeda.\n   \nWashington hopes Iraq's Shi'te-dominated government can rebuild a shaky alliance with Sunni tribes, particularly in Anbar.\n   \nGeneral Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the United States was prepared to expand its limited mission in Iraq into Anbar province, but only if the government armed the Sunni tribesmen.\n   \nAsked by journalists about this week's killings there, he said: \"That's why we need to expand the train, advise and assist mission into ... Anbar province.\n   \n\"But the precondition for that is that the government of Iraq is willing to arm the tribes.\"\n   \nThe United States no longer is waging a ground war in Iraq but has about 1,400 troops there, with about 600 of them acting in advisory roles to the Iraqis, mostly from joint operations centres in Baghdad and Arbil.

interview in New York, on April 24, 2014\n\nPope John XXIII, who will be canonized on Sunday, was \"the best pope in history for the Jewish people,\" says one of the founders of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.\n\nJohn XXIII, who will be made a saint along with John Paul II at the Vatican, is credited with saving thousands of Jews during the Holocaust and opening the door to Judeo-Christian dialogue, Baruch Tenembaum told AFP in an interview at the Foundation's New York headquarters.\n\nThe Italian-born John XXIII, whose given name was Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, \"did such extraordinary things. I'm delighted that he is becoming a saint, even if -- as a Jew -- beatification doesn't affect me.\"\n\n\"He couldn't have done more than he did,\" explained Tenembaum, a 80-year-old Argentine known for his efforts to improve inter-faith dialogue. In 2009, his name was placed in the running for the Nobel peace prize.\n\nAs the Vatican's envoy to Turkey from 1935, John XXIII helped save the lives of thousands of Eastern European Jews facing persecution from the Nazis, including by giving Hungarian Jews baptismal certificates.\n\n\"At the time, having identity papers labeling you a Catholic was enough to save your life,\" Tenembaum said.\n\nA document on file at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel cites the future pope as being \"among the most sensitive to the Jewish tragedy and most vigorous in rescue efforts\".\n\nA bust of Pope John XXIII sits in the offices of the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation in New York on April 24, 2014\n\nTenembaum has asked that Yad Vashem add John XXIII to its list of \"Righteous Among the Nations\" -- a title honoring non-Jews who showed courage to protect Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nThe International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation honors the legacy of a Swedish diplomat, posted to Nazi-occupied Budapest in July 1944, who is believed to have saved tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews in the final months of the Holocaust by providing them with protective passports.\n\nThe foundation works to preserve his legacy and that of others who saved numerous lives, and not only during the Shoah.\n\nTenembaum has worked hard to publicize John XXIII's work during his time in Turkey, about which there are few official records.\n\nThe scholar also praised John XXIII -- nicknamed \"Good Pope John\" -- for helping open up the Roman Catholic Church to dialogue with other faiths during his 1958-1963 papacy.\n\nLess than three months after being elected pope, John XXIII announced preparations for the Second Vatican Council, a global gathering of Catholic bishops, which opened in October 1962 and proved to be revolutionary, in that it finally acquitted Jews of Christ-killing.\n\nHe was the first to put a stop to the use of the word \"perfidious\" to describe Jews in Good Friday prayers, Tenenbaum said.\n\nDuring his time as a Vatican envoy to France, the soon-to-be-saint played a key role in plans for the partition of Palestine and the creation of the state of Israel.\n\nAccording to diplomats involved in the negotiations, he helped persuade Pope Pius XII to remain silent, effectively allowing mainly Catholic countries to vote on the partition plan free of Church influence.\n\n\"Roncalli's attitude definitely had something with do with the creation of the state of Israel. If the Vatican had given the order to vote against it, they would have voted against it,\" Tenembaum said.\n\nTenembaum says he current Pope Francis, a fellow Argentine, seems to be following in the path of John XXIII.\n\n\"Since the time of Pope John XXIII, I think the pope that most resembles Roncalli is Francis, at least from what we've seen so far,\" Tenembaum said.", "title": "AFP.

Palmer, Burt Sugarman\nScreenwriter: James Carrington, Hesper Anderson, Mark Medoff\nFilm Description: Children of a Lesser God is a love story about a speech teacher who falls for a beautiful yet distant deaf girl in a small New England school for the deaf, and the obstacles that they face due to their differences. William Hurt plays James Leeds, a renegade teacher with an unconventional approach to education and a resume that includes stints as a bartender and a disk jockey. Upon his arrival, he is warned by school administrator Dr. Franklin (Philip Bosco) not to get creative with his instruction. Naturally, Leeds already has his mind set on his teaching plan and proceeds to play loud rock music in class in order to teach the students to feel the vibrations of the music and get them to try to speak phonetically. But a new element enters his life when he meets the attractive custodian, Sarah (Marlee Matlin). An exceptionally intelligent yet extremely bitter young woman, Sarah is a graduate of the school who has decided to remain there, in the confines of her world of silence; it's safer for her to be with her own \"people\" than to face what she perceives as a cruel and uncaring world. She hardly seems interested in James and will only communicate with him through signing, although she can read lips and even speak a little. James learns from Sarah's mother (Piper Laurie) that Sarah was sexually molested as a teenager; this explains why she is so wary of his attempts to form a relationship with her and why she is so full of fear. Eventually, James does get through to Sarah and the two fall in love, although both have to learn new ways to communicate their feelings. Though it seldom resembles the Mark Medoff play on which it was based, this directing debut from Randa Haines won an Best Actress Oscar for Matlin, for her first screen performance.\n\n\"children of a lesser god\",\"william hurt\",\"marlee matlin\",\"randa haines\",\"romantic dramas\",tearjerkers,\"patrick j palmer\",\"burt sugarman\",\"candace koethe\",\"conformity videos\",\"equality videos\",\"frustration videos\",\"individualism videos\",\"house videos\",\"living room videos\",\"james leeds\",\"sarah norman\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9273,/m/016khd,/m/018z_c", "title": "Children of a Lesser God (5/7) Movie CLIP - Never Come Inside My Silence (1986) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T09:18:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "1pK143v_eBg", "description": "", "title": "How-To Draw A Step By Step Nonagon", "publishedDate": "2014-08-22T01:47:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "1pK8kcwLTbA", "description": "En plein direct, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pons l\u00e2che quelques r\u00e9alit\u00e9s sur le Coran, au point de d\u00e9stabiliser le journaliste adepte de la langue de bois et Abidi, pseudo chercheur musulman, qui tente par tous les moyens de  noyer le poisson avec le sourire complice du journaliste.

Some characters are funny when left alone and some are very unique.  When you don't push a button for an x amount of time your character will start doing something random.  I chose 11 games (10 different series) in this first of the series.. Tell me what you think and if I should do another one which I might do 25 in a series...  Some characters like Sonic get impatient and other characters fall asleep like Mario... Some are goofy and some are strange... Hope you enjoy!\n\nAlso, note: There are more Animations to each game, I only selected a few Idle Animations or else the video will be super long...\n\nDefinition of an Idle Animation from Wikipedia \"Idle animations refer to animations within video games that occur when the player character does not do any action (hence being idle). These sorts of animations are largely popular with action games, where players may rarely be idle and thus serve as easter eggs. One of the first games ever to introduce idle animations on a mainstream basis was Maziacs;[1] the sprite taps his feet, blinks, and sits down. This trend spread to many other action genre games, becoming more complex as allowed by the advancing hardware. For example, in Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, Diddy Kong juggles a few balls if the player offers no controller input for a few seconds.\n\nIdle animations in modern 3D games are used to keep them realistic. In general, games meant for younger audiences are far more likely to have complex or humorous idle animations, while games for older people tend to have more basic idle animations. For example in Super Mario 64, Mario will occasionally look around, and eventually fall asleep, while in others, steady breathing suffices as an idle animation.\"\n\nHere's all the games used in order:\n1. Earthworm Jim (Sega Genesis)\n2. Grand Theft Auto 4 (PC)\n3. Jazz Jackrabbit 2 (PC)\n4. Super Smash Bros Brawl (Nintendo Wii)\n5. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (Nintendo 64)\n6. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Nintendo 64)\n7. Super Mario 64 (Nintendo 64)\n8. Conker's Bad Fur Day (Nintendo 64)\n9. Banjo Kazooie (Nintendo 64)\n10  Sonic CD (Sega CD)\n11.

We can find out that when we measured oil-water system such as benzene-water system or nalkane-water system with known reference value using Wilhelmy plate method or pendant drop method , measured value may be differ from reference value. For Wilhelmy plate method, we find out contact angle of water-fluid system is not 0\u00b0, and range of contact angle may be variable from 25-120\u00b0. When we use  modified Wilhelmy plate method to correct contact angle using Young-Laplace equation, measured IFT value will  agree with reference value. But when measuring IFT based on pendant drop method, no contact angle is needed to correct.After serious analysis and compare, we find out we must saturate fluid (benzene or  nalkane) with water at first, then measured value will agee with reference value. Please contact http://www.uskino.com to ask how to saturate fluid with water and what is most suitable method to measure interface tension between water-fluid system. we have achieved a most suitable measurement of IFT used drop shape analysis system (contact angle meter model SL200K series)", "title": "Measuring interfacial tension of benzene water using contact angle meter", "publishedDate": "2014-02-13T04:48:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "1pqYELm0NKM", "description": "This is the Michell Workshop Viscometer. It was first fully explained with the appropriate theory of lubrication treatment by F.R. Archibald in 1956 in an ASME / ASLE paper. Up until that time no one, not even its inventor, A.G. M. Michell of Australia, understood the theory behind it. When the paper was published explaining why it worked, the inventor very quickly wrote F.R. Archibald and congratulated him on his landmark paper in which it appeared.\n\nThe instrument does not find much use in this country, U.S.A., and I suspect has fallen out of favor in Australia and other places. It does have many attractive benefits including simplicity and its ability to measure a wide range of viscosity.

For two years, they devoted their days to constructing their dream studio and spent their nights performing songs by The Police, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones at local pubs to pay the bills. \"We really got down and dirty with dry walling and literally laying the floorboards, and at the same time we were taking a couple of days a week to focus on writing songs,\" recalls Keith Jeffery, Atlas Genius's vocalist/guitarist. \"We had a lot of song ideas and it was important to us to have our own studio where we could experiment and hone in on our sound,\" adds brother and drummer, Michael Jeffery. The studio was designed and outfitted by the brothers with the help of their father (who comes from a music and engineering background). Once the studio was complete, the first song that Atlas Genius finished was a song called \"Trojans,\" which they wrote, recorded and produced in collaboration with their friend, keyboardist Darren Sell. After many weeks tweaking the song, Michael insisted that the song was ready to be heard outside of the studio walls. Within an hour, \"Trojans\" was on the Triple J Unearthed Website, SoundCloud, and for sale via TuneCore on iTunes, Amazon and Spotify worldwide.\n\nQuickly named an iTunes Single of the Week in Australia and New Zealand, \"Trojans\" reached #4 on Hype Machine by the end of May. In August, SiriusXM Satellite Radio's Alt-Nation discovered the song on a blog and decided to give it some spins. There was an immediate reaction from listeners, and in September, \"Trojans\" was placed into heavy rotation, where it maintained a top-five position on the listener-generated Alt-18 countdown and peaked at number one for 4 consecutive weeks in January 2012. \"Trojans\" began selling over a thousand tracks per week on U.S. iTunes and soon climbed to 45,000 sales - all with zero promotional efforts from the still-unsigned Atlas Genius.\n\nThe band's first release from their new label home, the EP Through The Glass (produced, engineered and mixed by the band), came out in June of 2012. With Through The Glass completed, Atlas Genius then holed up in its studio and worked on writing and recording its first full-length album, while at the same time rehearsing for their first ever tour. The tour started in August 2012 and led to three more tours back to back taking them thru to the end of the year. Thus, their full-length debut was finished up between tour dates and got completed just before Christmas 2012. When It Was Now is set for a US release on February 19th, 2013, with an international release to follow soon after.", "title": "Atlas Genius - Back Seat [Official Audio]", "publishedDate": "2012-05-29T20:24:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ptrEA3O6R4", "description": "Treatment of high myopia with Cache Phakic intraocular lens.

The proprietary extraction process helps filter out toxins found in whole cinnamon. It is the only extract standardized for doubly linked Type-A Polymers, specifically tetramers and trimers shown in clinical research to have a host of health benefits, particularly those related to Metabolic Syndrome.* In a recent study, (Ziegenfuss, et al 2007) 83% of those given the active Type A Polymers experienced a significant decrease in fasting blood sugar (about an 8% drop), compared to only 33% in the placebo group. Moreover, subjects additionally showed statistically lower body fat, enhanced lean body mass, lower systolic blood pressure and saw improvements in various antioxidant measures.*\nHow Does It Work?\nUSDA scientist, Dr. Richard A. Anderson has done extensive research regarding the mechanism of action of the doubly linked Type-A Polymers isolated from water soluble extracts of cinnamon. In one particular study, (Jarvill-Taylor, Anderson, Graves, et al 2001) these polyphenolic polymers increased glucose metabolism roughly 20-fold in vitro. Another study, (Anderson, Broadhurst, Polansky, Schmidt, Khan, Flanagan, Schoene, Graves, et al 2004) demonstrated these polymers were effective mimetics of insulin in vitro. In animals, the doubly linked Type-A Polymers appear to have supporting effects on reducing blood pressure. In humans, Cinnulin PF also appears to support glucose transport mechanisms by enhancing the insulin signaling pathways. Cinnulin PF helps metabolic syndrome factors by supporting healthy glucose levels, body composition and blood pressure in healthy individuals. In yet another human study Cinnulin PF showed significant enhancements in some of the regulatory markers related to lean tissue enhancement. (Willouhby DW, in press) Additional findings noted were enhanced trends in markers mean power and strength.*\n\nApplication and Serving Size\n\nCinnulin PF is an appropriate nutritional support product for healthy glucose levels, body composition, blood pressure and antioxidant function in healthy individuals.* It can be administered in a capsule, tablet, powder or liquid. The recommended serving size for Cinnulin PF is 250 mgs twice daily prior to meals.*\n\n* This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.", "title": "AlchePharma Cinnamon (Cinnulin PF )", "publishedDate": "2013-08-30T23:37:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "1purT4__yNo", "description": "Contrast is a breakthrough platform/puzzle adventure that blends a vibrant three dimensional-world from a bygone era with that of elaborate shadow landscapes to create an exquisitely surreal gaming experience.

In barite beneficiation ...\n\n Baryte, or barite, is a mineral consisting of barium sulfate. The baryte group consists of baryte, celestine, anglesite and anhydrite. Baryte itself is generally white or colorless, and is the main source of barium. Baryte and celestine form a solid solution.\n\n The big raw barytes are fed to the jaw barytes crusher evenly and gradually by vibrating feeder through a hopper for the primary crushing. After first crushing, the material will transferred to impact barytes crusher or cone barytes crusher by belt conveyor for secondary crush; the crushed materials will then transferred to vibrating screen for separating. After being separated, the crushed barytes parts that can meet standard will be taken away as final products, while the other barytes parts will be returned to impact barytes crusher, thus forming a closed circuit. Size of final barytes products can bebined and graded according to customer's specific requirement.

He was an active and honest propagator of WAHDAT-E-UMMAT (Unity of Muslim Ummah) and for this cause he struggled in his life till the end. It is his one of the another contribution that he always preached the true essence of Islam, free from any type of negative constraints or influence E.g. schism, exhibition of knowledge, pride or for worldly gain etc. His knowledge was so vast and his memory was remarkable that he used to appreciate the contribution of Ulama (scholars) without any discrimination whether they are Brailvi, Deobandi or Ahle Hadees or whoever else. Maulana Ishaq is equally popular among the youth and the old ones. He is liked among Religious or Liberal class through his teachings/lectures to seek guidance from it. \n\n\nMaulana Mufti Ishaq rahmatullah ailah never associated him to any group (Maslak) instead he always called himself a Muslim and his all lectures are purely related to the original primitive teaching of Islam. He always addressed the issues of the questioners and provided them with best solution. This could only be possible if the Religion (ISLAM) is taken into his complete sense.\n\nHis efforts are appreciable and unforgettable. May Allah bless him with Jannat ul firdous .

Die ledrigen, dunkelgr\u00fcn gef\u00e4rbten Bl\u00e4tter entwachsen der Spitze einer eif\u00f6rmigen Pseudobulbe. Die Bl\u00fcten dieser Orchideen stehen einzeln an aufrecht wachsenden Sch\u00e4ften, die sich aus der Basis der j\u00fcngsten Pseudobulbe entwickeln. Jede Pseudobulbe einer Maxillaria kann zur gleichen Zeit mehrere Bl\u00fctensch\u00e4fte bilden. Die schmalen Sepalen dieser Orchideengattung sind meist ziemlich lang und laufen spitz zu, was der Bl\u00fcte einer Maxillaria ein sternf\u00f6rmiges Aussehen verleiht.\nPflege und Kulturanleitung der Maxillaria\nLicht / Standort\n\nOrchideen der Gattung Maxillaria brauchen das ganzj\u00e4hrlich einen hellen Standort. Trotzdem sollten diese Orchideen niemals direkten Sonnenstrahlen, besonders in der lichtstarken Jahreszeit, ausgesetzt werden, da es sonst zu Sch\u00e4den an den Bl\u00e4ttern kommt.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nHeranwachsende Maxillaria Orchideen werden gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig gegossen Man achte darauf, bei jeder Wassergabe den Topfballen gr\u00fcndlich zu befeuchten. Vor der jeweils n\u00e4chsten Wassergabe, l\u00e4sst man den Topfballen aber zu zwei Dritteln antrocknen.\n\nNach dem Verbl\u00fchen der Orchidee h\u00e4lt man eine kurze Ruhepause von etwa drei Wochen ein. W\u00e4hrend dieser Ruhezeit wird nur so viel gegossen, dass die Erde nicht vollkommen austrocknet und die Pseudobulben nicht schrumpfen.\nTemperatur\n\nIm Idealfall sollte f\u00fcr diese Orchideen die Temperatur ganzj\u00e4hrig tags\u00fcber 19 bis 24 \u00b0C und nachts 15 bis 18 \u00b0C betragen. Falls die Temperatur einige Tage hintereinander 24 \u00b0C \u00fcbersteigt, stellt man die Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00dfe in wassergef\u00fcllte Schalen auf Kieselsteine oder h\u00e4ngt wassergef\u00fcllte Untersetzer unter die Orchideen, sofern diese in Ampeln oder auf Epiphytenb\u00e4umen kultiviert werden. Zus\u00e4tzlich werden die Bl\u00e4tter der Maxillaria  t\u00e4glich mit weichem Wasser bespr\u00fcht.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nOrchideen der Gattung Maxillaria  werden zur Vermehrung im Fr\u00fchjahr geteilt, vorausgesetzt es sind ausreichend viele Pseudobulben vorhanden. Man zerschneidet die Rhizome in zwei oder mehr Teilst\u00fccke. An jedem Teilst\u00fcck sollten sich mindestens zwei Pseudobulben befinden. Die St\u00fccke setzt man in kleine T\u00f6pfe mit einem Durchmesser von 8 bis 10-cm. Alternativ k\u00f6nnen die Teilst\u00fccke der Rhizome auch an einem Epiphytenstamm befestigt werden. Bis zum neuen Austrieb werden die geteilten Rhizome nur m\u00e4\u00dfig gegossen. Danach kann man die Pflanzen wie ausgewachsene Orchideen weiterkultivieren.\nErde / Substrat\n\nGenerell sollte auch eine Maxillaria wie fast alle Orchideen in gut wasserdurchl\u00e4ssigen Substraten kultiviert werden. Bei in T\u00f6pfen kultivierten Orchideen verwendet man ein grob strukturiertes Gemisch aus Lauberde oder Torf, br\u00f6ckeligem Lehm, zerkleinertem Sumpfmoos ( Sphagnum) und scharfem Sand. Besonders bei in T\u00f6pfen kultivierten, eigentlich aber epiphytisch wachsenden Orchideen, setzt man dem Substrat gerne eine Handvoll Holzkohlebrocken zu. Zur Verbesserung der Dr\u00e4nage f\u00fcllt man die T\u00f6pfe im unteren Drittel mit Tonscherben.\n\nEpiphytische kultivierte Maxillaria wachsen in einem Gemisch aus zwei Teilen Rinde oder Osmunda Fasern (dies sind die getrockneten Wurzeln des K\u00f6nigsfarnes) und einem Teil Sphagnum. Grobe Rinde und Osmunda Fasern findet man im Handel auch in gro\u00dfen St\u00fccken. Diese eignen sich gut um epiphytische Orchideen als Aufsitzerpflanzen zu kultivieren.\nUmtopfen\n\nSind die Orchideen zu gro\u00df geworden, pflanzt man sie im zeitigen Fr\u00fchjahr in einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Topf. Nach dem Umtopfen gie\u00dft man die Maxillaria einige Wochen lang nur sehr sparsam, bis die Orchideen gut eingewurzelt sind. Kleine Pflanzen gedeihen gut an Epiphytenst\u00e4mmen mit Osmunda Fasern als Grundsubstrat. F\u00fcr gr\u00f6\u00dfere Maxillaria sind flache Schalen oder Holzk\u00f6rbe besser geeignet.

Bloody Sunday was an event with grave consequences for the Tsarist regime, as the disregard for ordinary people shown by the massacre undermined support for the state.\"\n[from Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_1905]\n\nSubtitles in english and italian.\n\nThis and all Hox Vox tracks/videoclips are released under a Creative Commons 3.0 license, so are free to listen/view, download and share.", "title": "Hox Vox - Outskirt - 06 - \u0417\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446 (Zimniy Dvorets, the Winter Palace)", "publishedDate": "2009-09-13T12:53:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "1qYCWfr2sY0", "description": "Renaissance Literature, Benedictine College 2012.", "title": "How to be a Courtier", "publishedDate": "2012-11-20T06:14:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1qYH0R5o5vw", "description": "Music video by Air Supply performing Here I Am (Just When I Thought I Was Over You).

As a sophomore I had a career high game of 360 all-purpose yards in one game before being called up to varsity to start at receiver and tight end. While I am big, strong and tough, I personally believe my best assets are my versatility, tenaciousness and relentless determination. As you will see in my videos, I have superb hands and am rarely brought down by the first tackler. I take as much pride in making a good block or tackle as I do in making an excellent catch. I am a team leader, always giving 110% and sacrificing for the benefit of the team. Lastly, the effort I put forth on the field is matched by the work I perform in the classroom.

Affected persons develop small pink or red lesions which are rough or scaly, usually appearing on parts of the body which are not typically covered by clothing. In some cases, squamous cell carcinoma develops within these lesions, which is the rationale for their preventative removal.  Any part of the body with consistent sun exposure, most commonly the face,  scalp, ears, neck, arms and top of hands, may be affected . Actinic keratoses are usually 1 centimeter or less in diameter, generally slightly scaly (with occasional instances of lesions which become thick with scale, as with warts), and with a pink, red or brown color variation.\n \nActinic keratoses most commonly affect fair-skinned persons, those who have trouble tanning (in other words, burn easily), those with light-colored (blue, green, hazel) eyes, and those with red or blond hair. Any person with excessive sun exposure, especially during their youth, is at greater risk.   In addition, persons with weakened immune systems due to HIV, chemotherapy or organ transplant have a greater risk of developing actinic keratoses and Skin Cancers.\n \nDifferential Diagnosis (Other conditions with similar appearance)\n Squamous cell carcinoma\n Bowen's disease (squamous  cell carcinoma in situ, a very thin noninvasive type of squamous cell carcinoma)\nBasal cell carcinoma\n Seborrheic keratosis\n Wart\n Benign Lichenoid keratosis\n \nDiagnosis\nKey Points\n *Diagnosis based on appearance and location\n *Skin biopsy may be performed to rule out malignancy\n \nActinic keratosis is generally diagnosed based on appearance of the affected area. Health care professionals may biopsy the affected area to exclude malignancy.\n \n*Prevention is the most important factor in combating the disorder\n *All occurrences should be treated, as the disorder has the potential to become malignant\n *Several treatments exist to destroy the pre-cancerous growths.  Most commonly cryosurgery (destruction by freezing with liquid nitrogen), 5-Fluorouracil topically, Imiquimod cream topically, Photodynamic therapy, and chemical peel are all options to treat AK's.\n *Self-examination is key in the timely recognitiont of actinic keratoses\n \nPrevention of Actinic keratosis by moderating direct sun exposure is recommended. Prevention of sun exposure has been shown to reduce the occurrence of new lesions. Covering the skin with appropriate clothing during times of sun exposure, using sunscreen with a high Sun protection factor (\"SPF\") of 30 or more, seeking shade during prolonged outdoor activities (or planning outdoor activities during the morning or evening hours), and even wearing clothing with an UPF rating can assist in prevention.\n \nIf an affected area begins to change quickly or bleed, attention from a medical professional is recommended. Several options are available to treat or destroy the affected tissue, including the use of creams (Fluorouracil, diclofenac, Imiquimod), cryosurgery, curettage (scraping), dermabrasion, chemical peeling, or laser treatments. Photodynamic therapy has also been shown to help in affected persons.", "title": "Actinic Keratosis Overview", "publishedDate": "2014-01-31T16:30:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "1qktsNxxEGA", "description": "How many times have you asked your English teacher, \"Do I put Hamlet in quotes or italics?\" Please, please, watch this video and quit pestering your poor, overworked teacher.", "title": "Quotes or Italics?

It is something you can really experiment with. Depending on what comes first in the signal chain and what goes last, the guitar being first, the amp being last, and in between that signal chain you can place the order of the pedals in many different ways to achieve a lot of different kinds of sounds.\n\nWe're working with delay, so one of the things that we're going to talk about now is having the delay first, before the distortion. So what we have here is coming out of the guitar, we're going into a volume pedal, which we're going to use to add and remove the amount of guitar into the signal path. Next we have the delay. Then finally the distortion. \n\nWhat that means basically is the signal coming out of your guitar is clean by default. It goes into the volume pedal, and you're delaying first. So the amount of delay in the clean signal, in the true signal is much more intense than if you had the delay last. So you're distorting your overall signal before it gets to the amp.\n\nIf you were to put this in a different order, you would be distorting your clean signal and sending that signal as the true signal into the delay. So you're going to get a much different sound. It's not wrong or right. It's just different.\n\nSo this is what the guitar sounds like if you have the distortion last, the delay first.\n\nYou can really hear the decay when I back off the volume pedal. It's a much more intense delay sound than if you had it the other way around because your clean signal is getting delayed before everything else. The true signal is hitting that first, and that means that all of your signal is being delayed before it ever even gets to the distortion pedal.\n\nSo experiment with that because there's a lot of cool things you can do. You can do all sorts of swells.\n\nWorking with the volume pedal is very cool for that kind of thing. So experiment with that and come up with your own order and come up with your own settings.", "title": "How to Put Delay Pedal 1st w/ Volume Pedal | Guitar Pedals", "publishedDate": "2013-07-07T03:53:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "1qlZiWw2J2w", "description": "Explication en video avec Nicolas Escud\u00e9 Chef de produit Artengo et Damien Caby Entraineur B.E Partenaire technique Artengo.", "title": "Faire de votre coup droit, votre premi\u00e8re force !", "publishedDate": "2013-11-04T10:36:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "1qleZX5e3-o", "description": "Catch up with the top stories from this weekends GT1 racing at Slovakia Ring.The Official YouTube channel of the FIA GT1 World Championship.\n\nWatch live races, exclusive driver interviews and all behind the scenes action.\n\nThe FIA GT1 World Championship is a world championship sports car racing series developed by the SRO Group and regulated by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). It features multiple grand tourer race cars based on production road cars and conforming with the GT1 (2010-2011) and GT3 (2012-) regulations competing in one-hour races on multiple continents. Championships are awarded each season for drivers and teams.\n\nThe FIA GT1 World Championship has started in 2010 as a successor to the previous FIA GT Championship which featured the GT1 category as well as a GT2 category. In 2012 the series originally planned to move away from exclusive use of GT1 cars by allowing 2009-spec GT2 from the former FIA GT Championship as well as current performance balanced GT3 specification cars to compete alongside the series' current GT1 cars. However as there were no interested GT2 teams and only a handful of former GT1 runners were willing to participate, the SRO decided that the 2012 season would be contested with GT3-spec cars only (yet retaining GT1 in the series' title). All vehices will be performance balanced with weight and restrictor adjustments to make different makes artificially more equal.\n\nVisit the home of GT1, GT3 and Blancpain on the web\nhttp://www.gt1world.com/\nFollw us on Twitter for up to the minute updates\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/gt1world\nAnd click like on Facebook for exclusive photos, polls and more!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/FIA-GT1-World-Championship/128187113869543", "title": "2012-Slovakia-WRT-Stippler - The Top Stories from Slovakia", "publishedDate": "2013-03-21T23:43:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "1qlhW1d_zMo", "description": "Like our music?
