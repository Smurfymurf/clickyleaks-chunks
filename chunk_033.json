Preakness Stakes. Kentucky Derby 2013. Orb wins the 2013 Kentucky Derby. Preakness? Belmont? This horse is working a half mile at a training center in Central Virginia. This thoroughbred race horse is not going to make it to the Kentucky Derby, but the few three year olds who do are among the best in the world.\nMost of the three year old champions who make it have already proven themselves as two year olds. There is a lot of controversy about training and racing two year old thoroughbreds, but the people who are against the practice are not equine physiologist, or veterinarians knowledgeable in this field. Starting to train horses young, while their bones and soft tissue are growing, actually gives them a stronger foundation making them les prone to injuries. There are lots of studies, such as the Dr. Nunamaker bucked shin study, that prove early conditioning of the horse, properly, at a young age is advantageous for racing on American dirt surfaces. \nThe problem with soundness in the United State is because of poor breeding practices and running high speeds on dirt or sand surfaces. Not all dirt is created equal and some tracks have better kept surfaces than others. Ultimately grass is the best natural surface to protect the horse of the injuries created by the hard and unforgiving sand. Dirt tracks do not absorb the impacts and vibrations that the horse's joints need them to. The benefit of the grass is the root system itself. The grass' root system provides a cushion of invite impact distribution down into the ground. A properly hydrated turf course is the best surface in preventing high speed thoroughbred horse racing injuries. Unfortunately this is not a reality in the U.S.A. since the turf is a seasonal racing surface and requires more maintenance and money than dirt racing.\nOlder horses and lightly trained horses don't have the bone density that is needed to take the impact created at racing speeds. Improperly conditioned race horses working to fast and too early in their training are setting up for a catastrophic injury. Some of the soundest and sturdiest horses are being worked out as yearlings. Yearlings come in all different shapes and sizes. There are mature yearlings that were born in April and there are some very immature yearlings that were born in January so careful consideration needs to be taken when deciding how far to push a young thoroughbred along. Working out a horse is relative to their ability and stage of training. Earlier when I wrote about yearlings being worked out, this doesn't mean 3 furlongs in 36 seconds. A yearling working out can mean a two minute lick since. An advanced yearling working at a 2 min/mile pace is enough to create the impact needed for conditioning joint strength and bone density. Hearts rate monitors are highly recommended when starting horses young to determine their level of conditioning without guessing when to move forward or faster in their training. These yearlings never really see racing speeds until their two year old year, as they shouldn't. Speed is relative to the horse's ability. While one horse can run a mile in 1:36 at 90% of his ability, another horse maybe all out working 100% at this pace.\nWe are all not so lucky to get an Orb, Kentucky Derby Winner, a Preakness or Belmont winner in the barn, but we can try training thoroughbreds to be the best they are genetically designed to be.

After testing three propane-powered mowers for a year, Sebert fully committed to propane-powered equipment exclusively. The deciding factor in this changeover was knowledge of propane\u2019s environmental benefits. Sebert intends to lead the entire industry to a greener future by using cleaner fuel. Propane\u2019s reduced emissions made it an attractive solution. In addition to saving on fuel costs, using propane was a \u201cwin-win\u201d situation. Propane\u2019s closed fuel system eliminates fuel spillage and pilferage \u2014 common issues with gasoline-fueled mowers. Because propane is self-contained, it will not leak or vent, which results in additional cost savings over time. Jeff Sebert, the company\u2019s owner, reports his employees are happy to come to work and operate day-to-day using fuel that will help make an impact on the environment.

Die Kirche ist in ihrer jetzigen Gestalt 1738/39 \u00fcber den Fundamenten eines alten gotischen Baus errichtet worden. Der Innenraum wurde im 19. Jahrhundert neuromanisch ausgestaltet, wobei fast die gesamte Einrichtung des 18. Jahrhunderts verloren ging. 1893 wurde der Kirchturm wegen Bauf\u00e4lligkeit und Einsturzgefahr abgerissen, 1901 jedoch nach den alten Zeichnungen wieder aufgebaut. Im Hochaltar befindet sich die Barockplastik \"Maria vom Siege\". Die beiden Apostelfiguren neben dem Hauptaltar, Petrus und Paulus, stammen aus Ebbs in Tirol. Die Bruderschaftsstatue des hl. Stephanus im Seitenaltar und ein gro\u00dfes Kreuz mit der schmerzhaften Muttergottes sind Teile der alten Ausstattung der Kirche des 18. Jahrhunderts. Der Tutzinger Maler Karl Gries, der viele Kirchen und H\u00e4user mit Fresken versehen hat, stiftete und malte das Deckengem\u00e4lde mit dem \"reichen Fischfang des Petrus\" sowie den Kreuzweg. Die drei folgenden Glocken (aus Eisenhartguss) sind noch per Hand zu l\u00e4uten:\n\nGlocke I (?, ges') Ulrich, 1918\nGlocke II (St. Agatha, b') Ulrich, 1918\nGlocke III (?, des'') Ulrich, 1918\n\nAuf allen Glocken ist zu lesen \"mich goss Ulrich Apolda 1918\". Leider ist nur auf der Glocke II das Patronat St. Agatha bezeichnet, auf den anderen beiden Glocken steht nichts weiter.\n\nAufnahme: Zusammenl\u00e4uten (per Hand) vor dem Hochamt zu St. Peter und Paul am 29.06.2010\n\nMein herzlicher Dank gilt dem Mesner, Herrn Strunz, f\u00fcr die Erlaubnis der Turmbesteigung.

My name is Andras Baneth and I'm Senior Partner at Online EU Training. Today, I am going to speak about the EPSO assessment centre more specifically the structured interview and even more specifically something what I call the key moment. What do I mean by the role of the key moment in the story or the event that you recall as part of your answer in the structured interview. Well, in every story, in every event that you share with the assessor as part of your answer within learning and development or leadership or resilience, there will be a moment where the given competency or the given conflict or the kick of the events can be highlighted. For instance what I say in part of resilience, the question maybe, 'Could you recall an event when you had to undergo a lot of stress?'  When you recall that specific event, when you were working overtime, you had to finish a project on time and suddenly your computer broke down. Now this simple event or seemingly simple event, where is the key moment in here? Well, the minute or the second when you realised that your computer is malfunctioning and your work maybe in danger. This is the center moment where you can highlight the key competency that the assessors are asking you about. Everything else can be build around this key moment and the entire story can be well wrap around this big event. \n\nThe same thing can happen in learning and development if the question centers on you learning something out of your own initiative and you recall an event when you decided to learn to be rescue diver, or you decided to learn basic Chinese, there will be a key defining moment when you committed yourself to doing that, to performing and to reaching, achieving a certain goal. And the entire story can be centered around this key moment and the competency can be very well demonstrated by focusing on this key event.\n\nThis is Andras Baneth and I hope to see you on Online EU Training.

Jason has regular slots in one of the most popular club events in Finland, and a host of production work released on Black Hole and Meta Recordings to name a few. With his remix work supported by Gareth Emery, Tiesto, Ferry Corsten, DJ's from Mars, etc.\n\n\"Reach\" started out as a remix that Tony was working on. When Jason heard it, he instantly wanted to ditch the remix and start making collaboration out of it. The lyrics and the melancholic melody are telling a story about the lonely moments which artists encounter when they're on the road. It all builds up to the next show with a grooving electro drop, making the crowd bouncing; leading to the main breakdown, before taking you back up to the huge final drop. \n\nThe project comes with remixes from producer friends, Peter Takacs and Moxx, also based in Finland. 'Reach' has already been making waves in the clubbing scene across Finland.

First of all you always cling on your man's strong leg on your lap, I guess. One thing I really like because I'm a pretty chatty gal, and sometimes I get nervous, and obviously key in dealing with that I sometimes don't know how to zip the lip. And I think it's really cute when a guy sort of calls me on my nervousness and kind of catches me off it.\n\nSomething exactly like that. That was a suave move. Now if the girl isn't chatting a lot, maybe not so much, because maybe she actually wants to tell you something. But if it's a clear ramble, it's a cute romantic move to take initiative and sort of just dominate it. Punctuate it with a nice smooch. So well done to you, sir.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnother thing I like. I like if it's something, I guess clearly the theme is unexpected. A pleasant surprise. Like if you're walking down the street, clearly we are standing and not sitting in a car. But let's say you are walking down the street and we're just enjoying each other in a way that there was no physical contact or pressure preexisting connection. And then I would just sort of just be grabbed and pulled in spontaneously. I don't know how one would manifest that. I mean I'm just walking around enjoying the sunshine and...\n\nYes, sir.\n\nHarrison: Now I have some tips, things that I enjoy very much. I really like when, if I'm being kissed, and it's just a standard issue kiss, if the girl takes the initiative to just go directly from my mouth, maybe not directly, but make her way from my mouth to my ear, and just play with my ear, and just all in that general area. Not inside, that kind of feels like an earwig or some kind of alien.\n\nMaya: Say no more.\n\nHarrison: Wow. \n\nMaya:Was that sort of a ballpark figure?\n\nHarrison: That was quite good. I like when a girl tells me when to kiss them, even if it's out of nowhere. Like if we're just talking.\n\nMaya: I'm taking care of it.\n\nHarrison: And then I'm like, \"So how are you doing?\"\n\nMaya: Just kiss me already dammit. You want to put the knife down first, though. Chop your hand off. What's good about the surprise element that can be interwoven here as a general motif. It eliminates the nervous factor. Because there's not all this anticipation and buildup. One party isn't expecting it, so it's not this coy dance. Just go for the gold.\n\nHarrison: Mm-hm. Exactly. Well said.

Two epigrams by him in the Greek Anthology (Anthol. pal. xiv. 63, xvi. 323) are extant, and a hymn to Nemesis that begins \"Nemesis, winged balancer of life, dark-faced goddess, daughter of Justice\". The hymn is one of four which preserve the ancient musical notation written over the text. Two other hymns, one to the muse Calliope and one entitled Hymn to the Sun, formerly assigned to Dionysius of Alexandria, have also been attributed to Mesomedes. A total of 15 poems by Mesomedes are known.\n\nMesomedes continued in the Musaeum in Alexandria even after Hadrian's death (138); there the Historia Augusta reports that during Antoninus Pius' reign, his state salary was reduced. The emperor Caracalla honored Mesomedes with a cenotaph approximately a hundred years after his death.\n\nPrior to the discovery of the Seikilos epitaph in the late 19th century, the hymns of Mesomedes were the only surviving written music from the ancient world\"\n\nThis arrangement for solo lyre of the Hymn, is also in the wonderfully pure just intonation of antiquity...\n\nFor more of my multitude of \"Musical Adventures in Time Travel\", please visit:\n\nhttp://www.ancientlyre.com\n\nMany thanks for watching!", "title": "Hymn To Nemesis (Mesomedes of Crete, circa 130 CE)", "publishedDate": "2014-05-13T09:21:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "11GKQTEOwS8", "description": "Streamed by TempUser98feea67e627dd48f669a6b44eaaec3 in France.

For forty years, Israel has killed thousands of Palestinians, demolished 12,000 Palestinian homes, arrested 650,000 Palestinians, and uprooted more than a million Palestinian olive trees.\n\nSince 2002, the Apartheid Wall built on occupied Palestinian territory has effectively encircled the Palestinian population, squeezing Palestinians into truncated Bantustans, cementing Israeli expansionism, and forcing thousands Palestinians off of their land. The Wall divides farmers from their land, students from their schools, workers from their jobs, and people from their communities.\n\nDespite the fact that the International Court of Justice ruled it illegal, the Wall now encircles Palestinian towns and cities in the most massive land-grab in forty years. In its recent war against Lebanon, Israel's unilateralism and militarism have been exposed to the world. Israel continues to establish \"facts on the ground\" to maintain strategic control over the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and to annex land and get rid of the non-Jewish indigenous population.\n\nIn Jerusalem and inside Israel, Palestinians face institutionalized discrimination and are denied equality and their full rights as citizens since 1948. And Israel continues to deny Palestinian refugees, who were forcibly exiled from their homeland in the 1947-48 war, their internationally guaranteed rights, including the right to return to one's homeland and the right to property restitution.\n\nOn March 29, 2006, Canada became the first country in the world to impose a siege on the Palestinian people living in the West Bank and Gaza, which meant total political and economic sanctions on the Palestinian Authority -- the largest employer in these occupied Palestinian territories. The stated reason for the siege was the formation of a democratically elected government in uncontested democratic elections. Canada had been one of the states calling for democratic Palestinian elections, but was displeased with the result: the victory of Hamas.\n\nThe siege is the first time in human history that the \"international community\" has decided to punish a people under occupation, let alone punish them for democratically electing their leadership. The siege has had a devastating effect on the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza including:\n\n- Eliminating the salaries, wages and livelihood of one-third of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza;\n\n- Dragging two-thirds of the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza below the poverty line (they live on less than $2 a day). These working people and their families now live in fear of starvation;\n\n- The closure of Palestinians areas: Palestinians were prevented from getting to work, school or hospital outside of their canton (usually their village, town or city) for 86% of the year.\n\nJoin together on June 10 outside the U.S. consulate in Toronto to demand that Canada lift this siege immediately, and end any and all Canadian support for the Israeli Occupation of Palestine.\n\nFor more information, please contact Palestine House:\nE-mail: info@palestinehouse.com\nPhone: 905-270-3622\nWebsite: http://www.palestinehouse.com", "title": "Global Day of Action Against Siege and Occupation Toronto 13", "publishedDate": "2007-06-12T15:51:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "11J677gHipg", "description": "The actor opened up to Ellen about his experience with the legendary comedy star.", "title": "Exclusive!

She then joked about it.\n\n\"Is that somebody throwing something at me? Is that part of Cirque de Soleil?\" Clinton quipped.\n\nMany in the audience of more than 1,000 people in a large ballroom laughed and applauded as Clinton resumed her speech.\n\n\"My goodness, I didn't know that solid waste management was so controversial,\" Clinton said. \"Thank goodness she didn't play softball like I did.\"\n\nBrian Spellacy, U.S. Secret Service supervisory special agent in Las Vegas, said the woman was being questioned and would face criminal charges. Spellacy declined to identify the woman, and he said it wasn't immediately clear what the charges would be.\n\nA black and orange shoe was recovered from the stage, Spellacy said.\n\nIlene Rosen, the wife of a conventioneer from Denver who was seated in the second row, said she saw an orange object fly toward the stage from a side aisle and papers fluttering in the air.\n\nRosen said the woman had walked down the aisle to within six rows of the front of the seating area, threw the items, turned around, put her hands in the air and walked toward the back of the room. Security officers quickly caught up with her.\n\nIn the hotel hallway, the middle-aged blonde woman sat calmly on a sofa, wearing a blue dress and thong sandals. She said she threw a shoe and dropped some papers, but didn't identify herself to reporters or explain the action. Security officials then ushered reporters and photographers away.\n\nSpellacy and Mark Carpenter, spokesman for the recycling institute, said the woman wasn't a credentialed convention member and wasn't supposed to have been in the ballroom.\n\nAfter her speech, Clinton answered questions posed by Jerry Simms, the outgoing chairman of the organization. Simms first offered what he called a \"deepest apology for that crude interruption.\"\n\nClinton answered questions broadly, saying she felt politics today leads people to \"do what they think will be rewarded.\"\n\nAn attendee later handed a reporter a piece of paper that was apparently thrown by the woman. It appeared to be a copy of a Department of Defense document labeled confidential and dated August 1967; it referred to an operation \"Cynthia\" in Bolivia.\n\nThe incident reminded some of former President George W. Bush dodging two shoes thrown by an Iraqi journalist during a news conference in Baghdad in December 2008. Shoe-throwing is considered an insult in Arab cultures.\n\nClinton, the former first lady and Democratic senator from New York, has been traveling the country giving paid speeches to industry organizations and appearing before key Democratic Party constituents.\n\nDuring a speech in San Francisco on Tuesday, Clinton said she was seriously considering a presidential bid and all it would entail.\n\nHillary Clinton Shoe, hillary, clinton, shoe", "title": "Shoe Thrown at Hillary Clinton During Speech", "publishedDate": "2014-04-12T23:11:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "11MegwnzNIM", "description": "D A W N S - 'Taillights' \n\nBuy the song now on Amazon & iTunes!\n\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/EP/dp/B0086MGDFU/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1375647424&sr=301-1\n\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/dawns-ep/id530288610\nvisit www.dawnsiscoming.com and sign up on our mailing list!\n\nFor highest quality viewing, please select 720 or 1080.\n\n'Taillights' is the third video in a four video series from the debut EP by \nD A W N S, produced by Danton Supple (Coldplay, Starsailor, Morrissey).\n\nDirected by Patrick Cook & Mathew Miller\nCinematography by Brandon Woodard \nEdited by Brandon Woodard\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/dawnsiscoming \nwww.twitter.com/dawnsiscoming\nwww.dawnsiscoming.com", "title": "D A W N S - 'Taillights' (Official Video)", "publishedDate": "2012-07-09T15:48:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "11Mglzw9qzk", "description": "https://soundcloud.com/luviansound", "title": "Luvian | Waves", "publishedDate": "2013-02-06T20:04:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "11MuX4K-ttw", "description": "Movember is delivering an everlasting impact on the state of prostate cancer.

The transverse incision is usually an inch or so above the pubic bone. This type of incision is also known as a \"bikini\" incision. This is the most common type of incision used during C-section.\n\nOpen abdominal surgery can be painful, involving heavy pain medications, risk of infection, significant blood loss and increased risk for transfusion. After surgery, a long recovery (often 6 weeks) is usually necessary. In addition, many patients are not happy with the scar left by the incision.\n\nWhile minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy) has been available for two decades now for many routine gynecologic procedures, most complex hysterectomy, myomectomies and sacrocolpopexies are performed using open surgery. This is because conventional laparoscopic technology can't provide surgeons the visualization, precision, dexterity and control required to handle challenges like large uteri, multiple adhesions from prior pelvic surgery. \n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

We show that these are indeed massive sesamoids that employ a patchy mode of ossification of a massive cartilaginous precursor and that the predigits act functionally like digits. Further, we reveal clear osteological correlates of predigit joint articulation with the carpals/tarsals that are visible in fossils. Our survey shows that basal proboscideans were relatively \"flat-footed\" (plantigrade), whereas early elephantiforms evolved the more derived \"tip-toed\" (subunguligrade) morphology, including the predigits and fat pad, of extant elephants. Thus, elephants co-opted sesamoid bones into a role as false digits and used them for support as they changed their foot posture. \n\nSupporting Online Material Video\n\n- Movie S1\nFoot anatomy of an extant elephant (Elephas maximus; specimen #4 in table S1). Manus, then pes anatomy are shown, with bones labeled using terms from (25, 26) (alternative comparative terms in parentheses). \nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/12/21/334.6063.1699.DC1/1211437s1.mov\n\n- Movie S2\nPrehallux mobility in a cadaveric hindfoot. Right pes of specimen #5 in table S1 shown in medial view. Outlines at beginning show rough positions of some anatomical structures (see movie S1); labels: c = centrale; ca = calcaneus, D2 = distal end (ungual/nail) of digit II, mt1,2,3 = metatarsals I-III, ph = prehallux, t1 = tarsal I. Some tissue around the proximal prehallux has been cut and part of the fat pad has been removed around the distal prehallux so overall mobility is exaggerated, but the video is representative of potential caudodorsal mobility of the predigits under loading (fig. 2). \nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/12/21/334.6063.1699.DC1/1211437s2.mov\n\n- Movie S3\nEvolution of manus anatomy in Proboscidea.

In it I forget to mention that the foundations are very deep and there is wire mesh under the substrate in order to prevent rats burrowing up into it. It was built several months ago and William has had a lovely summer playing in it. He still gets to have a supervised roam around the rest of the garden everyday, as it is important to give them a change of scenery even when they have a large enclosure like this. In the wild they would cover large areas everyday.\n\nWilliam also has a tortoise table indoors, which he sleeps in at night and warms up in every morning before going out to play and eat. When he is fully grown I am hoping to create an even bigger area outdoors, attached to a shed where he can sleep. That is a few years off yet so he will be happy as Larry in this large space until then.\n\nSince this video was made we have added a wooden hut and a little cloche type thing. I will put an updated video of his enclosure on youtube in the near future. I will also be uploading a video with tips on diet so check out my channel for that.\n\nAs always, if you want to know more about keeping a tortoise properly then visit the following websites;\n\nwww.tortoisetrust.org\nwww.tortoisetrustforum.org\nwww.thetortoisetable.org.uk\n\nTortoises are wonderful animals so house them well, feed them what they would eat in the wild and give them lots of your time and care.

Concentrate on muscle groups so that you bulge in all the right places.\n\n\nWarning\nAlways consult a physician before attempting any new exercise or exercise plan.\n\nStep 1: Create hourglass shape\nCreate an hourglass shape by doing squats. Stand with your feet 8 to 9 inches apart, extend your arms in front of you, and squat your hips backward. Do four sets of 15 to 20 squats, working several minutes at a time.\n\nTip\nTone your waist and hips using a Hula-hoop for 10 minutes a day. You'll get curves and feel like a kid again.\n\nStep 2: Use dumbbells\nBuild shoulder and back muscles by lifting dumbbells out from your sides for resistance. Lift 10 times each set, four sets a day. The broader your shoulders and outer thighs, the narrower your waist will look.\n\nStep 3: Work abdomen\nWork your abdomen to straighten your posture. Alternate hanging each arm while holding a dumbbell, bending at the waist toward the side with the weight. Hold for five seconds while flexing your knee, and then straighten your body again.\n\nStep 4: Get curves\nConcentrate on your obliques by performing stretches to enhance a large chest and distract from the waist. Emphasizing those upper curves will seem to shrink your midsection.\n\nStep 5: Work your stomach\nCraft a tight belly to improve your silhouette. Sit on a bench and lean back until your abs engage to hold you up. Twist slowly and reach or punch to the right, then the left, stretching and challenging your stomach muscles.\n\nStep 6: Walk to firm\nTake brisk walks to firm your legs and shape your calves and thighs. Stretch before you walk and cool down afterward.\n\nDid You Know?\nIf Barbie stood 5 feet 6 inches tall, she would sport a 20-inch waist.", "title": "How to Get Curves", "publishedDate": "2011-03-28T15:02:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "11vSRKLqBRc", "description": "Conveyancers are property specialists, who handle the legal transfer of property or land.

The results also showed that only one in five Chicago voters believe Emanuel is doing a better job than his predecessor, former Mayor Richard M. Daley.\n\n\"'Right now, Rahm is not connecting,' McKeon said, according to the Sun-Times report. 'If he doesn't do that, he's gonna lose.'\n\nThe poll included 511 registered Chicago voters, who said they were 'very likely' to go to the polls. The city's mayoral election is set to take place on Feb. 24, 2015.\n\nBack in February 2011, Emanuel easily ousted five rivals with 55 percent of the vote, avoiding a runoff by earning the simple majority. By August 2013, a Crain/Ipsos poll showed Emanuel's approval rating had dipped to a point where only two percent of Chicagoans strongly supported his job performance.\"\n\nCenk Uygur of The Young Turks explains why Rahm Emanuel is so deeply unpopular with Chicago voters, and engages in a bit of \"I told you so\" over Emanuel's failed policies and low approval rating.\n\nFor more, read the Huffington Post story by Chris Gentilviso here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/10/rahm-emanuel-poll_n_5301848.html\n\n**********\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

A cold sore can be annoying and painful, but is hardly ever harmful.\n\nThe herpes virus will remain forever in your body though and can get reactivated at a later time. That's why you can get a cold sore over and over again.\n\nThere isn't any treatment to get the virus out of your body. So, what are the do's and don'ts when you've got a cold sore? Don't touch the blisters and wash your hands regularly especially when you've touched the blisters by accident.\n\nA cold sore is extremely contagious. The herpes virus that's inside the blisters can be transmitted through kissing or after you've touched them with your fingers.\n\nThe virus can end up in the eye or near the genitals in that way and blisters may form in those places. Once the blisters have dried up, the virus can't be transmitted any longer.\n\nNever hug a baby when you've got a cold sore. Babies can get seriously ill from the herpes virus and can even die because it. That's the reason why it's also called the \"kiss of death\".\n\nSunlight, a reduced resistance, illness, menstruation, or stress can activate the herpes virus so a cold sore can show up. So avoid being exposed to the sun. and use protective lip balm or sunblock on your lips to protect yourself against the sun.\n\nKeep your resistance up eat healthy food, exercise regularly and get a good night's rest. Some people find comfort in putting the Vaseline or zinc oxide on their lips to ease the itching and pain.\n\nYou could use anti-viral creams and tablets. The cream hasn't been proven to reduce the symptoms of a cold sore though. Tablets could reduce the symptoms of a cold sore but only if you use them in a very early stage before the blisters have formed.\n\nConsult your family doctor when the blisters haven't disappeared after two weeks or when the inflammation spreads. In the last case, bacteria might have gotten into the blisters and caused a new infection. You'll need immediate treatment from your family doctor.\n\nLearn How To Cure Your Cold Sores Easily, Naturally and Permanently Within 3 Days!

Barbra is afraid of cemeteries; Johnny teasingly frightens her repeating the words, \"They're coming to get you, Barbra!\" A pale skinned man (Bill Hinzman) is walking with a limp around the cemetery, and Johnny remarks that he is \"one of them.\" Annoyed by Johnny's childish behavior, Barbra goes to the man to apologize, but he grabs her. Coming to rescue his sister, Johnny wrestles with the man but is killed when he falls headfirst on a tombstone. Barbra flees, with the man in pursuit.\nCrashing her and Johnny's car into a tree, she flees to an empty farmhouse where she discovers the half-eaten corpse of the apparent homeowner. Frantically running out of the house, she notices several more ghoulish figures approaching the vicinity. Suddenly, a man named Ben (Duane Jones) arrives in a pickup truck, drags Barbra back inside the house, and barricades the doors and windows. Barbra frantically insists that they must go and rescue Johnny, before collapsing in apparent shock.\n\n\nThe ghouls swarm around the house, searching for living human flesh.\nMeanwhile, hiding in the cellar are an angry married couple, Harry (Karl Hardman) and Helen Cooper (Marilyn Eastman), their daughter Karen (Kyra Schon), and teenage couple Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). Ben activates a radio while Barbra awakens, believing Tom and Harry to be more of the ghouls when they emerge from the basement. Arguing with each other, Harry wants everyone to hide in the cellar but Ben deems it a \"deathtrap\" and remains upstairs. Tom agrees with Ben and asks for Judy to come upstairs.\nHarry returns to the cellar to Helen and Karen, who has fallen ill after being bitten on the arm by a ghoul. Radio reports explain that an epidemic of mass murder is sweeping across the eastern seaboard. When Ben finds a television, the emergency broadcaster reports that the recently deceased have become reanimated and are consuming the flesh of living people. Experts, scientists, and the United States military do not know the cause, though one scientist believes the cause to be radioactive contamination from a space probe that exploded in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n\nThe Cooper family have been hiding in the cellar beneath the house.\nAfter news reports provide information about local fortifications where people can take refuge, Ben devises a plan to get to the nearest sanctuary, which would provide medical care for Karen, who is barely conscious. Ben suggests they depart in the truck in which he arrived, which is low on fuel. Ben and Tom then drive the short distance to a gas pump while Harry hurls Molotov cocktails from an upper window to keep the ghouls at bay. Fearing for Tom's safety, Judy follows him. They arrive at the pump but Tom accidentally spills fuel, setting the truck ablaze. Tom and Judy attempt to get the truck away from the pump to avoid further damage but it explodes, killing them both.\nBen despondently returns to the house to find Harry retreating to the cellar door, leaving Ben outside to contend with the ghouls. Angered by Harry's heartlessness, Ben kicks the door down and attacks him. Meanwhile, the ghouls approach the truck to feed on Tom and Judy's carcasses. Back in the house, a final report on the television reveals that a gunshot or heavy blow to the head will stop any ghoul and that posses of armed men are patrolling the countryside to restore order.\nAfter the ghouls attempt to break into the house, Harry, in another heartless act, grabs Ben's rifle and threatens to shoot him. Ben wrestles the gun from Harry and shoots him. The ghouls begin to tug Helen and Barbra through the windows. Dying of his wounds, Harry stumbles into the cellar to find that his daughter Karen has died from the infected bite on her arm. Helen manages to free herself from the clutches of the ghouls and goes to the cellar to find a reanimated Karen consuming Harry's flesh. Karen repeatedly and fatally stabs Helen with a cement trowel.\nMeanwhile, Barbra spots a reanimated Johnny among the mob of ghouls; distracted by her brother's presence, she is carried away, never to be seen again. Karen tries to attack Ben, but he pushes her away and seals himself in the cellar\u2014ironically, the very course of action he originally opposed. Ben shoots the reanimated Harry and Helen as they open their eyes.\nThe next morning, Ben, the lone survivor, awakens as a posse arrives. He hears the posse and proceeds to the window, when a member of the posse, mistaking him for a ghoul, fatally shoots him in the head. Ben's body is then placed onto a burning pyre along with other dead bodies.", "title": "Night Of The Living Dead 1968 Trailer", "publishedDate": "2011-07-20T10:49:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "12H_9zI7wUo", "description": "", "title": "Ape Escape 2 - Level 03 Port Calm Time Attack 00'15''3 PAL Version", "publishedDate": "2010-08-01T16:52:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "12I1nlmAjGU", "description": "Things don't quite go to plan when Giles Potter, 16, takes on Jackie Wilson's Reet Petite\n\nVisit the official site: http://itv.com/xfactor\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/TXFSub\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/TXFFB\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/TXFTwi\nDownload The X Factor mobile app: http://bit.ly/TXFapp\nWatch full episodes on ITV Player (UK ONLY): http://www.itv.com/itvplayer", "title": "Giles Potter sings Reet Petite by Jackie Wilson -- Arena Auditions Week 4 -- The X Factor 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-09-22T19:47:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "12ILxGYr7Dc", "description": "Surveillance video shows a man charging at four New York Police officers with a hatchet.

The Craftsman Ratcheting Open End Wrench 4-piece Set boasts Craftsman's patented open-ended ratcheting design on both ends, giving the user two different sized ratcheting wrenches in one tool.\n\nThe Craftsman Universal Ratcheting Wrench combines a universal tooth design that grips six different types of nuts and bolts, including six-point, 12-point, partially-rounded, external TORX, square and spline, and a ratcheting box end -- all in one.\n\nThe ratcheting box end is great to loosen and tighten nuts and bolts in hard to reach places where picking up the wrench to turn the fastener is not an option.\n\nThe user can also flip the wrench around to use a reinforced open end that reduces tip spread under heavy load to prevent rounding the corners of fasteners.\n\nThe grip of the wrench is a thick, rounded beam that is easy to grasp and provides comfort and strength under high torque.\n\nThe matte surface finish provides a non-slip grip for excellent control and high contrast markings, making the size identification easy. The set comes with a reusable caddy, which can be hung on pegboard or tucked neatly away in a tools storage drawer, and weighs 2.5 pounds.\n\nThe Craftsman Universal Ratcheting Wrench 7-piece Set is offered in both inch (#21028) and metric (#21030). SAE wrench sizes include 5/16, 3/8, 7/16, 1/2, 9/16, 11/16 and 5/8 inch. Metric sizes include 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17 millimeter. The Craftsman Universal Ratcheting Wrench 7-piece Set retails for $49.99.\n\nThe Craftsman Ratcheting Open End Wrench 4-piece Set combines the speed of ratcheting with the access of the open end wrench. The ratcheting open end wrench features Craftsman's patented tooth design on each end, allowing the user to turn nuts and bolts without lifting the tool off the fastener, making jobs faster and easier.\n\nThe traditional jaw shape allows the user to turn even the most damaged nuts and bolts, and the jaw tips are great for grabbing hard-to-reach fasteners.\n\nEach wrench features two different sizes of jaw openings, giving the user eight common sized wrenches and the convenience of knowing that the user has the right size for the job. The set comes with a reusable caddy. The Craftsman Ratcheting Open End Wrench 4-piece Set is offered in inch (#21936) or metric(#21937).\n\nSAE set sizes include 5/16 x 3/8, 7/16 x 1/2, 9/16 x 5/8 and 11/16 x \u00be in. Metric set sizes include 8 x 10, 13 x 14, 15 x 16 and 17 x 19 milimeter. The Craftsman Ratcheting Open End\n\nWrench 4-piece Set retails for $24.99.\n\nAll Craftsman hand tools have a lifetime guarantee and are available at Craftsman.com or at Sears stores nationwide.", "title": "Ratcheting Wrenches", "publishedDate": "2010-09-06T10:45:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "12Vog4TZRtE", "description": "iTunes: http://po.st/znQ6n2\nAmazon: http://po.st/iCjHfy\nARE YOU CECILIA'S BIGGEST FAN? ENTER THE WORLDWIDE COMPETITION HERE: http://ceciliabartolionline.com/superfan\n\nCecilia Bartoli returns with a majestic new album of world premiere recordings, hidden treasures of the Mariinsky! \n\nFor the very first time Cecilia Bartoli explores the Baroque musical treasures of Tsarist Russia with music from the court of three 18th century Tsaristas: Anna, Elizabeth and Catherine the Great. With music written by Italian and German composers working for the Russian court, this album sheds new light on an incredible and momentous time for Russia, shaping its politics and culture towards the enlightened West.\n\nMostly sung in Italian, the album also offers the first opportunity to hear Bartoli sing in Russian. The music has been intricately researched by Cecilia herself, unlocking the archives of St Petersburg's Mariinsky Library to uncover music lost for over 200 years. The new recording reunites Bartoli with Baroque specialists Diego Fasolis & I Barrochisti.\n\nPre-order the album on iTunes and you will instantly receive the track \nO placido il mare from Siroe, re di Persia by Hermann Raupach.", "title": "Cecilia Bartoli: St Petersburg - The Recording Session!", "publishedDate": "2014-08-28T09:23:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "12Vx6hP-ZiE", "description": "Decided to take a stroll down to the Cars and Coffee meet last Sunday and wanted to make a little edit of some of the cars that I saw there.

I don't really know if high frequency sound is the answer to the problem, but some people are experimenting. The most promising type of speaker for creating (reproducing) high frequency sound is the piezoelectric tweeter. This tweeter uses a crystal to make sound. The sound must be fed to the tweeter from an amplifier or a solid state driver device of some sort. I like the idea of 22,000 cycles (just above human hearing, but within dog hearing range). Keep in mind that piezo tweeters have a resonant frequency which is the frequency at which that particular tweeter is most efficient and most powerful. Each brand and model of piezo tweeter will have different resonant frequencies, so look for the spec graph for that tweeter model. So, I suggest you experiment using a frequecy that the tweeter is most efficient at. You'll see a video that I've made that shows you a flame test for checking to see if there's output from the tweeter. Remember, you cannot hear sine waves at ultrasonic frequencies. You only want to use waveforms and frequencies that cannot be heard by humans. I've learned that there are aggressive and even dangerous people out there who will not like you sending irritating sound toward them or their dog. Just yesterday I got a post (I deleted it) from a guy in which he said he would kill someone if they sent sounds toward his dog. It's ok for him to make sound, but don't you do it. These types of people could care less about you. They've already proven that they don't care about others by allowing their dogs to bark constantly. Again, some people are dangerous, seriously (you watch the news, you know how many dangerous folks are out there), so be careful.\n+++\nI became interested in making these videos because I live in Sugar Land Texas and my yard is bordered by 9 dogs (among 3 neighbors). One of those neighbors is smart and keeps their dogs quiet, the other two neighbors are finally getting better, but they have lapses and they do not like it when I yell at them about their dogs. I've listened to this problem for the better part of ELEVEN years. Is it any wonder that I got tired of it and started yelling? In this town I pay really high taxes to live in a really small house, but I gave up on the cops years ago. They don't give a crap. City council, well, who's that? They're non-existent as far as this citizen can see. Animal control? Yea, right. I'm on my own. I'm now researching solutions and asking viewers out there for ideas, or just comments.\n+++\nI live in a country where, at least, we have theoretical free speech.

Antonin Scalia knew only success in the first fifty years of his life. His sterling academic and legal credentials led to his nomination by President Ronald Reagan to the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in 1982. In four short years there, he successfully outmaneuvered the more senior Robert Bork to be appointed to the Supreme Court in 1986. Scalia s evident legal brilliance and personal magnetism led everyone to predict he would unite a new conservative majority under Chief Justice William Rehnquist and change American law in the process. Instead he became a Court of One. Rather than bringing the conservatives together, Scalia drove them apart. He attacked and alienated his more moderate colleagues Sandra Day O Connor, then David Souter, and finally Anthony Kennedy. Scalia prevented the conservative majority from coalescing for nearly two decades. Scalia: A Court of One is the compelling story of one of the most polarizing figures ever to serve on the nation s highest court. It provides an insightful analysis of Scalia s role on a Court that, like him, has moved well to the political right, losing public support and ignoring public criticism. To the delight of his substantial conservative following, Scalia s originalism theory has become the litmus test for analyzing, if not always deciding, cases. But Bruce Allen Murphy shows that Scalia s judicial conservatism is informed as much by his highly traditional Catholicism, mixed with his political partisanship, as by his reading of the Constitution. Murphy also brilliantly analyzes Scalia s role in major court decisions since the mid-1980s and scrutinizes the ethical controversies that have dogged Scalia in recent years. A Court of One is a fascinating examination of one outspoken justice s decision not to play internal Court politics, leaving him frequently in dissent, but instead to play for history, seeking to etch his originalism philosophy into American law.\n\n\"", "title": "[FREE PDF] Scalia: A Court of One by Bruce Allen Murphy", "publishedDate": "2014-07-09T22:38:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "12tG4uMEYLE", "description": "This morning's clear skies brought schools of menhaden to Sippican Harbor and boats of fishermen harvesting them for bait.", "title": "Menhaden Arrive in Sippican Harbor on Buzzards Bay", "publishedDate": "2008-10-03T01:15:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "12tGtMA4tqk", "description": "The national anthem of the Republic of Kazakhstan, official since January 7, 2006. \n\nLyrics:\n\nAlt\u0131n k\u00fcn aspan\u0131,\nAlt\u0131n d\u00e4n dalas\u0131,\nErlikti\u00f1 dastan\u0131 -\nElime qara\u015f\u0131!\nEjelden er degen,\nDa\u00f1q\u0131m\u0131z \u015f\u0131qt\u0131 \u011foy,\nNam\u0131s\u0131n bermegen,\nQaza\u011f\u0131m m\u0131qt\u0131 \u011foy!\n\nChorus:\nMeni\u00f1 elim, meni\u00f1 elim,\nG\u00fcli\u00f1 bol\u0131p egilemin,\nJ\u0131r\u0131\u00f1 bol\u0131p tegilemin, elim!\nT\u00fc\u011fan jerim meni\u00f1 - Qazaqstan\u0131m!\n\nUrpaqqa jol a\u015fqan,\nKe\u00f1 baytaq jerim bar.\nBirligi jarasqan,\nT\u00e4welsiz elim bar.\nQars\u0131 al\u011fan waq\u0131tt\u0131,\nM\u00e4\u00f1gilik dos\u0131nday.\nBizdi\u00f1 el baq\u0131tt\u0131,\nBizdi\u00f1 el os\u0131nday! \nChorus x2\n\nTranslation:\n\nSky of golden sun,\nSteppe of golden seed,\nLegend of courage -\nTake a look at my country!\n\nFrom the antiquity\nOur heroic glory emerged,\nThey did not give up their pride\nMy Kazakh people are strong!\n\nChorus:\nMy country, my country,\nAs your flower I will be planted,\nAs your song I will stream, my country!\nMy native land   My Kazakhstan!\n\nThe way was opened to the posterity\nI have a vast land.\nIts unity is proper,\nI have an independent country.\n\nIt welcomed the time\nLike an eternal friend,\nOur country is happy,\nSuch is our country.\nChorus x2", "title": "National anthem of Kazakhstan", "publishedDate": "2007-01-31T17:32:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "12tiqelzPdE", "description": "Please support our latest project, Target Acquired! \n\nCheck out our Kickstarter page (draft) and please leave us some feedback:\nhttp://bit.ly/kstouch", "title": "[PREVIEW] Target Acquired - Kickstarter", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T11:28:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "12u4OZAhHpc", "description": "Street Life No Life - MixTape Lev 2013\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/b8lybue3okcx8s4\n\nLev G.U.N.S Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LevGunsOficial\n\n\n\n\nNOVIDADES:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Lisboa2222\n\nhttp://www.gangdomoinho.net/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RapLisboa2222", "title": "Lev ft.

See how party planning pro Betsy Pruitt wraps in gift bags with tissue paper that stays crisp and beautiful.\n\nFirst, stack two pieces of tissue paper, patterned side down, in the shape of a plus sign.  Then place your gift on its side in the center of the tissue paper.  The bottom of your gift should be approximately in the center with the top of your gift toward the corners of the tissue paper.  Fold the tissue paper up around the sides of your gift, touching and squishing the paper as little as possible to minimize wrinkles.  Gently side the gift into your gift bag.  Tap the gift bag on your table a few times to get the gift to slide all the way into the bag.  Fluff up the tissue paper by pulling the corners upwards.  If you need a little extra tissue paper to hide your gift inside the bag, grab the center of a piece of tissue paper, patterned side up, and with a flick of your wrist, gather the tissue into a cluster with the points facing up.  Slide this gently into the center of your gift bag and fluff if needed.  That's all it takes to beautifully wrap a gift inside a gift bag with tissue paper.

It will take a bit of practice to get the blade depth correct; you can see the arse of the machine lift here at one point when I drove down too far. Shows how powerful the hydraulics are and how strong the 3 point hitch is. This tractor weighs over a 1,000lbs with the wheel weights in place as shown in the video. On solid ground pushing the blade all the way down will raise both rear wheels six inches off the surface.\n\nNext year, we will space the rows at a distance from one another that allows the use of the 16 disk harrow that came with the machine. That will make hilling and weeding a breeze.\n\nIt would have taken 45 minutes to turn this bed by hand, and, many of the spuds would have been damaged by the prongs of the fork. You can see some of the tubers fall right into the  trough behind the mould board.

Aschenborn, sur une musique de Robert G\u00f6tz. Il c\u00e9l\u00e8bre l'\u00e9pop\u00e9e coloniale du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Paul Emil Lettow-Vorbeck.\n\nCet officier venait de prendre le commandement des forces allemandes d'Afrique de l'Est (200 officiers et quelques compagnies d'askaris) lorsque la premi\u00e8re guerre mondiale \u00e9clate. Elle lui donnera l'occasion d'\u00e9crire une des plus belles pages de l'histoire militaire. Son premier fait d'arme sera la d\u00e9fense de la ville de Tanga : attaque par les 8000 indiens du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Arthur Aitken, il les tient en \u00e9chec avec son petit millier de soldats avant de les repousser \u00e0 la mer. Son but est d\u00e9sormais simple : r\u00e9sister le plus efficacement possible pour d\u00e9tourner le plus d'hommes possible du front prioritaire, le front europ\u00e9en, o\u00f9 se d\u00e9cidera la victoire finale.\n\n\u00c0 la bataille de Jassin, le 18 janvier 1915, il \u00e9crase de nouveau les Britanniques. Il m\u00e8ne alors une gu\u00e9rilla sans r\u00e9pit, s'introduit au c\u0153ur des provinces britanniques (Kenya et Rhod\u00e9sie). Il l\u00e8ve une arm\u00e9e de 12000 Africains encadr\u00e9s par quelques europ\u00e9ens. Ces troupes sont les fameux Askaris de la chanson ; ces soldats lui seront loyaux jusqu'au bout, lui, l'officier europ\u00e9en qui s'adresse \u00e0 eux dans leur propre langue.\n\n\u00c0 partir de mars 1916, Britanniques et Sud-Africains d\u00e9cident d'en finir et l'attaquent avec plus de 45000 hommes. En excellent strat\u00e8ge, il \u00e9vite le combat quand il le sait perdu et attaque quand il l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9. Malgre son inf\u00e9riorit\u00e9 num\u00e9rique croissante, il remporte \u00e0 nouveau une grande victoire \u00e0 Mahiwa en octobre 1917. Apr\u00e8s 5 jours de combat, il perd 96 hommes. Les Britanniques en comptent 3000 dans leurs rangs.\n\nLes combats se poursuivent au Mozambique puis au Tanganyika puis \u00e0 nouveau en Rhodesie. Il remporte son ultime victoire en prenant la ville de Kasama, le 13 novembre 1918. La guerre est d\u00e9sormais finie. Lettow-Vorbeck se rend \u00e0 la t\u00eate d'une arm\u00e9e invaincue. Nationaliste, on le retrouve apr\u00e8s-guerre \u00e0 la tete d'un corps franc pour \u00e9craser une s\u00e9dition communiste (avec le soutien de la Brigade de Hermann-Ehrardt) ; il participe au coup d'\u00c9tat de Kapp puis devient d\u00e9put\u00e9 nationaliste.\n\nIl int\u00e9grera le minist\u00e8re des Affaires Etrang\u00e8res sous le IIIe Reich, bien que n'ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 national-socialiste. Il est r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 en 1938 dans la Wehrmacht comme g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Sans retraite apr\u00e8s 1945, il devient jardinier et publie des livres. Son ancien ennemi anglais, le mar\u00e9chal Jan Smith, organise une souscription \u00e0 son profit. Lors de ses obs\u00e8ques, quelques askaris survivants vinrent lui rendre un dernier hommage, en souvenir de cet officier colonial appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 de tous, tant par ses officiers que par ses soldats ou ses ennemis.\n\nIl s'agit du chant pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 du mar\u00e9chal Erwin Rommel, dont l'\u00e9pop\u00e9e africaine, \u00e0 la t\u00eate de l'afrika Korps, est \u00e9galement entr\u00e9e dans la l\u00e9gende.

They are elongated metameric creatures with one pair of legs per body segment. Despite the name, centipedes can have a varying number of legs from under 20 to over 300. Centipedes have an odd number of pairs of legs (with one exception[1]), e.g. 15 or 17 pairs of legs (30 or 34 legs).[2][3] There are no centipedes with exactly 100 legs. A key trait uniting this group is a pair of venom claws or forcipules formed from a modified first appendage. Centipedes are a predominantly carnivorous taxon.[4]:168\n\nCentipedes normally have a drab coloration combining shades of brown and red. Cavernicolous (cave-dwelling) and subterranean species may lack pigmentation and many tropical scolopendromorphs have bright aposematic colours. Size can range from a few millimetres in the smaller lithobiomorphs and geophilomorphs to about 30 cm (12 in) in the largest scolopendromorphs.

Unlike other instruments, it produces waves of unpredictable combination tones when played that distract our pattern-seeking mind. A healing space opens up beyond the minds limitations in which all manner of visionary experience, clearing of imbedded emotions, and connection with deep relaxation and peace can manifest. \nThe sound of the gong creates deep relaxation, freeing us from the flood of thoughts our mind releases, and stimulates the glandular system to a higher level of functioning. \nDuring the gong meditation emotional transformation is produced as it reduces tension, releases blocks and stimulates circulation. The result is a reorganization of the emotional energy and feelings that are tied into the body structure. The gong changes feelings that are blocked by cutting the thoughts that sustain and recreate the feelings. \n\nThe gong meditation clears the nerve endings and regenerates the parasympathetic system which is ruled by sound. The parasympathetic system sends \"relax\" messages to all the organs. It regulates the rebuilding functions of the body and it is vital for handling stress since it coordinates the recovery period from stress. To regenerate the parasympathetic system, nothing is more powerful than the gong.", "title": "1 Gong Bath - a deep meditation into self: introduction", "publishedDate": "2009-11-25T15:39:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "13Obp_DHfQw", "description": "A few friends at the lake trying to fish without much luck!", "title": "Fishing at Buffalo Lake", "publishedDate": "2010-09-07T03:39:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "13OfAD407rY", "description": "58015 2.4G 4CH Single-Propeller RC Helicopter", "title": "58015 2.4G 4CH Single-Propeller RC Helicopter", "publishedDate": "2012-10-31T20:52:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "13P9OhamuPk", "description": "I.Qba - Farkas Hanna\nII.

I had another failed ignition of this same batch about a week ago. It turns out that the thermite brick has to be almost completely dry after casting before you can ignite it. The original weight of the dry ingredients was precisely 66 grams. After addition of water, the mixture was left to set until hard (takes an hour or two). The thermite brick was removed from the mould and the weight was measured to be 90.5 grams, which further decreased to 88 grams as the water started to evaporate. This is when the ignition failed. The Iron oxide thermite that I was using for ignition actually worked, but failed to ignite the brick. No significant loss of weight was observed after this, meaning none of the mixture had ignited. The brick was left in the sun for two days in temperatures of about 30C. The weight decreased to 67 grams, meaning it was almost completely dry. Second ignition mixture consisted of some of the left over dry ingredients mixed with black powder. This mixture was combined with methylated spirits and ground to a homogeneous consistency. The ethanol was evaporated off and the resulting mixture was ground further to a flour-fine powder. This mixture was extremely successful in igniting the dried out thermite brick, setting it aflame with ease.\n\nThe target to be melted was some stainless steel casing from an old Sunbeam toaster whose timer board burnt out. The plaster thermite melted through it easily, but was perhaps not as effective as Iron thermite. Keep in mind that this was only 66 grams of composition; the same amount of Iron thermite probably wouldn't be as effective.\n\nThe plaster thermite brick burned extremely brightly, lighting up the surroundings (I estimate) as effectively as a 500 watt floodlight. Unfortunately the end product, Calcium sulfide (in a conglomerate with Aluminium oxide) reacts with atmospheric water vapour, producing a nasty Hydrogen sulfide smell. The colour of the flame was bright orange, as expected from Calcium's emission spectrum.\n\nThe reaction ended, leaving a brightly incandescent puddle of molten steel and reaction products.\n\nAlso I fixed the Aspect Ratio on my camera, removing most of those annoying black borders.\n\nIf you're watching my videos you might know that chemistry and electricity are quite expensive hobbies.

The Army took those Soldier suggestions and developed a possible replacement uniform. Now Soldiers can vote on which one of those they think looks the best.\n\nMore than 76,000 Soldiers responded to the initial survey. Among other things, Soldiers commented about uniform fit, moisture wicking and anti-microbial properties and how much the uniform weighs. The Army listened to Soldiers and has developed a new Improved Physical Fitness Uniform, or IPFU.\n\nNow the Army wants Soldiers to weigh in on color options and graphic patterns for the uniform. There are six candidate uniforms -- they are all the same in terms of fabrics, capabilities and durability. What's different is the color of the fabrics and the size, color and shapes of the graphic designs.\n\nAll Soldiers have the option to log on and choose which uniform option they like best. The poll goes live beginning Oct. 9, and will be available for 20 days.\n\nStylistic variations include different colors for the jacket and pants -- black or gray, for instance. Soldiers can also choose among graphic elements and colors for graphic elements.\n\nWith the jacket, for instance, there is a chevron emblazoned across the chest. That can be in yellow, grey or black, and it can be thick or thin. On the shorts, there's the option to have colored piping on the sides. For the long and short-sleeve T-shirts, there's both fabric color options and the option to have either the word \"Army\" emblazoned across the chest or the Army logo over the left breast.\n\nSoldiers will have 20 days to make it known which they think looks best.\n\nPerhaps more important than how the uniform looks is how the uniform will perform and feel. Improvements in the IPFU include reduced fabric weight, tagless labels, anti-microbial properties, quick-dry capability, removal of reflective properties in the uniform, the removal of the liner and elastic bottom on the pants, and overall pattern adjustments to provide a better fit.\n\nPEO Soldier will travel around the Army to show off to Soldiers the new uniform options. The dates and locations include Fort Bragg, N.C, Oct. 8-10 ; Fort Hood, Texas, Oct. 11-15; Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash., Oct. 16-18; and Fort Shafter and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, Oct. 19-26. Locations for those demonstrations were chosen for density of Soldiers.\n\nAfter Soldiers vote on which uniform they like best, there will be a \"series of steps\" that must take place before the uniforms reach Soldiers. Included in those steps are wear testing by a sample group of Soldiers, additional improvements as a result of that testing, and a final approval by the chief of staff of the Army.\n\n********VOTING LINKS*********\n* To vote without a CAC\nhttps://surveys.natick.army.mil/Surveys/ipfu.nsf\n\n* To vote with a CAC\n https://ipfusurvey.natick.army.mil/", "title": "US Army Wants You to Vote on New PT Uniform", "publishedDate": "2012-10-10T03:14:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "13nwv62Aqfo", "description": "This is the new single, Canvas Apparatus, here the Lyrics be\n\nWhat a trip, to the moon of an eclipse\nResist the abyss of the darkness within\nA thought appeal repel, rebel\nExcell the intell which compels and dispels\nExpell The tale that Scuicide \nis not sacrificially taking your life\nNegatively if you left their side\nBut beneficially if you stayed alive\nLove, Hate, Betrayle, Saddness\nThrough it all,we will face this madness \nStand in the way of these metal assassins \nRhyme passes, hatred crashes \nA thought some ponder, \nLonger and Longer\nBroader Stronger\nHuman beings, Losing Grief \nPutting an end to crude beliefs \n\nBounce rebound\nBound to sounds\nProfoundness found\nOutstanding life that\nSent you on a mind trip\nForbidden to give in \nOr wear thin\nThese visions imprinted\nRefuse to be hidden. \n\n2nd Verse:\n\nChosen, Engrossed in the moment\nForming the notions that hope is enormous \nTill corrosion is dormant\nDistortion aborted\nGrow in these cloven emotions\nMorals are broken, and thrown into orbit\nBut we know, that no one will know this\nSo motives awoken and storm into motion\nArtist, lost in the process, of stopping the nonsense \nWhich started the heartless\nOur cause is\nMarching upon this till darkness abolished \nWhich has robbed us and starved us \nAnd crossed in with lostness\nAnd locked in our thoughts man\nMy thesis, to peace and defeating this\nIs leaving the things that keep\nSteepening our weaknesses\nTruth is, music will swoop in\nremoving confusion \nRemoving the ruines\nExcluding the movements\nThat has sought us and fought us and rot us\nBut never caught us or stopped us or paused us\nDefense is imbedded and sent in\nThis dimension, Forming peace\nAs the poetry, grows and breaths \n\nend: Splattering the passion upon the canvas apparatus", "title": "Music and Stuff.

She used to come in a wheelchair and just do upper body exercise, the sweet smile on her face, masking her unshakeable determination to lose weight and get out of the wheelchair.\n\nNow she walks through the door, beaming \u2014 with the aid of crutches \u2014 and the other day I saw her doing 40kg dead lifts with no support at all.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe this sparkly 57-year-old was once bedridden, morbidly obese and so full of self-loathing, she didn\u2019t want to live.\n\n\u201cI was 224kg and so overweight I couldn\u2019t fit in the shower. My 14 and 15-year-old daughters used to carry me outside and hose me down every night, summer and winter.\n\n\u201cI had a huge apron of fat I had to lift up so they could hose under it. I was very particular about my hygiene,\u201d she says.\n\nSass was bedridden for two and a half years and then in a wheelchair for nine years as a result of an accident which caused thoracic and sciatic damage. Her specialist told her she would never walk again.\n\n\u201cI believed him, and plunged into a state of dark depression. I had to say goodbye to participating in my children\u2019s sports and education, ensuring they got all the things I never had. My daughters, Shekinah and Henipeepi were training for the world waka ama champs coached by Kiwi Campbell at the time, and I used to help out. It was devastating having to give it all up.\u201d\n\nSass was turned down for home help so Shekinah and Henipeepi became her caregivers.\n\n\u201cThey fed me generous portions as it was my only pleasure and it stopped me writhing in pain from nerve damage.\n\n\u201cAs I lay in bed, the weight started to pile on and I lost all sense of pride and dignity.\u201d\n\nThe strong and active mother of six who had coped with her husband\u2019s death from cancer in March 1996, admits she descended into self-pity.\n\n\u201cI had no purpose in life, I was tired of the pain, tired of being tired, tired of living . . . and I didn\u2019t want to be a burden on my family.\n\n\u201cThe turning point came when I was at a particularly low ebb. Henipeepi asked me: \u2018Mum, don\u2019t you want to see your grandchildren?\u2019 \u201cShe was 19 and afraid to tell me she was pregnant. My children had lost their father and were frightened of losing their mother too.\n\n\u201cThat moment changed my life, immediately and completely. Henipeepi gave me a reason to live and a purpose in life again.\u201d\n\nSass delivered the baby herself at Gisborne Hospital, \u201can amazing, life-changing experience\u201d.\n\n\u201cI brought Shekhan into the world . . . from my wheelchair. Needless to say I have a very special bond with her.\n\n\u201cI had the privilege of caring for her and I bathed her every day for a month. She is the most precious gift.\n\n\u201cMy little ray of hope is now six years old. Shekhan made my life worth living again. She made me want to change and gave me the will to do it.\u201d\n\nIn May 2012, Sass began attending Zumba classes at Gisborne Fitness, doing upper body exercise from her wheelchair, and also working with personal trainers at the YMCA.\n\nWith a new regime of clean healthy eating and regular exercise, she managed to shed a whopping 110kg in 22 months.\n\nShe was such a star at Zumba, she was flown to Orlando, Florida in August last year to receive an inspirational award from Zumba founder Beto Perez and events co-ordinator David Topel.\n\nSass spoke onstage from her wheelchair to an audience of 8000 and was interviewed on TV and radio by journalists from all over the world. By then she weighed 114kg.\n\nFilmed and Edited by\nBen Cowper\nhttp://www.gisborneherald.co.nz\n#GigaTownGisborne", "title": "Sass Mahuika - bedridden to body builder", "publishedDate": "2014-08-11T00:17:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "13rj9vFz7tg", "description": "Diego Costa vs Howard  en el chelsea vs everton 30/08/14", "title": "Diego Costa vs Tim Howard", "publishedDate": "2014-08-30T19:44:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "13s9vzXMbks", "description": "Ellen Page has the best Canadian Thanksgiving ever!\n\nDirected by\nRYAN RICKETT\n\nWritten by\nJOHN RINGHOFF\n\nStory by\nELLEN PAGE\nand SEAN TILLMANN\n\nStarring\nELLEN PAGE\nHAR MAR SUPERSTAR\nKATHRYN AAGESEN\nand JUSTIN LONG\n\n!!!

Just one of hundreds of recipes available for mobile phone.\n \nIngredients:\nTurbot (Fish) - You could also use salmon, sole or halibut\nGround Pepper\nChanterelle Mushrooms\nOnions\nLeeks\nSalt\nFish Stock\nButter\nCream\nBottle of Champagne - Brutt or a dry white wine\n \nDirections:\n \nChop the mushrooms\nChop the Onions\n \nAdd a little butter to a hot pan to melt\n \nWhen it is fully melted, add the chopped onions and then chopped mushrooms\n \nAdd the Champagne and a little more once the froth has died down.\n \nThen add the fish stock\n \nThen add the fresh cream\n \nSeason the mixture with a little salt and freshly ground pepper.\n \nAgitate the pan to mix the ingredients, which are then poured into a sieve.\n \nThe solid ingredients are pushed into the sieve to make sure all of the sauce is extracted.\n \nNow prepare the fish.\n \nA medium size Turbot is ideal.\n \nTwo leeks are sliced lengthways and then chopped finely.\n \nA Turbot Filet is placed on a flat surface and the skin is removed with a sharp knife and then trimmed for presentation.\n \nThen it is cut into three pieces of equal size.  \n \nThe chopped leeks are added to a saucepan of boiling water\n \nThe Filets of Turbot are placed in a frying pan to cook in a little oil and seasoned with a little fresh pepper.\n \nThe cooked leaks are removed from the saucepan and put in a bowl of iced water to cool.\n \nThe filets are turned to be browned on the other side.  More pepper is added and then some butter to add flavor.\n \nThe fillets are left to fry for a moment longer.\n \nNow the cooled leeks are added to a frying pan with some butter.  They are shaken a little and some salt and pepper is added.  \n \nOnce they are fried and nicely softened, the leeks are spooned out onto a plate.  The Turbot fillets are removed from the frying pan, any excess oil is shaken off.  The fillets are placed on the plate with the leeks.\n \nFinally, the sauce is spooned over the fish in a decorative manner and it is garnished with two crayfish.\n\nAs this is a light-bodied fish like sole, it is best served with a light-bodied white wine like Pinot Grigio White wine as well as a Burgundy, Chablis, lightly oaked or un-oaked Chardonnays.\n\nAbout Champagne:\nHow are Sparkling Wines Classified? \n\nSparkling wines and Champagnes are categorized as Extra Brut, Brut (pronounced \"broot\"), Extra dry, Sec and Demi-sec depending on their sugar levels. These classifications can be somewhat confusing, but keep in mind, that in wine terms \"dry\" is the opposite of \"sweet.\" \n\nExtra Brut - is \"extra\" dry \n\nBrut -- dry (most popular style and very food-friendly) \n\nExtra dry -- middle of the road dry, not as dry as Brut (great as an aperitif) \n\nDemi-sec -- pretty sweet (pair with fruit and dessert) \n\n\nChampagne and sparkling wines are also categorized as \"vintage\" or \"non-vintage\" (NV on the label) meaning they either come from a single year or are a blend of several different years. The \"vintage\" Champagnes are typically pricier, as the non-vintage Champagne and sparkling wines make up the majority of the market. \n\nIf you'd like to see a \"live\" video demo of serving sparklers click here. \n\nChampagne/Sparkling Wine Suggestions Priced from $10-30: \n\nMumm Napa Brut $24\nSegura Viudas $12\nFreixenet $12\nKorbel Champagne Brut \nBeringer Sparkling White Zinfandel $10\nJacob's Creek Sparkling Ros\u00e9 $12 \nChandon Extra Dry Riche $12\nBlanquette de Limoux Cuvee Jean Philippe 2002 $13 \nMoscato d'Asti Bruno Ceretto $16\nBillecart-Salmon Brut R\u00e9serve $16\nDomaine Carneros Brut Carneros $25\nMontaudon Brut NV $30\n\nChampagne Suggestons Priced from $30-50: \n\n\nMumm Cuvee Napa Bubbly \nMoet & Chandon \nPommery Champagne\nLaurent Perrier Champagne \n\nChampagne Suggestons Priced from $50-100: \n\nVeuve Clicquot \nLaurent Perrier NV \nBollinger Grande Annee \n\nChampagne Suggestons Priced from $100+:\n\nMoet & Chandon, Dom Perignon \nTaittinger \nKrug \nPerrier-Jouet Bubbly", "title": "Flavors of France Mobile Phone Sample Turbot in Champagne", "publishedDate": "2009-01-08T22:16:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "13xC1SBWou4", "description": "Tom Crean - Traditionalism Seven solo guitar\n\nSolo composition written December 2010.

They toured extensively across America and even had a song by the Butthole Surfers named in their honor. Their musically \"dirty\" sound was a forerunner for the later grunge bands to come out of Seattle.\nFronted by the enigmatic vocalist John Bigley, the U-Men (whose members also included Tom Price, Charlie \"Chaz\" Ryan, Robin Buchan, Jim Tillman, Tom Hazelmyer and later Tony \"Tone Deaf\" Ransom) pioneered their own unique brand of alternative rock which could best be described as \"swamp-o'-billy\". Together with Northwest contemporaries Girl Trouble (a force of garage \"hipness\" in their own right), the U-Men emerged to fill the void left some 16 years previous with the disappearance of Northwest garage rock legends The Sonics, The Wailers, and The Ventures. They updated this traditional Northwest sound with more modern punk rock and post-punk influences most notably The Cramps and Nick Cave's original group The Birthday Party.\n\nLargely through word of mouth, rumor, showmanship and the occasional alcohol inspired dust up, the U-Men quickly acquired a dedicated cult following and well deserved reputation for mayhem, both on and off the stage. Perhaps their most legendary antic was when Bigley set the front of the Seattle Center Mural Amphitheater stage on fire during a Bumbershoot festival performance, and the band played on.\n\nThe U-Men were managed at different times by Susan Silver (who later went on to marry Chris Cornell and manage Soundgarden, Screaming Trees and Alice in Chains), Bruce Pavitt (co-owner of Bombshelter Records, pre-dating his Sub Pop Records foray into vinyl), and Seattle's legendary punk art gallery tastemaker, Larry Reid.\n\nThrough it all, the U-Men managed to survive largely intact (the exception being bass players) until early 1989 when the core of the group (John, Charlie, and Tom) decided that the experiment had run its course.\n\nTom Price moved on to form Gas Huffer, and also play in supergroup The Monkeywrench, while John and Charlie would co-found The Crows. Jim Tillman, whose work with the band included the self-titled e.p. \"The U-Men\" (1984), the indie classic \"Stop Spinning\" (1985), and the \"Deep Six\" compilation (1986) track \"They\" resurfaced to play bass for various other local bands most notably Love Battery. Tom Hazelmyer who had briefly considered the idea of relocating to Seattle join the band in Tillman's absence, chose instead to remain in his hometown of Minneapolis (performing live just once with the band when they opened for Big Black at the Showbox Theater in March of 1987) to promote his record company (Amphetamine Reptile Records) and band, Halo of Flies. The last member of the group, 19 year old Tony \"Tone Deaf\" Ransom, who in his short stint with the band managed to appear on the single \"Freezebomb\"/\"That's Wild About Jack\" (1987), the album \"Step On A Bug\" (1988), and the \"Dope,Guns,and Fucking In The Streets Vol. 1\" compilation track \"Bad Little Woman\" (1988), would disappear from the local music scene entirely, relocating to (as speculation would have it) Anchorage, Alaska.", "title": "The U-Men - Blight", "publishedDate": "2009-11-22T06:44:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "13zzWf6XVq4", "description": "Kool A.D. - La Pi\u00f1ata", "title": "Kool A.D. - La Pi\u00f1ata", "publishedDate": "2012-04-29T04:20:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "13zzwDAVUgo", "description": "Sebastopol geese family and youngsters enjoying pond for first time", "title": "Sebastopol geese", "publishedDate": "2013-05-29T00:26:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "14-Js7QA0TU", "description": "ORAL, HERBAL, ANTIVENIN, SAFE FOR SNAKEBITE CASES", "title": "PINAK THE ORAL ANTIVENIN II", "publishedDate": "2007-09-24T15:31:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "14-sCPetUMc", "description": "The last of my 5-senses songs- The sense of taste!

Today in this modern era, many youngsters are aspiring with enthusiastic spirit who is coming across with a highly motivating plans and programs. Following the same path, we \"Positive Attitude\" this time is moving on the same direction with full conviction.\n\nPOSITUDE WITH A SOCIAL CAUSE:\nPositude apart from conducting events would also be focusing on social awareness issues. In the present event \"Miss Sikkim Diva\" the team has chosen to focus on the old age home, Old Age Home, Jalipool. Being born in this rich cultural valley, where family  and traditions form the basis of life, the concept of the old age home quite alien. Sadly, we see that a trend has been followed by so called modern society of abandoning old  aged parents in the hands of complete strangers, when they are in need of love and care the most. Along with this beauty contest, we are making an effort to remind our fellow beings that we need to reciprocate  the love that molded us into who we are today.\nIn the future, Positude plans to take up the responsibility of educating a child till his/her higher education, who would be selected from an orphanage. The selection of a needy child will be on the basis of certain criteria and provide the child a chance to have a better future. We would be monitoring his/her educational progress periodically.

Lail\nMusic:Mir Sahib\nMain Cast:Surendra, Noorjahan,Ulhas\nGenre:Social\nBanner:Bombay Cinetone\nRelease:1944\n\nIndia ia aptly described as a land rich in romance, chivalry, and historical importance. . While the beautiful Tajmahal at Agra, the sombre Kutubminar in Delhi, the megnificent Palace of Lakshmi Bai at Jhansi, and the majestio Budhist Temple at Bodh. Gaya, are a living testimony to the past grandeur and glory of India, there are other places epually interesing which etill remain unexplored. Lal Haveli is one of those historical buildings which was presanted to a remote ancestor of the present owner, Thakur, by the emperor Humayun in grateful appreciation of his invaluable help in the battle of Chitor. . The dilapidated Lal Haveli still stands in all its neglected splendour and the impoverished Thakur makes much of his proud possession. To Thakur, Lal Haveli is eynonymous with the nobility and honour of the house; and no wonder the jealously guards it against pollution. Thakur however, ccan scaroely forget the infamy that has been brought upon the house by the elopement of his very beautiful sister, Lalkunwar, with a common soldier. It is thus found that Lal Haveli, too, has had its share of romance. . Thakurs greatest attraction and resonsibility in life centres round his beloved little daughter Mukta who is very friendly with one Anand living next door. This young boy Anand is also very proud of his late father and his soldierly achievements. The old gun belonging to his father is nothing less to the little boy than what Lal Haveli is to Thakur. Both Anand and Mukta have partially heard the story about Lalkunwar from the village-priest, btter known as Panditji. . With growing years Anand and Mukta develop love for each other, so much so that they become inseperable companions, if not ardent lovers. Thakur views this intimaoy with disfavour and forbids Anands entry even into Lal Haveli. . The two lovers however go on with their surreptitious meetings. These come to end when one day Mukta is asked by her father to proceed to the city to represent him on the occasion of the marriage ceremony of the daughter of Lachman Singh who, incidentally, is Thakurs oreditor, and what is more, holds Lal Haveli itself in mortgage. Her fathers indifferent state of helth forces her to obey him, and she accordingly starts for the city after having taken leave of Anand and reassured him of her love and fidelity. . Lachman Singhs son Jawahar is much attracted by Mukta, andcannot help loving her but feels shy of making his feelings known to her. He, therefore decides to fall back upon his gathers influence with Thakur to win Mukta. . On Muktas return to her village-home accompanied by Jawahar, and others, Anand wrongly scents a change in her and loses his head. He resolves to make a short work of Jawahar, and in a fit of distemper almost succeeds in carrying it out. . Jawahars father on the other hand demands the hands of Mukta in marriage with his son, and presses his demands by a threalt to take possession of Lal Haveli and demolish it should he dare refuse. Mukta, agrees to sacrifice ber own happiness at the altax of the family pride . This gives Anand the greatest shock of his life, and he leaves the village for good in distraction. In order to deown his miseried in the din and bustle of a bustle of a busy life he joins the war voluntarily offering himself for active service. While partivipating in an actual clash Anand receives a direct hit and lies between life and death. Panditji in the meantime manages to stop Muktas marriage with Jawahar Being tus frustrated Jawahar swears to wreak vengeance on Mukta by demolishing Lal Haveli and thereby bringing their family-prestige to dust. . Now, whether Lal Heveli is raised to the ground by Jawahar, and his insult avenged, of Anand succumbs to the deadly wound, as also what befell the two rival lovers, and Mukta, the object of their rivalry, are matters which really matter; these are yet to be revealed on the screen.\n\nLike * Comment * Share - Don't forget to LIKE the video and write your COMMENT's\n\nStatutory Declaration: Contents of this Film,Scene,Song which was released, as per available sources now are in the public domain since the term of copyright has expired,under the copyright act 1957.\n\nIf You Like The Video Don't Forget To Share With Others & Also Share Your Views.\nYour One Stop Destination For All The Latest Videos Subscribe Now!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SeplVintageMovies", "title": "Mohaniyan Sundar Mukhda Khol - Noor Jehan, Surendra - LAL HAVELI - Surendra, Noorjahan,Ulhas", "publishedDate": "2013-06-14T11:18:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "14SR4mOYiaQ", "description": "Sponsor: http://PeacefulAssemblyChurch.org - Free stater refuses to serve cop?

I'm not sure, but this audio session may be the first documented case of their communicating in a forest setting over such an extended period of time. \n\nAt first, when I retrieved the recorder and listened, I figured that a group must have been conducting a deer hunt, the knocks used as check-ins, to keep tabs on others' locations, and perhaps also to spook the deer in a certain direction. \n\nBut I now think that a more accurate explanation for the acoustics of this night is that the Sasquatches became aware of the presence of my surveillance equipment in their territory, or that at least one did. You'll notice that the knocker we hear most remains stationed for the duration not far from the microphone/thermal camera, perhaps warning others away\u2014or else keeping them away in effect, given that the knocks likely serve not only to inform group members of all their respective positions, but also to maintain tactical distance between these positions; thus, staying parked by the camera (once you recognize it as a threat) and then periodically knocking would keep your fellow group members safely clear of the compromised location. The single signals could mean, \"I'm over here, where are you? Hold your position until further notice.\" \n\nMaybe there are three sentinels deployed, one near, one far, and one at middle-distance, in order to cover the whole area with this strategic alert. \n\nListening to the entire six-plus hours in real time reveals that between knock events, there is nothing but (apparent) silence from the nearest member\u2014not only no vocals or stick-breaks or footsteps, but not even the slightest rustle in the leaves\u2014which suggests that he is not, in fact, relocating at all but rather performing this ancient duty while the heat is on, and inadvertently providing us with an object lesson in how Sasquatch avoids Man. \n\nActually, both explanations could be true, because why even set up a system to establish a security zone around a camera if you are not hunting here tonight, beside this lake that's a magnet for game? Otherwise, why not simply vacate the area till the coast is clear? \n\nTo quote linguist Scott Nelson (who is analyzing Sasquatch spoken language): \"American Indians felt that a photograph captured part of their spirit, their soul. If Sasquatch have anything in common with American Indians, that would explain one thing right there. We modern, species-centric humans think, 'How can they possibly understand what photographs even are?' But who are we to say? Why do we hardly ever catch them on trail cameras? I believe that we take two steps into the forest and they know exactly what's going on.\"", "title": "Sounds of a Sasquatch Stakeout", "publishedDate": "2012-01-30T16:33:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "14XhGE8Dg0k", "description": "Dr. Alan Huckleberry, piano\nThe University of Iowa Piano Pedagogy Video Recording Project\nIMTA Level D3\nFrom Les Petit Impressions\nCopyright Hal Leonard, 2002", "title": "Jennifer Linn, The Cat And The Gnat", "publishedDate": "2012-11-09T18:45:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "14Xlxk_HrK4", "description": "This is a halloween look I made it couldn't be easier.
