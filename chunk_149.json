Tiene un alto valor en el mercado debido a la utilizaci\u00f3n de uno de estos minerales, en concreto la tantalita, en la fabricaci\u00f3n de componentes para aparatos el\u00e9ctronicos (ya sea para disipadores, condensadores, etc., empleados en televisiones, smartphones, tabletas, ...).\nDe entre los pa\u00edses que se dedican a la extracci\u00f3n de coltan, destacan Brasil, Sierra Leona, China, Canad\u00e1, Per\u00fa, Nigeria, Etiopia, Namibia,...pero es la Rep\u00fablica Democr\u00e1tica del Congo la que actualmente exporta la mayor cantidad de coltan (alrededor de un 80 %) as\u00ed como es la que m\u00e1s reservas posee.\nLa extracci\u00f3n de coltan en la Rep\u00fablica Democr\u00e1tica del Congo crea una gran controversia debido a diversas situaciones que acontecen en torno a su extracci\u00f3n y comercializaci\u00f3n (situaciones laborales de la poblaci\u00f3n local al margen de los derechos humanos, situaci\u00f3n de inestabilidad pol\u00edtica, conflicto b\u00e9lico interno, milicias que controlan territorios, fuga de materias primas a pa\u00edses cercanos de manera ilegal, etc.).\nEl coltan es enviado en su mayor parte a Australia, el mayor procesador de este mineral, con empresas de gran importancia como Sons of Gwalia (actualmente atravesando un mal momento econ\u00f3mico debido a competencia surgida en otros pa\u00edses del mundo, como Egipto). Otros pa\u00edses que importan coltan para su procesado son EEUU, China, Canad\u00e1,... Alemania cuenta con las dos mayores procesadoras de coltan del mundo.\nEl precio del coltan en el mercado puede llegar a alcanzar los 400.000 USD por tonelada (ahora el precio a bajado debido a una burbuja especulativo que hubo a\u00f1os pasados).\n\n\n\nColtan is a mixture of two minerals, columbite and tantalite, which is found naturally on Earth. It has a high value on the market due to the use of one of these minerals, specifically  tantalite, in the manufacture of components for electronic devices (whether for heatsinks, capacitors, etc., Used in televisions, smartphones, tablets,. ..).\nAmong the countries that are engaged in the extraction of coltan, stand out Brazil, Sierra Leone, China, Canada, Peru, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Namibia, ... but is The Democratic Republic of the Congo that nowadays exports the major quantity of coltan (about 80 %) as well as it is the one that possesses more reservations. \nThe mining of coltan in the Democratic Republic of Congo creates a lot of controversy due to several situations that occur around its extraction and commercialization (working situations of local people outside of human rights, political instability, internal war, militias which control territories, leakage of raw materials to nearby countries  in illegally, etc.).\nColtan is sent mostly to Australia, the biggest processor of this mineral, with major companies such as Sons of Gwalia (currently going through a difficult economic time because competition emerged in other countries, such as Egypt). Other countries importing coltan for processing are the U.S., China, Canada, ... Germany has the two greatest processing of Coltan of the world .\nThe price of coltan on the market can be as high as $ 400,000 per tonne (now the price has come down due to a speculative bubble that was years past).\n\n\nVer V\u00eddeo Evoluci\u00f3n del Precio Cotizaci\u00f3n del Oro / Gold Prices Evolution:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGd3stkCVC0", "title": "El Negocio del Colt\u00e1n / The Trade of Coltan [IGEO.TV]", "publishedDate": "2012-12-05T08:40:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PExeLsHCyc", "description": "Interview de l'architecte et parrain du projet Architecture by Road; Fran\u00e7ois Font\u00e8s\nPour plus d'infos:\n\nhttp://www.architecturebyroad.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/architectureb...\nhttp://twitter.com/abroad_project\n\nhttp://www.f-fontes.fr/", "title": "// Fran\u00e7ois Font\u00e8s - Architecte et parrain du projet Architecture by Road", "publishedDate": "2013-10-19T16:35:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PF6FXueAno", "description": "torsional rigidity & Stiffness - Torsion tutorial. https://www.youtube.com/user/Universalppts\ntorsion,testicular treatment,torsion spring,torsion testing,testicular torsion ultrasound,torsional spring,torsion springs,testicular torsion causes,double torsion spring,testicular torsion symptoms,torsion test machine,torsional testing,torsion spring design,torsion testing machine,torsion spring tester,torsion test,spiral torsion spring,torsion tester,testicular health,torsion of testis,ovarian torsion,torsion meter,torsional test,testicular symptoms,testicular torsion surgery,what causes pain in the testicle,torsion bar,torsion force,treatment for twisted testicle,intermittent testicular torsion,testicular torsion photos,testicular operation,testicular torsion pictures,symptoms of testicular,testicle torsion,testicular torsion pain,what causes pain in testis,torsion testicle,testis operation,torsion testis,define torsion,torsional,torsion of testicle,testis torsion,definition of torsion,torsion definition,\nwhat is torsion,torsional force,testicular appendix torsion,torsion experiment,testicular torsion repair,testicular torsion operation,testicle operation,symptom of testicular torsion,torsion wiki,treatment of testicular torsion,torsion video,torsion of testes,what are the symptoms of testicular torsion,testical torsion,torsion define,torsion machine,testicular can,intermittent torsion,scrotaltorsion,\nacute testicular torsion,appendix testis torsion,what causes pain in testicle,torsion operation,operation of testis.", "title": "torsional rigidity & Stiffness - Torsion tutorial", "publishedDate": "2013-12-11T16:31:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PFPT9tUc0Q", "description": "", "title": "How Do I Calculate The Stowage Factor?", "publishedDate": "2014-09-21T19:06:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PFgKLPwOHE", "description": "Shepherds in central Sardegna have long been known for their particular style of singing..... more like a chant.

TEROR GRUPLARA GUC VEREN SAHTE MEDYA\nILLEGAL GRUPLARA DESTEK VEREN ICIMIZDEKI DUSMAN\n\nThe Turkish government says this was not the work of Islamist terrorists. The bomber belonged to the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP-C), a Marxist-Leninist terrorist group and a group has ties to the Assad dictatorship of Syria. This raises the possibility that Assad used DHKP-C to take revenge on Turkey for supporting the Syrian rebels.\n\nDHKP-C was viewed as a has-been terrorist group from the Cold War era. Starting out in the 1970s, it carried out attacks on Western targets in Turkey but hasn't received much attention. The suicide bomber that carried out Friday's attack was previously arrested in 1997 in connection with rocket attacks on a police station and a military officers' club. He was released from prison after a hunger strike did severe damage to his brain. The group's suicide attackers often have incurable diseases.\n\n\"Syria has provided a lot of facilities to this group, including camps, ammunition, etc. They had a really close relationship with Syrian intelligence,\" said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a Turkish terrorism expert.\n\nOzcan also said that the Assad regime restored its links to the group after Turkey began harboring Syrian rebels. DHKP-C has organized pro-Assad rallies in Turkey and has used its agents, including some posing as journalists, to spread false rumors of Syrian refugees in Turkey committing murder and other misdeeds.\n\nTurkey has arrested 85 DHKP-C members since January and charged 55 last week with planning to kill government officials and attack embassies. Some members are accused of sharing state secrets with Greece and Syria.\n\nThe DHKP-C has taken credit for the bombing and explicitly said it was in response to Turkey's policy towards Assad. It claimed that \"Syrian collaborationist looters are trained and armed on our [Turkish] land and are sent back to massacre Syrian people.\" It stated that the U.S. is its number one enemy and Turkey was assisting its \"imperialist\" plans.\n\nA DHKP-C splinter group called Acilciler, or \"Urgent Ones,\" has about 500 members and operates from Syria under the name of the \"Hatay Liberation Army.\" Its leader, Mihrac Ural, is in Latakia. In the past, he has worked closely with the Kurdish Marxist terrorist group, the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has also received Syrian backing.\n\nIran reportedly hired DHKP-C in 2010 to stroke public unrest in Turkey in an attempt to stop the constitutional referendum. However, there should be skepticism towards this accusation. Iran praised the passing of the constitutional amendments, which made Turkey more democratic and strengthened the ability of the ruling Islamist party to push its agenda.\n\nHenri Barkey, a former State Department official and professor, doubts that Syria contracted DHKP-C to carry out the bombing. He says the group is cultish and wouldn't do the bidding of someone else. Assad's involvement in a terrorist attack against a U.S. target could also backfire and stir up American support for the rebels and ASssad's ouster.\n\nIt wouldn't be out of character for Assad to sponsor a terrorist attack simply out of rage. After all, his thugs are known for deliberately targeting children, torturing political prisoners and all sorts of heinous crimes that would be unthinkable to any moral person. Secret documents published by Al-Arabiya indicate the regime was behind a fire at a mall in Qatar that killed 19 people, 13 of them children.\n\nIf Assad was behind this terrorist attack in Turkey, then it could mean that he's decided to launch a wave of reprisal attacks against his enemies. The attempted transfer of anti-aircraft missiles to Hezbollah, foiled by Israel's air strike last week, could be the result of such a decision.", "title": "CNN provocation Gezi TEROR Taksim", "publishedDate": "2013-06-11T21:36:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PHJmnjtO2s", "description": "WI\u00d1AY QHANTATI URURI DE CONIMA INTERPRETANDO TORERO", "title": "Wi\u00f1ay Qhantati Ururi de Conima en Puerto Acosta 2012 - Virgen de la Asunci\u00f3n", "publishedDate": "2012-08-25T20:12:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PHUVoL1MTs", "description": "British scientists say they have found new evolutionary evidence linking dinosaurs to birds.

If you're burning through resin, carbon dioxide may likely be the cause. Luckily, it's really easy to identify if it is indeed the issue.\n\nOne way to find out is to use a simple co2 test kit from LaMotte, which will test between zero and fifty parts per million co2 (this a common range that most people will find themselves in.) Less than 15 parts per million is generally considered somewhat low, while over thirty five parts per million is pretty high and you will be burning a lot of resin. \n\nThere are some handy calculators online, like the one at fishfriend.com, where you enter the pH and alkalinity of your water and it will estimate your co2 level. There is also a really helpful calculator on hamzasreef.com which estimates how much of your DI resin cartridge is being consumed by carbon dioxide.\n\nOnce you've identified co2 as the issue, solving the problem is pretty easy. All you need to do is give the water some time to gas off the excess co2 before it hits the di resin. The easiest way to do that is to separate the DI resin from your system and feed your storage container with just reverse osmosis water. Then, add a powerhead or air stone which can break the surface tension of the water which allows the water to gas off the excess co2.\n\nIf you have solved your co2 problems and have advice for your fellow reefers, check out the comments area down below.

Many also feel that they don't get any respect on the road from other drivers, with six out of ten saying other drivers treat them without due care, consideration or attention, while 40% say they have felt pressured into taking risks as a result of other driver behavior.\n\nAre you towing for the first time, or just fancy a refresher on how to tow safely?  Either way, watch our video, with Tim Shallcross from the Institute of Advanced Motorists and Nissan's Head of 4x4, Rachael Gregory. They share their tips and advice from how to load, manoeuvring whilst towing, hitching and unhitching to making sure your vehicle is powerful enough to tow the caravan (the Nissan X-Trail for example can pull 2200 kg,) so that you reach your destination safely.\n\nwww.nissan.co.uk/x-trail", "title": "How to tow a caravan", "publishedDate": "2012-07-18T16:37:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PaC-PLrk9s", "description": "Ayatollah's video for the \"Listen\" album", "title": "Ayatollah \"Listen\"", "publishedDate": "2006-07-21T03:43:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PaIL67CkAw", "description": "Tyrone the Turkey was evicted from the house due to suspiscion of odor.

It is a variety of nightblooming Cereus and often confused with species of Selenicereus.\n\nNative to Central America and Northern South America,the Kadupul flower blooms rarely and only at night -- mysteriously, the flower wilts before dawn. In 1909, C. A. Purpus collected a slightly different type in St. Ana, Orizaba, Mexico. It has carmine red outer petals and the flowers have an unpleasant smell, rather than being fragrant. It was originally named Phyllocactus purpusii, but does probably not deserve any botanical recognition. The Chinese chengyu (four character idiom)(tan hua yi xian) uses this flower (tan-hua;) to describe someone who has an impressive but very brief moment of glory, like a \"flash in a pan\", since the flower can take a year to bloom and only blooms over a single night. Therefore someone described as \"\u66c7\u82b1\u4e00\u73fe\" is generally understood to be a person who shows off or unexpectedly gains some achievement and is thought to be an exception or only lucky. The flower also has a rich history in Japan, where it is known as the (Gekka Bijin) or \"Beauty under the Moon\"\nIt can be found from Mexico to Venezuela, as well as Brazil. It also can be found, cultivated in parts of America with warmer temperature such as Texas or California. Epiphytic or lithophytic. 75-2.000 m alt. Widely cultivated and escaped in many places and its true origin has never been fully understood. Linked to the Legend of \"BAKAWALI\" in most S.E. Asian countries.\nAn easily cultivated, fast growing Epiphyllum . It needs compost containing plenty of humus and sufficient moisture in summer. It should not be kept under 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F) in winter. It can be grown in semi-shade or full sun. Extra light in the early spring will stimulate budding. It flowers in late spring or early summer; large specimens can produce several crops of flowers in a season. This is the most commonly grown of the Epiphyllum species, and it is known under several common names including Night-blooming Cereus, Dutchman's Pipe, Queen of the Night, Wijaya Kusuma (Indonesian), (Nishagandhi in Hindi and Marathi), Gul-e-Bakavali (in Urdu) and  (Kadupul in Sinhala). \nStems erect, ascending, scandent or sprawling, profusely branched, primary stems terete, to 2--6 m long, flattened laterally, ligneous at base, secondary stems flat, elliptic-acuminate, to 30 cm x 10--12 cm, thin; margins shallowly to deeply crenate and \u00b1 undulate. Flowers produced from flattened portions, to 30 cm long, 12--17 cm wide, nocturnal, very fragrant. The principal odor component in the aroma is benzyl salicylate; pericarpel nude, slightly angled, green, bracteoles short; receptacle 13--20 cm long, 1 cm thick, brownish, arching, bracteoles narrow, ca 10 mm long; outer tepals linear, acute, 8--10 cm long reddish to amber; inner tepals oblanceolate to oblong, acuminate, to 8--10 cm long and 2,5 cm wide, whitish; stamens greenish white or white, slender and weak; style greenish white or white, 4 mm thick, as long as inner tepals, lobes many, pale yellow or white. Fruit oblong, 12 x 8 cm, purplish red, angled.\n\nCopyrights : MrZygy3", "title": "Amazing Queen of The Night Time Lapse Part I", "publishedDate": "2012-12-27T18:02:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PbsJ9M3ZQQ", "description": "Circa 1964, A lone KM4000 leads the Shasta Daylight with a rather exotic consist.", "title": "SP Diesel Hydraulic leads Daylight", "publishedDate": "2014-03-03T02:32:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PcE_pzA9eU", "description": "How to use a compass and straightedge to construct a midpoint of a segment.", "title": "Construction 05 - Midpoint Construction", "publishedDate": "2010-05-17T21:53:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PcImKug7MI", "description": "kayla and me are having a butter delemia.

Life is uneventful until the arrival in the neighbourhood of the rich gentleman Mr Bingley, who rents a large house so he can spend the summer in the country. Mr Bingley brings with him his sister and the dashing (and richer) but proud Mr Darcy. Love is soon in the air for one of the Bennet sisters, while another may have jumped to a hasty prejudgment.

He notified the election judge at his polling place and demonstrated that it continued to cast a vote for the opposing candidate\u2019s party. Moynihan was eventually allowed to vote for Republican candidates, including his own race.\nMoynihan offered this gracious lesson to his followers on Twitter: \u201cBe careful when you vote in Illinois. Make sure you take the time to check your votes before submitting.\u201d\nCook County Clerk\u2019s Office Deputy Communications Director Jim Scalzitti, told Illinois Watchdog, the machine was taken out of service and tested.\n\u201cThis was a calibration error of the touch-screen on the machine,\u201d Scalzitti said. \u201cWhen Mr. Moynihan used the touch-screen, it improperly assigned his votes due to improper calibration.\u201d\nScalzitti stressed that at no time were Moynihan\u2019s votes actually registered, and that voters are always asked to make sure the votes they cast are correct before they are counted. Scalzitti praised Moynihan for checking his ballot and alerting the election judge of the machine\u2019s failure.\n\nOnly a complete idiot would believe that this was a calibration error. Union bosses control voting machines in Union States. Voting irregularities have been going on in Chicago every since the Mafia took over that wretched, sin filled city. Was that not the same City that gave JFK a victory over Nixon, with all of those dead voters that came from the grave to vote.\nIn the last election, those same calibration errors were reported in Nevada and a few other States, where the calibration was very favorable to democrat candidates. Does this not tell anyone there is fraud involved in our election system and particularly with the electronic voting procedures? As though it is not bad enough for election rigging by machine, a foreign company operating in a very socialist country, i.e. Spain, will do the tallying and reporting on elections in the U.S. How difficult is it to figure out what the outcome will be?\nWe need to go back to hand ballots, that provide a source document for each vote. If there are hanging chads, then they need to be thrown away. Each voter is responsible for checking their own voting ballot. Voting ID is an absolute must, to insure only citizens of this country are eligible to vote. Voting should be done on one day period. That way voters from different States, cannot vote in more then one election precinct. If they have more then one residence in two States, then their ballot should be marked as a primary ballot for either State, but not both. These are simple and very easy instructions to follow and if a citizen cannot understand them, that citizen should not be voting.\n\nAt the very least everyone needs to verify their ballot choices before you submit it!", "title": "Voting Machine Switching GOP Votes to Democrat in Illinois", "publishedDate": "2014-10-24T00:24:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Pi4_c_1SW8", "description": "Zim Dancehall (No Mercy Riddim)", "title": "tocky vibes - ndini ndinorira", "publishedDate": "2014-04-20T22:16:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Pi9PLPN3_c", "description": "Grizzle ,Prints, Mottles, Bar Birds", "title": "Tippler Pigeons for sale limited time. ..", "publishedDate": "2013-08-05T13:17:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PiM0qg90zg", "description": "mi1ra noche en biza...IRREAL......gracias por su apoyo....", "title": "Dj berzelius biza 27 nov celebration.MOV", "publishedDate": "2009-12-30T18:07:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PjIK5ysfJY", "description": "server:kitpvp.eu\nfala galera do yotube blz,joaoaffonso aqui trazendo mais um v\u00eddeo o segundo v\u00eddeo da s\u00e9rie first to three contra amigos, deem sua opini\u00e3o sobre a s\u00e9rie e me digam se vcs querem uma s\u00e9rie de first to three ou five contra inscritos\neditor ou dnz voluntario a ser dnz ou editor do canal entre em contato:\nSkype:live:joao-affonso1\n obrigado por assistir e pf deixe sua avalia\u00e7\u00e3o like-dislike+fav ou n\nobrigado por assistir e falou", "title": "first to three contra amigos #2 (lomck)", "publishedDate": "2014-06-07T22:02:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "8PjU3TBQ5Xw", "description": "After the unsucessful game of mission impossible, Meagan decides to go meet Juniper.

The story is carried by thoughts and emotions. It is a story about friendship, and how sometimes you will find a friend in the least expected way. It is a story about working through differences, and learning to accept each other. If you have not noticed yet, Juniper is a very mysterious girl.

They send their stooge Kanakaraj to assassinate Krishnadeva Raya, but Kanakaraj fails \nin his mission and is put to death. Then they planned courtesan Krishnasini. Krishnasini enters Vijayanagaram, and \nwith her acclaimed dancing skills, manages to elicit the notice of the King, a great connoisseur of arts and beauty. She then plays her cards cleverly and besotted by her intelligent repartees and smoldering sensuousness, the susceptible King is soon a puppet in her hands. Orders are given that anyone who enters their private chamber would be beheaded and the King spends with Krishnasini's for months. Reports reach the ministers that the Sultans are planning to take advantage of the King's inaccessibility and launch a combined attack on Vijayanagaram. Worried at the state of affairs, Tenali Raman braves the prohibitory order and enters Krishnasini's abode dressed as a woman, but all his appeals to the King seem to fall on deaf ears. Meanwhile Queen Tirumalamba falls seriously sick and the King finally comes out of his daze. Once the King is at his wife's bedside, Tenali Ramakrishna \nmanages to gain entry into Krishnasini's house again, this time under the guise of an omniscient saint who assures \nher that he would bring the King back to her. He catches her red-handed with her gang of spies, and signals to the \nhidden soldiers to surround her. Realized that the game is up, Krishnasini prefers a dignified death. Shocked to see \nher stab herself, Timmarusu remonstrates with her that she has acted in haste, for the King would have certainly \nforgiven her.\n\nWatch more movies @\nhttp://www.youtube.com/volgavideo\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/newvolgavideo/videos?view=1", "title": "Tenali Ramakrishna Songs - Jagamula Dayanele - NTR, ANR, Jamuna", "publishedDate": "2014-06-27T09:10:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Pky7DhGPJA", "description": "here is my 2002 focus with tru bendz piping and a borla muffler", "title": "Ford Focus 2002 Borla exhaust mandrel bent", "publishedDate": "2012-08-28T03:09:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Pl-vhVoYBw", "description": "Test entre deux ampoules GU10 halog\u00e8ne et led.

This is useful for all the organs of the body, hence called Sarvangasana. This is difficult to practice in the beginning; but could be taken up after practicing the Khatwangasana for a few days. Practice the posture as shown in the picture keeping the legs as straight as possible. Eyes should be closed. Breasting should be slow and normal. The posture may be retained for 30 seconds in the first week, gradually increasing by 30 seconds every week upto two minutes. It is enough if the posture is maintained for five minutes with care. No strain should be felt in the shoulders or in the neck. The lifting up of the body and brining down should be smooth without any jerks.\n\nYoga provides a series of exercises that improves the functioning of the eyes and helps to overcome various eye-related problems, such as,\nMyopia or short sightedness\nHypermetropia or long sightedness\nVarious other eye-related disorders\nIn the present day world about 35 % of the population suffers from myopia and hypermetropia in varying degrees. These disorders are usually overcome using powerful glasses and lenses which correct the refractive errors of the eye. However one needs to understand that glasses never cure bad eyesight. In fact, using powerful glasses can worsen eye problems. Therefore, one should use glasses only when absolutely necessary.\n\nOther than a few diseases such as cataract and glaucoma which occur due to bacterial infections, many eye disorders are related to the malfunctioning of the ocular muscles caused by chronic mental and emotional tensions.

Jim Rogers: Brazil wants to compete with the US dollar\n\nDiscussing the recent BRICs conference, Jim Rogers noted the steady drumbeat to displace the US as the world\u2019s reserve currency of choice.  \u201cBrazil wants to compete with the IMF, the World Bank and the US dollar,\u201d as do all participants in the BRICs conference, Rogers said when speaking on an RT interview.\n\n\u201cBrazil, China and Russia could easily put something together to compete with the US dollar,\u201d Rogers said, leaving out one component of the BRICs alliance. \u201cThe US dollar is a terribly flawed currency. I\u2019m an American. I hate to say that. But the US has serious problems, the world has serious problems. We need something else\u201d and potentially a competing world currency could be developed. If this were to occur, the US and its economy might be put in a straight jacket as the ability to engage in large deficit spending could be curtailed. Jim Rogers: BRICs developing an alternative banking system\n\nTo put together a competing world reserve currency and develop an alternative banking system, the BRICs might consider throwing India out of the equation, Jim Rogers said. India has been said to be the stumbling block in establishing the new world bank. \u201cIndia and Brazil have big (national) debts. Russia is not a big debtor and has big international reserves,\u201d Rogers noted, pivoting to Russian advantages in the interview. \u201cRussia has a freely convertible currency and none of the others have a freely convertible currency.\u201d \"jim rogers\" russia china brazil brics usd \"u.s. dollar\" currency bank world banking \"bank account\" india money investment investing employment alliance \"south america\" 2014 2015 usd forex \"forex trading\" debt global alternative competition \"latin america\" europe manufacturing import export goods supplies business cheap \"china factory\" factory markets trading trade u.s. usa \"made in usa\" \"united states\" \"credit card\" international power control entertainment news media \"elite nwo agenda\" logistics gerald celente max keiser rant alex jones infowars glenn beck coast to coast am lindsey williams david icke marc faber doom gloom bubble montegraph false flag attack stock market \n\nJim Rogers thinks Russia should spend its time courting suitors in its own neighborhood, however. \u201cIf I were Russia I would be more interested in selling to Asia than South America.\u201d\n\nAs reported two days ago in ValueWalk, the leaders of Russia, India, Brazil, China and South Africa are in meetings ending July 17 to bring together plans to create a $100 billion bank to compete with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The planed bank is a piece in a larger puzzle to provide a global alternative to Western dominance of the financial system.  This has been a stated goal of Russia and China, both of whom have engaged in trade deals that eschew the use of the US dollar. James Beeland \"Jim\" Rogers, Jr. (born October 19, 1942) is an American businessman, investor and author. He is currently based in Singapore. Rogers is the Chairman of Rogers Holdings and Beeland Interests, Inc. He was the co-founder of the Quantum Fund and creator of the Rogers International Commodities Index (RICI). In May 2012 he remarked during an interview with Forbes Magazine that \"there's going to be a huge shift in American society, American culture, in the places where one is going to get rich. The stock brokers are going to be driving taxis. The smart ones will learn to drive tractors so they can work for the smart farmers. The farmers are going to be driving Lamborghinis. I\u2019m telling you. You should start Forbes Farming.\"[17] 2013: Street Smarts: Adventures on the Road and in the Markets \u2013 ISBN 0-307-98607-1", "title": "JIM ROGERS - RUSSIA / CHINA / BRAZIL Joining Forces to Avoid  U.S. DOLLAR", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T15:30:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Q3N0lgkXDc", "description": "Two Customers are angered at a McDonalds Employee.", "title": "Customers attacks McDonalds Employee", "publishedDate": "2012-12-11T04:51:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Q3QIzjmFk8", "description": "Vocal Spectrum - Cool Yule \nAOH Christmas Show 2009", "title": "Vocal Spectrum - Cool Yule", "publishedDate": "2009-12-20T00:41:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Q3w8VrYLLw", "description": "Watch how to go online to stop getting Credit Card and Insurance solicitations in your mailbox with OptOutPreScreen, a national registry which allows you to say NO to all that junk mail.", "title": "Opt Out of Credit Card and Insurance mailing offers", "publishedDate": "2011-02-25T14:51:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Q481-V6R2c", "description": "Try this the next time you have steaks on the grill.", "title": "Grilled Romaine Lettuce", "publishedDate": "2012-03-16T23:12:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Q48WoyS8wY", "description": "Thank you guys so much for watching!

Put marbles in the tub and pour the hot water. Today I'm using Lavender for relaxation and Bergamot for uplifting the mood. If the water is so hot you can't even put your fingers pour some water. \nMake sure you have the towel handy before you wet your feet. Put your feet in the tub and say \"Ahhh~.\" Enjoy the warm bath and aroma until you and your feet feel enough. Place the towel next to the tub and dry your feet. \n\nYou can also add some Epsom salt to relieve the tired feet and you can also sprinkle some rose petals to make it more romantic.

Most of the 1100 species possess an asymmetrical abdomen which is concealed in an empty gastropod shell that is carried around by the hermit crab.\n\nMost species have long, spirally curved abdomens, which are soft, unlike the hard, calcified abdomens seen in related crustaceans. The vulnerable abdomen is protected from predators by a salvaged empty seashell carried by the hermit crab, into which its whole body can retract. Most frequently hermit crabs use the shells of sea snails (although the shells of bivalves and scaphopods and even hollow pieces of wood and stone are used by some species). The tip of the hermit crab's abdomen is adapted to clasp strongly onto the columella of the snail shell.\n\nAs the hermit crab grows in size, it has to find a larger shell and abandon the previous one. This habit of living in a second hand shell gives rise to the popular name \"hermit crab\", by analogy to a hermit who lives alone. Several hermit crab species, both terrestrial and marine, use \"vacancy chains\" to find new shells: when a new, bigger shell becomes available, hermit crabs gather around it and form a kind of queue from largest to smallest. When the largest crab moves into the new shell, the second biggest crab moves into the newly vacated shell, thereby making its previous shell available to the third crab, and so on.\n\nJaco (also sometimes written as Jako) is a small island in the Lesser Sunda Islands. It lies across from the easternmost point of the island of Timor.The island is uninhabited. It is considered holy by the indigenous population and entering the island was forbidden. tourists are taken by fishermen to the island for diving and swimming.Politically it is part of the subdistrict of Tutuala within Laut\u00e9m district of East Timor. It is separated from the mainland by a narrow channel, suitable for passage by small vessels only.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

But first you have to do a couple of things to make sure you get the top quality that you are looking for in a diced green onion. First, what we have to do is make sure we have got all the cruddy stuff off of there. Some of these will start to flatten out or look a little dry - they have got bent or broken ends. So we are going to go through and just pull that stuff away. \n\nThe next thing you want to do, even though the roots have been washed and you could technically eat these, they are not very tasty, so what we are going to want to do is we are going to line these all up and make one cut to cut all these off. The last thing you are going to want to do before you start dicing up your green onion is line up the onion again on the backside, and look for the most common starting point which would be right about here on this bunch of onions. And basically what that does is it starts you off with nice even cuts moving backwards towards the white part of the onion. When you start the cuts, you want to stabilize all the shoots - you want to have them as tight as possible, and you want to make sure that your knife cut goes all the way through. And it is really important that you have a sharp knife so before we started this today I made sure that my knife was honed down and put onto the steel so that we could get a nice true cut. So start at the end and pick your thickness, and you could go as wide or as thin as you want - I will go about a quarter of an inch. So start at the top, one motion, pull through, line it up again and then just follow through all the way down. And basically that is going to sever those green shoots nice and cleanly so that when you are all done, you do not have anything that look like they are hooked together. These are all dry. \n\nNow that we have got the onions all diced up and ready to go into your dish, there is a couple of things that you can do. The green onions are really great on salads, and I especially like to use them in fried rice. Usually on the beginning of the dish, I go in with the white onions and we stir fry that with the garlic and the ginger and all the other vegetables, maybe a pineapple fried rice, and then just before the rice is done we go in with the green onions and that creates a huge bouquet of aroma. That nice green onion smell combined with the peppers, the onions and in this case maybe a pineapple - excellent flavor. It really livens up a dish and makes it nice and bright and really melds well with the other flavors going on.", "title": "How to Dice Green Onion", "publishedDate": "2011-09-30T07:02:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "8QGYd8hDElg", "description": "Coastal Carolina continues their winning ways in Conway, SC defeating CAA opponent Elon 31-3", "title": "2014 Coastal Carolina Football vs. Elon", "publishedDate": "2014-09-28T05:50:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "8QGemufNsMg", "description": "So, this video is a little different than what I would normally post here as it's primarily about the video and not the music.

The African forms may represent a separate species but have usually been considered as subspecies of the Shikra. The Shikra is very similar in appearance to other sparrowhawk species including the Chinese Goshawk and Eurasian Sparrowhawk. They have a sharp two note call and have the typical flap and glide flight. Their calls are imitated by drongos and the Common Hawk-Cuckoo resembles it in plumage.\nThe Shikra is found in a range of habitats including forests, farmland and urban areas. They are usually seen singly or in pairs. The flight is typical with flaps and glides. During the breeding season pairs will soar on thermals and stoop at each other. Their flight usually draws alarms among smaller birds and squirrels. They feed on rodents (including Meriones hurrianae), squirrels, small birds, small reptiles (mainly lizards but sometimes small snakes) and insects. Small birds usually dive through foliage to avoid a Shikra and a Small Blue Kingfisher has been observed diving into water to escape. Babblers have been observed to rally together to drive away a Shikra. They will descend to the ground to feast on emerging winged termites, hunt at dusk for small bats (such as Cynopterus sphinx) and in rare instances they may even resort to feed on carrion. In one instance a male was found feeding on a dead chick at the nest. Their calls are mimicked by drongos and this behaviour is thought to aid in stealing food by alarming other birds that the drongos associate with.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

She's in a severe amount of paranoia, fear, everything that makes Alison 'Alison.'\"\n\nAlison has made a deal with the Dyad Institute to maintain her status quo life, but the sands are shifting beneath her feet.  Under the impression that her friend and neighbor Aynsley was her monitor, she stood idly by while Aynsley was strangled to death by a garbage disposal.

His character was created to add a practitioner of Judo to the cast, and many elements from his original designs, such as his geta and his victory cries, remained for his final look. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Daimon was voted as the staff's forty-fourth favorite character. He shared the spot with Street Fighter character, Alex.\n\nThe idea for his earthquakes -as well as the other elemental powers for the rest of the Japan team- was derived from the anime Getter Robo. In the show, there were three featured heroes who served as the inspiration for the KOF trio: the protagonist had a \"fiery\" persona, his friend was \"edgy and daring\", and the third hero was the \"down-to-earth giant\". It is also a homage to a Japanese phrase of giving birth to fire (roughly translated: lighting strikes the earth which sparks the flame). In The King of Fighters '97, Orochi Yashiro became his elemental rival, as both men share the ability to manipulate earth. His official nickname is The Rising Storm.\n\nHe is voiced by Masaki Usui.

Blatty transformed the little boy in the 1949 incident into a little girl named Regan, played by 14-year-old Linda Blair. Suddenly prone to fits and bizarre behavior, Regan proves quite a handful for her actress-mother, Chris MacNeil (played by Ellen Burstyn, although Blatty reportedly based the character on his next-door neighbor Shirley MacLaine). When Regan gets completely out of hand, Chris calls in young priest Father Karras (Jason Miller), who becomes convinced that the girl is possessed by the Devil and that they must call in an exorcist: namely, Father Merrin (Max von Sydow). His foe proves to be no run-of-the-mill demon, and both the priest and the girl suffer numerous horrors during their struggles. The Exorcist received a theatrical rerelease in 2000, in a special edition that added 11 minutes of footage trimmed from the film's original release and digitally enhanced Chris Newman's Oscar-winning sound work.\n\n\"the exorcist\",\"the exorcist clip\",\"the exorcist trailer\",\"the exorcist part 1\",\"the exorcist theme song\",\"the exorcist full movie\",\"the exorcist spider walk\",\"the exorcist scariest scene\",\"the exorcist theme\",\"linda blair\",\"jason miller\",\"william friedkin\",\"classic horror movies\",classics,\"cult horror\",\"satanic stories\",\"david salven\",\"noel marshall\",\"william peter blatty\",\"evil videos\",regan,\"father karras\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++16331,/m/09np3s,/m/020xv2", "title": "The Exorcist (2/5) Movie CLIP - Projectile Vomit (1973) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T03:22:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Qk4ENztNW4", "description": "Treino de abd\u00f4men da Juju Salimeni e da Eva Andressa na Academia Xploud em S\u00e3o Paulo.

It is the oldest extant (living) vascular plant division at around 410 million years old. These species reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations, although some are homosporous while others are heterosporous. Members of Lycopodiophyta bear a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant. They differ from all other vascular plants in having microphylls, leaves that have only a single vascular trace (vein) rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC-BY-3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopodiophyta\n\nText to Speech powered by voice-rss.com\n\nImages are Public Domain or CC-BY-3.0:\nLycopodiophyta_pl.jpg from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lycopodiophyta_pl.jpg\n\nLycopodiella_inundata_001.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopodiophyta", "title": "All About - Lycopodiophyta", "publishedDate": "2014-11-08T16:52:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "8QoaPF134gg", "description": "The Six Foot Man-Eating balloon swallows Brad whole.

Visit http://www.bestogdendentist.com/ or call us at (801) 783-3490 for more information about dental care services in Ogden Utah.\n\nAn endodontist is a specialty in dentistry. Endodontists have to go to school for three to four years after dental school. They specialize in doing root canals. Dentists may or may not do root canals. They're licensed to, but some choose not to do the root canals. Some will refer all their root canals to an endodontist. Even dentists that do root canals may refer to endodontists if they find that the root canal is particularly difficult. The root canals that are particularly difficult would be further back in your mouth, the molars. Or if you happen to be an elderly person, the insides of the teeth get very hard to navigate as we get on in years. So an endodontist only does root canals, every day, all day, that's what they're doing and so they're very, very talented and skilled in what they do, which is doing a professional job at a root canal. You will then need to return to your dentist for a filling. The endodontist will not place the filing or the crown, they will simply do the root canal and follow up until your symptoms have subsided and then you will return to your regular dentist.\u2028Hopefully this video has answered your question.

New Citroen consists of 200 parts. Almost all the materials it is made from are recyclable. Citroen introduced a number of new design features to the C-Cactus. The dashboard has been removed in favour of grouping key controls on the central console and steering wheel hub, while a modular stowage system, allowing the sliding of the rear bench to reveal further under-floor stowage, increases bootspace from 500 to 1100 litres.\nThe car has sharp styling and attractive features. Its curves give it a fun look and strong appeal, while the angles and rounded lines of the bodywork underline its dynamic character. It is 4.2 metres long and 1.8 metres wide with a wide range of equipment including air conditioning with automatic temperature control, a high-quality audio system, a panoramic glass sunroof, cruise control and a speed limiter. Moreover, the interior of the car has been created by removing material. This idea of decorating \"in a vacuum\" is reflected in the patterns present on the door panels and seat frames. The patterns cut-out in the door panels show the apple green felt inserted between panel and metal. The main role of this part is to soundproof the vehicle, but its colour and cut-outs make it an integral part of the d\u00e9cor. The same flower, plant and butterfly patterns -- symbolising the environment, purity and well-being -- are also found on several other cabin features.", "title": "Citroen C Cactus Concept", "publishedDate": "2013-10-25T18:26:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8QvoJ5lpyJM", "description": "FREE SIGN UP !!!

What does real biochemistry tell us? http://infactvideo.com\n\nHigh fructose corn syrup, the popular artificial sweetener, has been controversial ever since it was first introduced. So what exactly is it, and why the controversy?\n\nAll sugars, of which ordinary table sugar is the most familiar, consist of various combinations of the basic building blocks: monosaccharides, or single sugars. A molecule of table sugar consists of one glucose, and one fructose, chemically bonded into what we call a disaccharide, or two sugars.\n\nHigh fructose corn syrup consists of the same two monosaccharides; the only difference is that they're not bonded together. This one change makes it a liquid instead of a crystalline solid.\n\nLiquid sugar gives food manufacturers several important benefits. It's easier to transport and handle in liquid form. It has certain advantages in baking, browning, and fermentability. It doesn't recrystallize after baking like sugar can, and makes foods moister. And perhaps most significantly, it allows the proportion of glucose and fructose to be adjusted. HFCS 55, which is 55% fructose, has a sweetness comparable to sugar and is used mainly in soft drinks. HFCS 42 is 42% fructose, and is a little less sweet than sugar and is used in most other foods.\n\nBut cost is also a huge factor. In the United States, we can grow our corn; but we have to import our sugar. Countries all hit each other with import tariffs, so high fructose corn syrup is cheaper in North America, and sugar is cheaper in South America. That's the reason Coca-Cola is different north or south of the border.\n\nNow when you eat sugar, the very first thing your digestive system does is to break this bond. This starts happening the moment the sugar hits your saliva. This makes sugar and high fructose corn syrup, chemically, exactly the same thing.\n\nThe Internet is bursting at the seams with warnings that high fructose corn syrup is somehow poisonous or toxic or more harmful than regular sugar. The one place you won't find these warnings is in the scientific literature, where we consistently find there's no significant difference in their effect on the body, just as basic chemistry predicts.\n\nThere's one warning about high fructose corn syrup that's exactly the same as for sugar: YOU SHOULDN'T EAT EITHER ONE OF THEM; they're all empty calories that just make you fat. Any added sweetener exceeds the amount of sugars your body actually needs, which you already get from any normal diet.", "title": "inFact: High Fructose Corn Syrup", "publishedDate": "2012-07-01T16:44:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "8RDUbJGtAqA", "description": "Leon reconoce a la mujer que le salvo la vida", "title": "Leon reconoce a la mujer que le salvo la vida. primicia - LOVINGLY LION HUGS A WOMAN", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T18:05:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "8RDXP9xRXtk", "description": "Ra\u00fal explica los planes para el tercer d\u00eda: subir al C1.

Nowruz is also widely referred to as the Persian New Year. \n\nNowruz is celebrated and observed by Iranian peoples and the related cultural continent and has spread in many other parts of the world, including parts of Central Asia, South Asia, Northwestern China, the Crimea and some groups in the Balkans.\n\nNowruz marks the first day of spring and the beginning of the year in Iranian calendar. It is celebrated on the day of the astronomical vernal equinox, which usually occurs on March 21 or the previous/following day depending on where it is observed. As well as being a Zoroastrian holiday and having significance amongst the Zoroastrian ancestors of modern Iranians, the same time is celebrated in parts of the South Asian sub-continent as the new year. The moment the Sun crosses the celestial equator and equalizes night and day is calculated exactly every year and Iranian families gather together to observe the rituals.\n\nOriginally being a Zoroastrian festival, and the holiest of them all, Nowruz is believed to have been invented by Zoroaster himself, although there is no clear date of origin. Since the Achaemenid era the official year has begun with the New Day when the Sun leaves the zodiac of Pisces and enters the zodiacal sign of Aries, signifying the Spring Equinox.\n\nThe Jewish festival of Purim is probably adopted from the Persian New Year. It is also a holy day for Sufis, Ismailis, Alawites, Alevis, and adherents of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. \n\nThe term Nowruz in writing, first appeared in Persian records in the 2nd century AD, but it was also an important day during the time of the Achaemenids (c. 648-330 BC), where kings from different nations under the Persian empire used to bring gifts to the Emperor, also called King of Kings (Shahanshah), of Persia on Nowruz. The significance of Nowruz in the Achaemenid empire was such that the great Persian king Cambyses II's appointing as the king of Babylon was legitimized only after his participation in the New Year festival (Nowruz). \n\nThe UN's General Assembly in 2010 recognized the International Day of Nowruz, describing it a spring festival of Persian origin which has been celebrated for over 3,000 years. During the meeting of The Inter-governmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage of the United Nations, held between 28 September -- 2 October 2009 in Abu Dhabi, Nowr\u016bz was officially registered on the UNESCO List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\n\n--\n\nThe Haft S\u012bn items are: * sabzeh - wheat, barley or lentil sprouts growing in a dish - symbolizing rebirth * samanu - a sweet pudding made from wheat germ - symbolizing affluence * senjed - the dried fruit of the oleaster tree - symbolizing love * s\u012br - garlic - symbolizing medicine * s\u012bb - apples - symbolizing beauty and health * somaq - sumac berries - symbolizing (the color of) sunrise * serkeh - vinegar - symbolizing age and patience.\n\nOther items on the table may include: * Sonbol - Hyacinth (plant) * Sekkeh - Coins - representative of wealth * traditional Iranian pastries such as baghlava, toot, naan-nokhodchi * Aajeel - dried nuts, berries and raisins * lit candles (enlightenment and happiness) * a mirror (symbolizing cleanness and honesty) * decorated eggs, sometimes one for each member of the family (fertility) * a bowl of water with goldfish (life within life, and the sign of Pisces which the sun is leaving).

MAD can also describe the Japanese AMV community.\n\nMADs consist of more than just videos. Some MADs consist entirely of audio clips. Some kinds of edited pictures can be considered MADs. MADs do not necessarily even need to be related to anime, though the more popular ones typically are.\n\nMAD is not an acronym for anything, but rather, is thought to be a reference to the name of one of the original MADs.

They show marked sexual dimorphism, with only the males having horns. Adult males have a grey to bluish-grey coat, with white spots on the cheeks and white colouring on the edges of the lips. They also have a white throat bib and a narrow white stripe along the underside of the body that widens at the rear. The tips of the long, tufted tail and of the ears are black. They also possess a tubular-shaped \"pennant\" of long, coarse hair on the midsection of the throat.\nThe males have two black, conical horns, arising close together just behind the eyes. The horns project upwards, but are slightly curved forward; they measure between 15 and 24 centimetres (5.9 and 9.4 in) in a fully grown adult. Although the horns are usually smooth, in some older males, they may develop ring-shaped ridges near the base.\nIn contrast, females and young are tawny brown in colour, although otherwise with similar markings to the male; they have no horns and only a very small \"pennant\". Both sexes have an erect mane on the back of the neck, terminating in a bristly \"hog-tuft\" just above the shoulders.\nNilgai are diurnal, and tend to form single-sex herds outside of the breeding season. Herds are not of fixed composition, with individuals joining and rejoining through the year. Female herds typically contain three to six adults, together with their calves, whereas bulls form herds of two to 18 individuals.In winter, male nilgai form herds of 30 to 100 animals in northern India.\nNilgai herds in Texas have been reported to have an average home range of 4.3 square kilometres (1.7 sq mi). Both males and females mark their territories by defecating in fixed locations on open ground, with piles building up to reach at least 3 m (9.8 ft) in diameter. They also possess scent glands on the legs and close to the feet, which they may use to scent mark their daily resting places. They are generally quiet animals, but have been reported to make short guttural grunts when alarmed, and females to make clicking noises when nursing young.\nilgai are habitat generalists, living in grasslands and woodlands where they eat grasses, leaves, buds, and fruit. They avoid dense forest and prefer the plains and low hills with shrubs, but may also be found in cultivated areas.\nNilgai are usually found in their favoured areas of scrub jungle (acacia forests) grazing upon succulent kader grass. They are not averse to crossing marshlands.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilgai", "title": "\" The nilgai \" At Alipore Zoo,Kolkata,India", "publishedDate": "2014-07-27T13:29:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "8RbbNy_yzcg", "description": "VULGAR - \"I Don't Wanna Go To Heaven\"\n\nClip promoting new album \"The Professional Blasphemy\"\n\nvisit: \nhttp://vulgar.pl\nhttp://facebook.com/SexDrugsViolenceDeath\nhttp://myspace.com/vulgarpunk\n\nvulgar@vulgar.pl\n\nfor more details please visit VULGAR pages:\n\nhttp://vulgar.pl\nhttp://myspace.com/vulgarpunk\n\nYou will also find us on facebook.\n\nProduced by: OP1 - Outpost One Entertainment \nauthor: Marcin \"Martinez\" Swystun\nediting: Bartek Rusiecki oraz Jacek Swystun\ncamera operators: Marcin \"Martinez\" Swystun, Arkadiusz Okonski, Nobody", "title": "VULGAR - \"I Don't Wanna Go To Heaven\"", "publishedDate": "2010-04-07T08:23:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Rc3-l6y5Lc", "description": "White is for Witching is a mesmerizing Gothic tale from the phenomenally talented author of The Icarus Girl, Helen Oyeyemi.

Whether you will score or not will depend greatly on how good your confidence is.\n\nPoor confidence means often a missed penalty kick before you even have placed the ball on the penalty spot - think positive!\nPerforming the Penalty\n\nNow let's take a look on how to perform a penalty kick in 6 steps:\n\n1. Place the ball on the penalty spot. Try to spot any little holes or obstacles that could cause the ball to fly off course.\n\n2. Now, let the ball lie on the spot and start to focus on how to beat the goalkeeper. Do not listen to your opponents talk or any other attempt that could distract you. Simply put, forget everything around your besides the penalty kick.\n\n3. Decide which corner you will aim at. Don't look straight at that corner as the goalkeeper may spot that and figure out where you are aiming. You may also look at the right but place the ball to the left. On this way the goalkeeper will have no clue which corner you will choose.\n\n4. Take a breath and start to run towards the ball.\n\n5. Your kick should be hard and decisive. Whatever you do, don't change your mind about where you will kick the ball at this stage. Ignore any shout from defenders and keep an eye on the goalkeeper's movement.\n\n6. Try to place the ball in the area that lies about 1.5m from each post. The goalkeeper will be standing in the middle which gives him a 4 meters range. He will get hard to defend the 1.5m at each post. This is why you should place the ball in that area. If you place the ball with power, low and with accuracy the goal will be yours.\nTips\n\n    Watch for the goalkeeper's movement. Try to decide whether the goalkeeper will dive at the left or the right. However, you need to be aware of that your opponents' goalkeeper may want to fool you so be cautious.\n\n    Keep yourself calm and breathe properly. Penalty kicks are one of the easiest ways of getting a panic attack. However, think positively and avoid thinking: What if I miss?\n\n    Do not reveal where you will shoot as the goalie will usually spot this and take advantage of that.\n\nSummary\n\nA penalty kick is pretty easy to perform during your soccer practice. I bet that if you shot 10 times you will score 10/10.\n\nHowever, the problem you'll face during your games is not the level of your soccer skills, it's the mental part.\n\nYou see, your mind will start to bother you and you will start to have doubts about your performance!\n\nThis is why great soccer players miss penalties, they start to doubt in themselves!\n\nWho needs that type of doubt?

Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals, while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi. Fertilization is the fusion of both sex cell or gameteCopulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for insemination and subsequent internal fertilization. Mating may also lead to external fertilization, as seen in amphibians, fishes and plants. For the majority of species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. However, for some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not required because the parent organism is capable of self-fertilization (autogamy); for example, banana slugs.\nFor animals, mating strategies include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring.

There is no sound.\n\nThe heddles for a 2 sided loom are a piece of string. They are not loops which are used on 1 sided looms. The string can be anything strong enough to take a bit of tension, and that won't fray. You don't want anything too scratchy like twine as it might be rough on your warp threads. I use cotton crochet thread. I get the string from the scrap ends of other weavings or from the ends of the warps from my tapestry weavings. \n\nA heddle is placed on every other warp. They are placed on the upper shed warps and are pulled down between the lower shed warps. Each heddle is then tied to the heddle peg. As you tie them on, pull down so the top warps are even with each other and come to the level of the lower warps.\n\nI place several heddles on at a time and then tie them in bunches. This saves time. It is also helpful when weaving with skinnier yarns. If tied individually, the knots of the heddles can take up more room than the warp yarns. This causes the warp to be flared out wider near the heddle bar. I find it difficult to keep the width as consistent when this happens. Grouping the heddles together reduces the flare.\n\nI tie the heddles on with a gooseneck knot. That way I can pull the end of the heddles to easily undo the knot when I am finished weaving. This makes it easier to reuse the heddles.", "title": "Applying Heddles for a 2 sided Inkle Loom", "publishedDate": "2014-01-22T21:23:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "8S53q_wpovY", "description": "not my video.", "title": "Hantu 3gp Brunei", "publishedDate": "2007-08-10T14:21:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "8S5K0Cb8P5U", "description": "Subscribe . . .

En muchas bromas existe una crueldad inherente que las hace dif\u00edciles de diferenciar del acoso, el sadismo, el vandalismo o el hooliganismo.\n\nEn la cultura occidental suele dedicarse un d\u00eda al a\u00f1o para llevar a cabo bromas, como el d\u00eda de los Santos Inocentes en la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses de habla hispana, o el d\u00eda de las bromas de abril en otros pa\u00edses. Otro d\u00eda com\u00fan para bromas es el d\u00eda de Halloween, bajo la forma del \u00abtruco o trato\u00bb. Tambi\u00e9n se hacen bromas en las fiestas de cumplea\u00f1os de adolescentes y adultos (principalmente en Latinoam\u00e9rica), as\u00ed como en carnaval. Las bromas en las que se utiliza el tel\u00e9fono como medio se denominan bromas telef\u00f3nicas.\n\nLa masificaci\u00f3n de las Web 2.0 ha revitalizado la producci\u00f3n de bromas, como consecuencia de la facilidad que entregan estos sitios para compartir la informaci\u00f3n, el nuevo impulso que han tenido las bromas, ha convertido a la \u00e9poca actual, en una edad de oro, por la proliferaci\u00f3n de bromas caseras amateur y profesionales. Youtube realiz\u00f3 una gr\u00e1fica en la cual muestra el explosivo crecimiento que han tenido las visualizaciones de v\u00eddeos y canales dedicados a las bromas.\n\n\n\n\nStreich\n\nDer Streich (auch Schabernack, Jokus und Ulk) ist eine mutwillige, listige oder hinterlistige Handlung gegen andere, die keine schwerwiegenden rechtlichen Folgen hat.\n\nEtymologie\n\nDas Substantiv Streich bedeutete zun\u00e4chst \u2013 und bis heute \u2013 auch \u201eSchlag, Hieb\u201c (vgl. engl. to strike) und fand seit dem 15. Jahrhundert h\u00e4ufige Verwendung in der Zusammensetzung Backenstreich. Im 17. Jahrhundert gewann es als unerwarteter Schlag oder \u00fcberraschende Unternehmung an Bedeutung, beispielsweise beim milit\u00e4rischen Handstreich. Die Redewendung \u201ejemandem einen Streich spielen\u201c stammt aus dem 18. Jahrhundert. (Jokus leitet sich aus dem Lateinischen iocus ab. Die Herkunft der Wortes Schabernack ist ungekl\u00e4rt. Ulk kommt urspr\u00fcnglich durch die Studentensprache aus dem Niederdeutschen und bedeutete \u201eL\u00e4rm, Unruhe, H\u00e4ndel\u201c.)\n\n\n\n\nPractical joke\n\nA practical joke (also known as a prank, gag, jape or shenanigan) is a mischievous trick or joke played on someone, generally causing the victim to experience embarrassment, perplexity, confusion, or discomfort. Practical jokes range from confidence tricks or hoaxes in that the victim finds out, or is let in on the joke, rather than being talked into handing over money or other valuables. Practical jokes or pranks are generally lighthearted, reversible and non-permanent, and aim to make the victim feel foolish or victimised to a degree, but may also involve cruelty verging on bullying if performed without appropriate finesse.\n\n\n\n\nHumour potache\n\nL'humour potache est un humour moqueur portant peu \u00e0 cons\u00e9quence, qui n'offense pas autrui, et qui n'est pas bas\u00e9 sur un mensonge. Le mot potache fait partie du jargon scolaire et fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au coll\u00e9gien ou au lyc\u00e9en.\n\n\n\n\nC\u00e2mera escondida\n\nUma c\u00e2mera escondida, tamb\u00e9m chamada de pegadinha, c\u00e2mera oculta ou apanhados \u00e9 uma situa\u00e7\u00e3o forjada ou verdadeira (que pode ser chamada de brincadeira) pela produ\u00e7\u00e3o de algum programa onde se cria um constrangimento, uma situa\u00e7\u00e3o absurda e inesperada com algu\u00e9m que supostamente ignora a arma\u00e7\u00e3o da qual ser\u00e1 v\u00edtima.\n\nHoje em dia, v\u00e1rios programas de TV se utilizam ou se utilizaram de pegadinhas, dentre eles os de Jo\u00e3o Kl\u00e9ber, S\u00e9rgio Mallandro, Silvio Santos, Gugu Liberato, Fausto Silva , Luciana Gimenez, etc. Nos Estados Unidos, o programa precursor dessa modalidade na televis\u00e3o \u00e9 o Candid Camera, que faz sucesso desde a d\u00e9cada de 1950 at\u00e9 os dias de hoje.\n\nMuitos telespectadores duvidam da veracidade dessas brincadeiras, que de fato, muitas vezes s\u00e3o forjadas a suposta v\u00edtima mas na maioria das vezes as vitimas s\u00e3o atraidas por ofertas tentadoras e pela oportunidade de levar uma grande vantagem, seja ao se aproximar de uma mulher jovem e bonita, ou adquirir algo por um pre\u00e7o irris\u00f3rio .\n\n\n\n\n\u30c9\u30c3\u30ad\u30ea\n\n\u30c9\u30c3\u30ad\u30ea\u3068\u306f\u30d0\u30e9\u30a8\u30c6\u30a3\u756a\u7d44\u306e\u8868\u73fe\u624b\u6cd5\u306e\u3072\u3068\u3064\u3002\u756a\u7d44\u9032\u884c\u3092\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3001\u307e\u305f\u306f\u865a\u507d\u306e\u9032\u884c\u3060\u3051\u77e5\u3089\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u51fa\u6f14\u8005\u3092\u3060\u307e\u3057\u305f\u308a\u30a4\u30bf\u30ba\u30e9\u3092\u4ed5\u639b\u3051\u305f\u308a\u3057\u3066\u3001\u51fa\u6f14\u8005\u306e\u53cd\u5fdc\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u3068\u3044\u3046\u624b\u6cd5\u3002\n\n\n\n\n\nEl texto est\u00e1 disponible bajo la Licencia Creative Commons Atribuci\u00f3n Compartir Igual 3.0\n\nWeb Texto :\n\nhttp://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broma\n\n\n\nWeb Imagenes - Video Con Licencia Atribuci\u00f3n de Creative Commons (reutilizaci\u00f3n permitida) :\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOSrBZl0CYk", "title": "Bromas Pesadas En La Peluqueria Ni\u00f1a Del Exorcista Da Terror A Mujeres - Bromas De Terror Chistosas", "publishedDate": "2014-10-08T12:08:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "8SBRY321Os0", "description": "Sa, 26.

Still, the 22-year-old mother of the two has been told by social services that she is stuck here. \"Perhaps they have not seen this place inside,\" she said. \"They keep telling us to repair it somehow and live here.\" \"They showed me a paper on 'how to build a house'. I told them that I had no funds,\" Elena added. \"I have no job, I have to take care of kids and I ended up renting a place. They said 'It is not our problem'.\" Elena grew up in an orphanage in the city of Tver. Under Russian law she was to receive state housing once she left the institution. The flat proposed to Elena used to belong to her mother, and despite having no money, she has been told to fix it up. The situation is absolutely desperate,\" Elena said. \"They do not give me work because I do not have a profession. For them I do not exist.

They bind the TNF alpha and neutralize it.

This muscle is called the multifidus.  \n\nWhat happens is that when you are engaging this muscle it actually makes your core work stronger.  So your core is going to engage much better while this muscle is activated.\n\nIt's very simple to activate and and there's a great little way that I want to show you when and how.  The muscle runs right along the entire spine, all the way through the cervical spine and up until there.   It's this long muscle which goes all the way along the spine.\n\nTo activate it , you simply want to lengthen your spine.  So if you imagine you've got a piece of string attached to the crown of the head and somebody is lifting you up by the piece of string, you're lengthening your spine. \n\nYou're making it grow nice and long.\n\nFor the test, what I would like you to do is sit down, place your fingers on either side of your spine.  It can be anywhere along your spine.\n\nBut it would be easier to fill up three of the lumber.  So place your fingers on the spine-- either side of the spine.\n\nNow what I want you to do is just latch.  You should feel nice and soft either side of the spine.  You shouldn't feel any muscles engaging.\n\nNow I want you to feel like lengthening up.  Like somebody is lifting you from a piece of string attached to the crown of the head.\n\nYou should feel two muscles on either side of the spine lengthening or switching on.  Not sure if you can see it from there.  So what you want to do whenever you're exercising, running, rolling.  Whatever it is you're doing.  You want to think about lengthening your spine so that your core can engage nice and strong.\n\nNow just doing this one, lengthen your spine and then lean forward.    You'll feel how strong these muscles engage how much they fire up.  That lengthening forward keeping your spine nice and straight when you do that, they engage again.  But, if you were to hunch over, they switch off.\n\nIf you were to lengthen and lay back you'll notice that they switch off as well.  So, that's were the correct posture becomes very very important.  You want to make sure you're not leaning back.\n\nIf you were riding a bike for instance. Obviously not a road bike.  Just a normal bike, you don't want to be leaning back, otherwise you won't have any support with the multifidus muscle or your core as well.\n\nMake sure that when you're lengthening you're either upright or you're lengthening your spine and you're leaning forward over the bike.\n\nSo, it's a great little test for you to do if you sit down, feel either side of the spine and have a play with your posture.\n\nIf you're leaning back you'll feel it switch off, when you lean forward you feel it very very strong, and if you're lengthening that way too it will engage as well.\n\nBut, slumping forward with that poor posture you're not going to have any support and your core won't be able to engage very well.\n\n\n \nContact Us:\n0434 402 776\nsupport@pilatesinnerstrength.com.au\n\nSTUDIO 1:\nLevel 1 / 155\nKing William Road\nHyde Park SA 5061\n\nSTUDIO 2:\nShop 3, 54-56\nKing William Road\nGoodwood SA 5061\n\nClient Testimonials:\nhttp://www.pilatesinnerstrength.com.au/adelaide-clinical-pilates-studio-testimonials/\n\nAbout Us:\nhttp://www.pilatesinnerstrength.com.au/adelaide-pilates/\n\nRehabilitation Pilates:\nhttp://www.pilatesinnerstrength.com.au/individualised-pilates-classes/\n\nGoogle Plus:\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/b/104913119507116905678/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pilatesandbarre", "title": "Pilates Anatomy Lesson - How To Lengthen Your Spine", "publishedDate": "2014-01-04T09:34:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Su1bQ4Ugjo", "description": "Maddi Jane - Barricade - Lyrics", "title": "Maddi Jane - Barricade - Lyrics", "publishedDate": "2012-06-01T11:56:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Su3BVVaCiY", "description": "Maxie 20/07/2012", "title": "Maxie nghi\u00eam tr\u1ecb Ba", "publishedDate": "2012-07-20T19:47:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8SueBAs7h1g", "description": "Bobby talks about how Jehovah's Witnesses define the person Jesus Christ.", "title": "230.
