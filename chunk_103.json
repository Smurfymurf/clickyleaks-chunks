The groundbreaking vehicle can travel up to 300 miles on a single tank of hydrogen, refuel in less than five minutes and emits only water vapor.\n\nExpanded Support for New Hydrogen Stations\n\nOf course, the car of the future won\u2019t become a reality without the hydrogen stations to support it. That\u2019s why Toyota North America chief executive officer (CEO) Jim Lentz announced a new commitment to drive the development of a hydrogen refueling infrastructure in five northeastern U.S. states.\n\nTo support Mirai\u2019s introduction to the region in 2016, Toyota is collaborating with Air Liquide to develop and supply a phased network of 12 state-of-the-art hydrogen stations targeted for New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. The states and locations have been strategically selected in the greater New York and Boston areas to provide the backbone of a hydrogen highway for the Northeast corridor. Specific details of the collaboration will be revealed in the coming months.\n\n\u201cToyota\u2019s vision of a hydrogen society is not just about building a great car, but ensuring accessible, reliable and convenient refueling for our customers,\u201d said Jim Lentz. \u201cI am happy to announce that this vision will expand beyond the borders of California and give customers the opportunity to join the fuel cell movement.\u201d\n\nThis new announcement builds on Toyota\u2019s previous support for hydrogen infrastructure development in California. In May 2014, Toyota announced a $7.3 million loan to FirstElement Fuels to support the operations and maintenance of 19 hydrogen fueling stations across the state. The commitment augments funding provided by the California Energy Commission, and makes Toyota the only OEM to provide working capital for infrastructure development.\n \n\nTRANSCRIPT OF AKIO TOYODA\u2019S ANNOUNCEMENT VIDEO\n\nToday, we are at a turning point in automotive history.\n \nA turning point where people will embrace a new, environmentally-friendly car that is a pleasure to drive.\n\nA turning point where a four-door sedan can travel 300 miles on a single tank of hydrogen, can be refueled in under five minutes and emit only water vapor.\n\nA turning point that represents many years and countless hours of work by our team to create a car that redefines the industry.\n\nAll of us at Toyota believe in a future that will be safer, greener and easier for everyone.\n\nWe imagined a world filled with vehicles that would diminish our dependence on oil and reduce harm to the environment.\n\nIt was a bold, but inspiring goal. And, today it is a reality.\n\nOur fuel cell vehicle runs on hydrogen that can be made from virtually anything, even garbage! \n\nIt has a fuel cell that creates enough electricity to power a house for about a week.\n\nThis is a car that lets you have it all with no compromises.\n\nAs a test driver, I knew this new fuel cell vehicle had to be truly fun to drive \u2013 and believe me, it is. It has a low center of gravity, which gives it very dynamic handling.\n\nAfter surviving millions of miles on the test track and 10 years of testing on public roads in freezing cold and scorching heat\u2026\n\nAfter passing extensive crash tests\u2026\n\nAnd after working with local governments and researchers around the world to help make sure it is easy and convenient to refuel\u2026\n\nWe are ready to deliver.\n\nThe name we\u2019ve given to our new car is Mirai, which in Japanese means \u201cfuture.\u201d\n\nWe believe that behind the wheel of the Mirai, we can go places we have never been, to a world that is better, in a car that is better.\n \nFor us, this isn\u2019t just another car. This is an opportunity \u2013 an opportunity to really make a difference. And making a difference is what Toyota is all about.\n\nThe future has arrived. And it\u2019s called Mirai.\n\nFind us on https://www.facebook.com/pages/Carwp/505636076134244\nRoyalty Free Music by http://audiomicro.com/royalty-free-music\nSound Effects by http://audiomicro.com/sound-effects", "title": "DRIVING 2016 Toyota Mirai @ Fuel Cell Vehicle", "publishedDate": "2014-11-18T13:22:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5UQn0RDlhxA", "description": "Enjoy the video?

His difficulty is majorly due to having a nearly flawless A.I. that practically predicts your inputs, along with being quite broken. He is so hard that only a few in the world have ever beaten him. So hard that most of the staff got fired for the game (and cause it wasn't successful). So difficult that his level had to be reduced in an updated version of the game called Dan-Ku-Ga to lessen a players grief. Even fighting game world champions couldn't beat him. Here is proof:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aod5YACZ5vI\n\nAlong with being the hardest, he is also one of the most broken as well. Hanging along with the likes of: Igniz, Ivan Ooze, Parace L'Sia and The Eternal Champions. Now what makes him so broken is that he is safe on EVERYTHING he does. His teleportation gives him invincibility and could lead a kara grab cancel (which has a huge grab box). He has an omni-directional projectile travelling all three ways across the screen and move or block once he does it. His normals give you a ridiculous amount of stun that lead to an easy infinite and dizzying. His sweep can be done infinitely for an easy block string. Long story short...

When larvae consume nicotine-replete plants, their midgut-expressed cytochrome P450 6B46 (CYP6B46) is upregulated. The larvae in which CYP6B46 is silenced by plant-mediated RNAi excrete more of their ingested nicotine. Silencing CYP6B46 impairs the mechanisms of passing ingested nicotine from the midgut to the hemolymph to be exhaled from the spiracles during spider attack. Spiders are deterred by this nicotine-rich halitosis. Thus, the CYP6B46-silenced larvae exhale less nicotine and become ready spider prey, demonstrating that CYP6B46 functions to repurpose the normally excreted nicotine for defense.\n\nAbstract\nManduca sexta (Ms) larvae are known to efficiently excrete ingested nicotine when feeding on their nicotine-producing native hostplant, Nicotiana attenuata. Here we describe how ingested nicotine is co-opted for larval defense by a unique mechanism. Plant-mediated RNAi was used to silence a midgut-expressed, nicotine-induced cytochrome P450 6B46 (CYP6B46) in larvae consuming transgenic N. attenuata plants producing MsCYP6B46 dsRNA. These and transgenic nicotine-deficient plants were planted into native habitats to study the phenotypes of larvae feeding on these plants and the behavior of their predators. The attack-behavior of a native wolf spider (Camptocosa parallela), a major nocturnal predator, provided the key to understanding MsCYP6B46's function: spiders clearly preferred CYP6B46-silenced larvae, just as they had preferred larvae fed nicotine-deficient plants. MsCYP6B46 redirects a small amount (0.65%) of ingested nicotine from the midgut into hemolymph, from which nicotine is exhaled through the spiracles as an antispider signal. CYP6B46-silenced larvae were more susceptible to spider-attack because they exhaled less nicotine because of lower hemolymph nicotine concentrations. CYP6B46-silenced larvae were impaired in distributing ingested nicotine from midgut to hemolymph, but not in the clearing of hemolymph nicotine or in the exhalation of nicotine from hemolymph. MsCYP6B46 could be a component of a previously hypothesized pump that converts nicotine to a short-lived, transportable, metabolite. Other predators, big-eyed bugs, and antlion larvae were insensitive to this defense. Thus, chemical defenses, too toxic to sequester, can be repurposed for defensive functions through respiration as a form of defensive halitosis, and predators can assist the functional elucidation of herbivore genes.", "title": "Tobacco hornworm found to use nicotine to create 'defensive halitosis' (s1)", "publishedDate": "2014-01-01T17:26:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Ua4QC-bKcU", "description": "Welcome to the 2012, Wheelbase Magazine Product Review for the Sector 9 \"Butterballs\" slide formula wheel.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "crazy guy eats a living octopus in korea", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T20:56:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "5UhNF1ZdLWU", "description": "Cranberry & urinary tract health goes hand in hand.

Februar 2011\n\nKamera & Schnitt: Julia Elger\n\nWessen Wahrheit ist die richtige: Die des einzelnen Menschen, der sein Leben selbst bestimmt und verantwortlich leben m\u00f6chte? Oder wei\u00df die Gemeinschaft, was dem Zusammenleben der Menschen zutr\u00e4glich ist und an welche Gesetze sich alle halten m\u00fcssen, um ein friedliches Miteinander zu erm\u00f6glichen? In der Moderne sind die Beispiele zahlreich f\u00fcr die Fehler von beiden Seiten. Irregeleitete V\u00f6lker glauben ihr Weltbild mit Gewalt durchsetzen zu k\u00f6nnen. Einzelne T\u00e4ter sehen sich zur Rettung der Welt auserw\u00e4hlt und radikalisieren sich bis zur Selbstzerst\u00f6rung. Es muss Rettung kommen, doch wehe dem, durch den sie kommt. Dieser Glaube ist seit der christlichen Erl\u00f6sungsreligion die Antwort auf die Frage nach den Wegen der Wahrheit. Das st\u00e4ndige Ringen zwischen dem Einzelnen und den Vielen, zwischen der \u00dcberzeugung und der Mehrheit, zwischen dem Gef\u00fchl und der Macht bestimmt den gesellschaftlichen Prozess. Im Aufeinandertreffen zweier gleichberechtigter Positionen sah Hegel das Genie der Trag\u00f6die. Sie m\u00fcssen aneinander untergehen und in diesem Untergang zeigen sie die Wahrheit des menschlichen Daseins.\nIn \u00bbAntigone\u00ab wird dieser tragische Riss als Familiengeschichte dargestellt. Die vier Kinder von \u00d6dipus und Iokaste sind nach der Selbstentdeckung ihres Vaterbruders tief verunsichert. Sie sollen die Macht \u00fcbernehmen und finden nur eine haltlose Konstruktion. Der eine Bruder soll herrschen und nach einer bemessenen Frist diese Macht an den anderen Bruder \u00fcbergeben. Als die Zeit zum Wechsel kommt, will Eteokles die Macht nicht hergeben. Polyneikes verb\u00fcndet sich mit fremden Herrschern, um gegen seine eigene Stadt in den Krieg zu ziehen. Der Kampf verl\u00e4uft siegreich f\u00fcr die Verteidiger der Stadt, die beiden Br\u00fcder t\u00f6ten sich gegenseitig. Kreon, der neu eingesetzte Vertreter der Macht, bestimmt, dass der eine Bruder, Eteokles, beerdigt werden soll, der andere hingegen, der Angreifer Polyneikes, vor den Mauern der Stadt unbeweint verwesen muss. Die Schwestern Antigone und Ismene h\u00f6ren von diesem Urteil, das einen Keil in ihre Liebe und Trauer zu den Br\u00fcdern treibt. Antigone will den versto\u00dfenen Bruder beerdigen, Ismene will keine weiteren Konflikte, die ihre Familie der Gewalt aussetzen. Antigone ist nun allein und beginnt ihren Kampf gegen die Stadt.\n\n\nMit: Christoph Gawenda, Tilman Strau\u00df\nMusik: Kante (Thomas Leboeg, Michael M\u00fchlhaus, Felix M\u00fcller, Peter Thiessen, Sebastian Vogel)", "title": "\u00bbAntigone\u00ab Trailer der Schaub\u00fchne Berlin", "publishedDate": "2011-02-02T10:55:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "5UmLVKmkX4I", "description": "Cod 4 trailer , yummm . all recored in 1 day .", "title": "Cod 4 Ily Trailer - Legerity", "publishedDate": "2011-03-05T07:14:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5UmPenma3lw", "description": "Ca\u00f1o Grulla Amazonas Venezuela.

Even after installing a back-valve to prevent raw untreated sewage from backing up into my home. The next day (March 18th, 2013) B&D Plumbing showed up early to hep with the problem, and B&D Employee Brian, quickly found the problem. He pulled the man-hole cover and to both of our surprise we found at 4 foot deep by 5 foot wide pile of raw sewage that was filling up the line and preventing our toilets from flowing one-way as the back-valve was intended to do.\n\nI called 2 on your side, the local news channel, and they did a story on this chapter of my sewage problem, or should I say my fight with the city to correct the problem.\n\nOn this particular occasion, it was piled up raw sewage mixed with medical waste, blood, and other diseases that are found in raw sewage waste from the neighborhood. What channel 2 didn't report is that this problem occurs every time it rains real hard. It's called surcharge when the sewage lines get filled with heavy amounts of rain water and it flows into the sewage lines. This overflow finds it's ways into our homes, and to local canals, rivers, and larger bodies of water, untreated because the surcharge over powered the sewage pump station where by federal law, the raw sewage is supposed to be treated and then release back into the Mississippi or other local bodies of water.\n\nSo for over twenty years, every time it rains hard, this surcharge of raw untreated sewage has been polluting all of our local water ways. Polluting to the point that the EPA & The State of Louisiana filed suit years ago against the city of Baton Rouge.

Los primeros europeos en observar estas aves del Hemisferio Sur fueron exploradores ib\u00e9ricos, que las llamaron p\u00e1jaros ni\u00f1o o p\u00e1jaros bobos por su andar torpe y erguido y al ser un ave incapaz de volar. Poco m\u00e1s tarde, cuando los primeros brit\u00e1nicos vieron a estos animales los llamaron penguins (del ga\u00e9lico penwyn, pen = cabeza y qwyn = blanca), que era el nombre que daban al alca gigante del Atl\u00e1ntico norte (Pinguinus impennis). Sin embargo y pese a las aparentes similitudes resultado de la convergencia evolutiva, los ping\u00fcinos del Hemisferio Norte no est\u00e1n relacionados con los del Hemisferio Sur. Tras la extinci\u00f3n del alca gigante a fines del siglo XIX, el nombre ping\u00fcino se perpetu\u00f3 en las aves de la familia Spheniscidae. Existen 18 diferentes especies de ping\u00fcinos.\n\nLos ping\u00fcinos son las \u00fanicas aves vivientes no voladoras adaptadas al buceo propulsado por las alas. Por ello, sus alas se han convertido en aletas con huesos fuertemente comprimidos y articulaciones r\u00edgidas que impiden el movimiento independiente de los huesos del ala. Los huesos son m\u00e1s densos que los de otras aves, aumentando su resistencia a los impactos y aumentando tambi\u00e9n el peso del ave reduciendo su flotabilidad. Las patas est\u00e1n situadas muy atr\u00e1s en el cuerpo, dificultando el desplazamiento en tierra pero actuando como timones bajo el agua. Los ping\u00fcinos son capaces de alcanzar velocidades de hasta 60 km/h, aunque su velocidad normal oscila entre 5 y 10 km/h. El tiempo de inmersi\u00f3n aumenta en base al tama\u00f1o de la especie, siendo el emperador (Aptenodytes forsteri) el que contiene m\u00e1s tiempo la respiraci\u00f3n: unos 18 minutos. Las principales reservas de ox\u00edgeno durante estos periodos se encuentran no en forma de oxigeno pulmonar, sino que se halla captado en la musculatura que contiene altas cantidades de mioglobina.\nLos ping\u00fcinos son capaces de retener la mayor parte de su calor corporal y esta adaptaci\u00f3n les permite habitar las regiones m\u00e1s fr\u00edas. Su plumaje consta de tres capas, poseen una capa de grasa bajo la piel y un sistema de vasos sangu\u00edneos especializados en las aletas y patas que tempera estas regiones expuestas del cuerpo. Estas adaptaciones son tan efectivas en la conservaci\u00f3n del calor que las especies que viven en regiones templadas suelen sobrecalentarse, para lo cual poseen sus propias adaptaciones, tales como la existencia de \u00e1reas de piel desnuda en el rostro, aletas m\u00e1s largas y patas que act\u00faan como radiadores. Igualmente pasan la mayor parte de su tiempo en el agua fr\u00eda. Otra adaptaci\u00f3n t\u00e9rmica se relaciona con el tama\u00f1o, ya que las especies templadas son en general peque\u00f1as (el ping\u00fcino de las Gal\u00e1pagos es el m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o del g\u00e9nero Spheniscus) lo que les ayuda a disipar el calor m\u00e1s velozmente que a las especies de mayor tama\u00f1o.\n\nMas informacion en wikipedia o fotos en http://www.masfotografias.com", "title": "Autopista acuatica de pinguinos", "publishedDate": "2011-04-16T07:53:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "5V-k-p4wzxg", "description": "In drama, two characters walk into a room.

In this video, DisneyCarToys reviews her childhood wooden dollhouse. This doll house was made from a wooden doll house kit several years ago. In my Calico Critter figurine collection, I have mostly rabbits both adult Sylvanian Families Calico Critters, kids and babies. The baby Calico Critters are adorable! I have rabbits, ducks, kittens, hedgehogs, mice and cat animal babies. The Sylvanian Families Calico Critter figurines in my collection are: Calico Critters Cottontail Rabbit Family, gray rabbit family, brown rabbit family, white rabbit family Sylvanian Families. The wooden doll house is from the 1990s and is decorated for Christmas. The wooden dollhouse kit came in 3 separate pieces and came wood color and so I had to paint it and add the wall paper and carpet myself. My favorite room in the house is the indoor / outdoor room with the artificial turf. This house is small enough for Calico Critter toys, but not big enough for Barbies.

Many people are aware that the Honda GX series of 4-stroke OHV horizontal shaft engines are excellent engines. They are a wonderful design that provides great performance, fuel efficiency, and reliability. They are also expensive. However the chinese clones of these Honda GX engines are not expensive - $160 or less when on sale! The truth is that these clones are truly clones and perform just like the Honda. All of the parts interchange with the Honda. This makes sense because the honda engines are also made in china. Needless to say, these clones are now extremely poplular - especially the 196cc, (6.5hp) ones. I purchase mine from my local princess auto store and they are black in color. These Honda clone engines are referred to by many names but those most frequently encountered are: Honda clone, 6.5 HP clone, blue engine, yellow engine, and box-stock engine. These honda clones are now so popular that many go-kart tracks around the country now have an affordable racing class in which all of the karts competing in this class must use an un-modified 196cc 6.5 HP Honda clone engine. They call this class the box-stock class or blue-engine class. Many here know that these 6.5hp clones also make great minibike engines. They work especially well as a replacement for a tired B&S or Tecumseh flat-head (side-valve) engine.\n\nThanks for Watching Rate and Comment!", "title": "Honda Margay Go-Kart (Before Update)", "publishedDate": "2008-08-19T20:18:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "5VBQOiQC-jk", "description": "Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance - R-00: Sundowner & Metal Gear Ray, Prime Minister Kidnapped PS3", "title": "Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance - R-00: Sundowner & Metal Gear Ray, Prime Minister Kidnapped PS3", "publishedDate": "2013-02-20T08:45:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "5VBiprElTpE", "description": "Sketch polyn\u00e9sien \u00e0 la TV .", "title": "Papa PUROU va \u00e0 la CPS ....", "publishedDate": "2013-06-06T06:55:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "5VBriRtl_aM", "description": "Check this out right meow.\nPost to Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1k5VgUd\nLike BuzzFeedVideo on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1ilcE7k\nPost to Twitter: http://bit.ly/1k5VkDs\n\nAll media courtesy of AFV\n\nGET MORE BUZZFEED:\nwww.buzzfeed.comwww.buzzfeed.co\u00adm/video\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeed\nwww.youtu\u00adbe.com/buzzfeedvideo\nwww.youtube.com/buzz\u00adfeedyellow\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedpop\nwww\u00ad.youtube.com/cnnbuzzfeed\n\nBUZZFEED VIDEO\n\nBuzzFeed is the world's first true social news organization.

It was suggested in the show that Lyme disease bacteria was accidentally released from the lab and spread to Lyme Connecticut. I think it's definitely probable that something like this could happen, when it's been recorded that outbreaks such as foot and mouth disease have been recorded.\nhttp://youtu.be/Btcfl7MU61U\n\nI mean all it would take is one insect such as a tick to attach itself to a bird and fly inland. Anyone can do their own investigating on this subject, it's no secret that governments have been trying to develop biological warfare weapons.  Fact: In 1942 President Franklin Roosevelt and Secretary of War Henry Stimson ordered the creation of an American biological warfare program.\n\nBut then there's argument well much recently they found a 5,300 year old caveman that had Lyme disease, so we do know the spirochete has been around for a very long time. Well what if there was a scientist that was able to modify the bacteria, making it much more aggressive.  Is that possible?  Well what we are learning is many different species of organisms have been already modified, such as plants, making them more tolerant to bugs and microbes.\nhttp://www2.macleans.ca/2012/02/29/lactose-intolerant-caveman-had-brown-eyes-was-predisposed-to-heart-disease/\n\nErich Traub, a German scientist who was brought to the United States after the US conquered the Soviets supposedly worked at Plum Island. Working with ticks and the Lyme bacteria, that's what a book called Lab 257 suggests.  As the book brings up containment back then was very loose, all it would take is a minor accident and outbreak could possibly happen.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Traub\nhttp://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2007/08/30/lab-257/\n\nAll this is fascinating information, but is it true, do we have enough evidence?  Well even if we did, what could we do about it. There is evidence that Tuskegee airmen were given syphilis, was anyone brought up on trial?  I think a lot of people that are trying to point finger should be protesting the fact that the government isn't doing enough about the current situation with Lyme disease.  But don't get me wrong I don't want to dismiss this history.\n\nIf you recently look on Jesse Ventura's Conspiracy Theory website, there is an archive of some of the new shows coming up.  It looks as if he's doing a show specifically called Lyme Disease Manufactured.  Maybe Jesse might be bringing some new evidence to the table, you definitely should check it out.

It has characteristic loud alarm calls which are variously rendered as did he do it or pity to do it leading to colloquial names like the did-he-do-it bird. Usually seen in pairs or small groups not far from water but may form large flocks in the non-breeding season (winter).\nRed-wattled Lapwings are large waders, about 35 cm long. The wings and back are light brown with a purple sheen, but head and chest and front part of neck are black. Prominently white patch runs between these two colours, from belly and tail, flanking the neck to the sides of crown. Short tail is tipped black. A red fleshy wattle in front of each eye, black-tipped red bill, and the long legs are yellow. In flight, prominent white wing bars formed by the white on the secondary coverts.\nRace aigneri is slightly paler and larger than the nominate race and is found in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Indus valley. The nominate race is found all over India. The Sri Lankan race lankae is smaller and dark while atronuchalis the race in north-eastern India and eastern Bangladesh has a white cheek surrounded by black.\nMales and females are similar in plumage but males have a 5% longer wing and tend to have a longer carpal spur. The length of the birds is 320-350mm, wing of 208-247mm with the nominate averaging 223mm, Sri Lanka 217mm. The Bill is 31-36mm and tarsus of 70-83mm. Tail length is 104-128mm.\nIt usually keeps in pairs or trios in well-watered open country, ploughed fields, grazing land, and margins and dry beds of tanks and puddles. They occasionally form large flocks, ranging from 26 to 200 birds.[7] It is also found in forest clearings around rain-filled depressions. It runs about in short spurts and dips forward obliquely (with unflexed legs) to pick up food in a typical plover manner.[8] They are said to feed at night being especially active around the full moon. Is uncannily and ceaselessly vigilant, day or night, and is the first to detect intrusions and raise an alarm, and was therefore considered a nuisance by hunters. Flight rather slow, with deliberate flaps, but capable of remarkable agility when defending nest or being hunted by a hawk.\nIt breeds from West Asia (Iraq, SW Iran, the Arabian/Persian Gulf) eastwards across South Asia (Baluchistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the entire Indian subcontinent up to Kanyakumari and up to 1800m in Kashmir/Nepal), with another sub-species further east in Southeast Asia. May migrate altitudinally in spring and autumn (e.g. in N. Baluchistan or NW Pakistan), and spreads out widely in the monsoons on creation of requisite habitats, but by and large the populations are resident.\nThis species is declining in its western range, but is abundant in much of South Asia, being seen at almost any wetland habitat in its range.\nThe breeding season is mainly March to August. The courtship involves the male puffing its feathers and pointing its beak upwards. The male then shuffles around the female. Several males may display to females and they may be close together. The eggs are laid in a ground scrape or depression sometimes fringed with pebbles, goat or hare droppings. About 3--4 black-blotched buff eggs shaped a bit like a peg-top (pyriform), 42x30 mm on average. Nests are difficult to find since the eggs are cryptically coloured and usually matches the ground pattern. In residential areas, they sometimes take to nesting on roof-tops. They have been recorded nesting on the stones between the rails of a railway track, the adult leaving the nest when trains passed. Nests that have been threatened by agricultural operations have been manually translocated by gradually shifting the eggs. When nesting they will attempt to dive bomb or distract potential predators. Both the male and female incubate the eggs and divert predators using distraction displays or flash their wings to deter any herbivores that threaten the nest. Males appear to relieve the females incubating at the nest particularly towards the hot part of noon. The eggs hatch in 28 to 30 days. The reproductive success is about 40%. Egg mortality is high (~43%) due to predation by mongooses, crows and kites. Chicks had a lower mortality (8.3%) and their survival improved after the first week.\nThe diet of the lapwing includes a range of insects, snails and other invertebrates, mostly picked from the ground. They may also feed on some grains. They feed mainly during the day but they may also feed at night. They may sometimes make use of the legs to disturb insect prey.\nIn parts of India, a local belief is that the bird sleeps on its back with the legs upwards and an associated Hindi metaphor Tithiri se asman thama jayega (\"can the pee-wit support the heavens?\") is used when referring to persons undertaking tasks beyond their ability or strength.", "title": "Red Wattled Lapwing Bird Hunting After Game", "publishedDate": "2014-06-03T03:56:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "5VH-U5oEr-s", "description": "Beskrivning", "title": "Paranoid (Sweden) Live at K-Town 21/6 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-06-22T15:08:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "5VH4c0-p-CY", "description": "Graham Chapmans fantastic oneliner response to a German guard outside Dachau.

Il leur ordonne alors de se contracter ce qui d\u00e9clenche la pompe cardiaque et fait s'\u00e9couler le sang dans les poumons et \u00e0 travers le corps.\n\nIl arrive qu\u2019un individu pr\u00e9sente des troubles touchant ce syst\u00e8me de conduction, dans ce cas le c\u0153ur se mettra \u00e0 battre trop vite, trop lentement ou de mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re. L'ablation par radiofr\u00e9quence est une intervention m\u00e9dicale qui sert \u00e0 corriger l'arythmie, c'est-\u00e0-dire un rythme cardiaque irr\u00e9gulier.\n\nOn proc\u00e8de tout d'abord \u00e0 des analyses \u00e9lectrophysiologiques afin d'identifier avec pr\u00e9cision la zone du c\u0153ur \u00e0 soigner. On proc\u00e8de ensuite \u00e0 l'intervention en elle-m\u00eame au cours de laquelle on introduit un cath\u00e9ter dans une art\u00e8re de la jambe que l'on remonte jusqu'\u00e0 l'emplacement du c\u0153ur. Une fois le cath\u00e9ter plac\u00e9 dans la zone du c\u0153ur \u00e0 traiter, on \u00e9met des ondes radio par l'interm\u00e9diaire de l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du cath\u00e9ter. Ces ondes vont chauffer et d\u00e9truire le tissu cardiaque qui est responsable de l'anomalie du rythme. Dans la grande majorit\u00e9 de cas, le c\u0153ur retrouve un rythme normal suite \u00e0 cette ablation. Certains patients devront cependant continuer \u00e0 prendre un traitement, voire \u00e0 porter un pacemaker (stimulateur cardiaque).\n\nCette intervention pr\u00e9sente plusieurs complications potentielles que le m\u00e9decin devra exposer \u00e0 chacun des patients avant toute intervention.", "title": "Ablation par radiofr\u00e9quence", "publishedDate": "2014-05-04T00:07:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5VJND9AL7ko", "description": "One of the few first Sampled videos\nAudio Available at:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/freemankamili/courage", "title": "Freeman Kamili - Courage", "publishedDate": "2014-07-04T16:41:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "5VJb8x011c0", "description": "Feeling pretty good today seeing as I had two days of intense bizarreness.

They can change color to match their surroundings. They will also mimic the coral branches by turning their bodies head down into a vertical position to look like a branch of the coral colony. They have varying width vertical pale lines covering their bodies from head to tail with scattered dark spots and a black line at the end of their upper jaw. The tail is narrower and the coloring makes it look like an arrow head. Fortunately for snorkelers, they only grow to a length of 3 feet. I've seen them in water as shallow as 3 feet.

This is a chart that your doctor may ask you to form by you taking a thermometer and every morning when you wake up, you have it on your bedside and you put in your mouth and you measure your temperature. The theory is based on the fact that once a woman ovulates the ovaries start to secrete progesterone and the body's temperature as a result goes up by about half a degree. The good news about this is that if you track yourself you will see your temperature in the first half of your cycle will be a bit lower and then as you plot every day you'll see it rise. We would call it biphasic--two phases. It iis very useful in helping us have an idea that you are ovulating unfortunately. It does not help you get pregnant and it can create a lot of anxiety as you lay there first in the morning with your thermometer under your tongue. \n\nI recommend to my own patients to maybe do it for one of two months.

It is widely distributed; the Egyptian Vulture is found from southwestern Europe and northern Africa to India. In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number 3,300-5,050 breeding pairs, equating to 9,900-15,150 individuals. Europe forms 25-49% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 20,000-61,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 13,000-41,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. The species declining in virtually all parts of its range, apparently for a number of different reasons. In India, it has declined by 90% in the last decade; European populations have declined by 50% over the last three generations, and West, East and southern African populations also appear to have declined significantly, as do Arabian populations (Jennings 2010).\n\nThe contrasting underwing pattern and wedge-shaped tail make it distinctive in flight as it soars in thermals during the warmer parts of the day. Egyptian Vultures feed mainly on carrion but are opportunistic and will prey on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. They also feed on the eggs of other birds, breaking larger ones by tossing a large pebble onto them. The use of tools is rare in birds and apart from the use of a pebble as a hammer, Egyptian Vultures also use twigs to roll up wool for use in their nest. Egyptian Vultures that breed in the temperate regions migrate south in winter while tropical populations are relatively sedentary. Populations of this species have declined in the 20th century and some island populations are endangered by hunting, accidental poisoning, and collision with power lines.\n\nAbout 55-65 cm with a wingspan of155-170 cm, Neophron percnopterus are medium-large. Characteristic flight silhouette with broad, well-fingered wings and a wedge-shaped tail. Yellow face and base to the bill with a black tip. Plumage is pale grey with some buff on the head and neck. Primaries and secondaries are black showing contrast with underwing-coverts below and unique white centres above. Juveniles are largely dark brown with contrasting area of pale buff. Typically nests on ledges or in caves on cliffs, crags and rocky outcrops, but occasionally also in large trees, buildings, electricity pylons and exceptionally on the ground. Forages in lowland and montane regions over open, often arid, country. Also scavenges at human settlements. Broad diet including carrion, tortoises, organic waste, insects, young vertebrates, eggs and even faeces. Usually solitary, but will congregate at feeding sites, such as rubbish tips, or vulture restaurants and forms roosts of non-breeding birds.\n\nPerforms an energetic display flight with mate. Several resident island populations show genetic isolation. Northern breeders conduct long-distance intercontinental migrations, flying over land and often utilising the narrowest part of the Strait of Gibraltar on their way to Africa. The species exhibits high site fidelity, particularly in males. This species faces a number of threats across its range. Disturbance, lead poisoning, direct poisoning, electrocution, collisions with wind turbines, reduced food availability and habitat change are currently impacting upon European populations. Illegal poisoning against carnivores seems to be the main threat operating on the breeding grounds in Spain. Declines in parts of Africa are likely to have been driven by loss of wild ungulate populations and, in some areas, overgrazing by livestock. In Morocco at least, the species is taken for use in traditional medicine. Competition for suitable nest sites with Griffon Vulture may reduce breeding success in the short-term .\n\nSource: www.birdlife.org & Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Somehow it has a lot of uniformity with drugs such as metformin and sulfonylureas ( Diabenese Micro, Amaryl Glynase new treatment for diabetes, DiaBeta and Glucotrol ) . Of these, the most common metformin prescription for diabetes and in use for quite a long time .\n\nWhile the new drugs can not be a substitute for the old ones, they have increased opportunities for people who have difficulty in controlling their blood sugar levels with the normal medications new treatment for diabetes.\n\nIn recent times, older drugs have brought certain side effects associated . As a result, the FDA has restricted the use of Avandia after research showed that it exposed the victims cardiovascular risks . The FDA issued another warning in 2011 for Actos , which falls in the same group of drugs . ACTOS is also connected with an increased risk of cancer of the bladder new treatment for diabetes.\n\nGlucose monitoring and insulin pumps\n\nnew treatment for diabetes\n\nAccording to experts, has made great progress on insulin pumps and glucose monitoring . Constant monitoring of blood glucose using a small sensor reaches inserted into the skin of a medical professional. It sends data via the existing sugar levels to a pager such as wireless - Gadget . The sensor must be replaced after every 3-7 days. This is quite a remarkable feat new treatment for diabetes, considering that was introduced in front of the sensor , the people were required to urinate on a piece of paper to get a rough estimate of their blood sugar levels. But with this amazing glucose monitoring method in place, it is now possible to make a precise update every few minutes.\n\nPeople with type 2 diabetes need insulin injected something to laugh about . This is due to the introduction of fine insulin to provide smaller and more precise doses of insulin. Experts are working on a technology that is completely mechanized cooperation of continuous glucose monitor and insulin pump. This makes pressing the button on the pump when a monitor signals are unnecessary. The monitor will instead be asked to remove the pump , the insulin dose directly . The two will create without the involvement of a patient so what specialists term to work as \"artificial pancreas\" together new treatment for diabetes.\n\nLifestyle changes\n\nFor years it has been that the lifestyle known as diet and exercise are important in the treatment of type 2 diabetes . In fact, carried out in the last decade, studies have further clarified the connection between the two. She pointed out that the aggressive glucose control with lifestyle changes heart disease can reduce risk in diabetics. In most cases new treatment for diabetes, experts recommend that people with diabetes should get weekly exercises of not less than 150 minutes in addition to strength training.\n\nIn terms of food varieties , there is no diabetes diet that can be referred to as one-size- fits-all. Therefore, a person must be both flexible and creative when it comes to choosing a meal plan new treatment for diabetes. Studies show that many people respond very well to low- carbohydrate and Mediterranean food. It is therefore important to have a dietitian who has experience in the treatment of diabetes has to be consulted.

They were all crazy.\n\nIn this episode of Word Origins, we discuss the etymology of the word 'crazy'.\n\nCrazy's etymological roots are somewhat unclear, but a likely origin comes from the Old French word 'acraser' itself a borrowing from Old Norse. 'Acraser,' whose modern form '\u00e9craser' like the older form means to break, shatter, crush or crack, made its way into Middle English as acraze.\n\nThen through a process called aphaeresis the word lost its initial 'a'. Aphaeresis simply refers to the loss of one or more sounds at the beginning of a word, especially in the case of unstressed vowels.\n\nAs an adjective, crazy meant 'having the qualities of a crack or breach' or 'full of cracks'.\n\nLater we started using it for people who were of an unsound or cracked mind.", "title": "Word Origins: Crazy", "publishedDate": "2013-08-20T12:43:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "5VpGR0x0cZk", "description": "A simple Video from a simple skill, \nFor the Love of My father...\nSome Videos taken by my friend Melisa.\nAnd Of course I've used the Playback-Music from Bruno Mars for this Video.\nHope You enjoy this Song \n\nOh [4x]\n\n[Verse 1:]\nWhen I was just a little boy\nBarely strong enough to stand\nI could always count on him\nOh\n\nHe thought me everything I know\nAnd 'till this day it shows\nHe was more than just a friend (Ah ah ah)\n\n[Pre-Chorus:]\nThere were so many times I would doubt myself\nBut his words were always there to help\n\n[Chorus:]\nHow would it be?\nWhere I am?\nIf my father didn't tell me\nTo never say I can't\n\nHe'd carry me\nAnd never let me fall\nOh and the only thing he asked\nRight before he passed\nWas to never say you can't\n\nOh\nNever say you can't\nOh oh oh Oh\n\n[Verse 2:]\nSo when last rain begins to fall\nAnd you're out there on your own\nAnd you can't see a thing\nNo no no\n\nJust find a voice that understands\nFor me it was my old man\nTaught me to say the words I can\nOh\n\n[Pre-chorus:]\nThere were so many times I would doubt myself\nBut his words were always there to help\n\n[Chorus:]\nHow would it be?\nWhere I am?\nIf my father didn't tell me\nTo never say I can't\n\nHe'd carry me\nAnd never let me fall\nOh and the only thing he asked\nRight before he passed\nWas to never say you can't\n\n[Bridge:]\nEverything he taught me would stay with me forever\nNo I won't forget a thing\nOh because of dad I now know myself better\nAnd I hope I can do for him what he did for me\n\n[Chorus:]\nHow would it be?\nWhere I am?\nIf my father didn't tell me\nTo never say I can't\n\nHe'd carry me\nAnd never let me fall\nOh and the only thing he asked\nRight before he passed\nWas to never say you can't\n\nOh\nNever say you can't\nOh\nNever say you can't", "title": "Never Say You Can't -

Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus. Gray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.\n\nSource- Wikipedia.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

The hair of the lion-tailed macaque is black. Its outstanding characteristic is the silver-white mane which surrounds the head from the cheeks down to its chin, which gives this monkey its German name Bartaffe - \"beard ape\". The hairless face is black in colour. With a head-body length of 42 to 61 cm and a weight of 2 to 10 kg, it ranks among the smaller macaques. The tail is medium in length, about 25 cm, and has a black tuft at the end, similar to a lion's tail. The male's tail-tuft is more developed than that of the female.\n\nThe lion-tailed macaque is a diurnal rainforest dweller. It is a good climber and spends a majority of its life in the upper canopy of tropical moist evergreen forests. Unlike other macaques, it avoids humans. In group behavior, it is much like other macaques; it lives in hierarchical groups of usually 10 to 20 animals, which consist of few males and many females. It is a territorial animal, defending its area first with loud cries towards the invading troops. If this proves fruitless, it brawls aggressively.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1980, public concern about the endangered status of lion-tailed macaque became the focal point of Save Silent Valley, India's fiercest environmental debate of the decade. From 1993 to 1996, 14 troops were observed in Silent Valley National Park, Kerala, one of the most undisturbed viable habitats left for them.\n\nThe Western Ghats are home to thousands of animal species including at least 325 globally threatened species. Many are endemic species, especially in the amphibian and reptilian classes. Thirty two threatened species of mammals live in the Western Ghats. Of the 16 endemic mammals, 13 are threatened.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

The inflorescence consists of either an umbellate cluster of flowers or a lax raceme, with internodes occurring between generally paired flowers.Species of Nymphoides are sold as aquarium plants, including the \"banana plant\", N. aquatica and the \"water snowflake\", N. indica. Species native to the United States are N. cordata in the northeast and N. aquatica in the southeast. Nymphoides peltata is native to Europe and Asia, but can be found in the United States as an invasive aquatic weed.

Well, basically the word congenital means any condition you're born with. In general, the condition arises from a genetic abnormality. That means one we get from our parent's genes. The most common manifestation of congenital heart disease would be a structural problem with the heart, that is, the way the heart's built. And it may show up as a weakened heart muscle, abnormal function of the heart valves, or things in the heart that are positioned not in the usual way. \n\nIt is usually recognized early in childhood by either the pediatrician or a pediatrician who refers a child to a pediatric cardiologist. And they often do various types of testing. The most basic of which would be listening to the heart with a stethoscope, and then often followed by an ultrasound of the heart to image the heart and get pictures of how the heart is functioning and how the heart is built. \n\nSo congenital heart disease varies. It's a pretty big spectrum. On one side, it can be pretty minor variations of the heart anatomy or function, with which patients can do very well for many, many years. On the other side of the spectrum, it can be life threatening early on, and infants can often not survive unless treated early. Most of that treatment would involve surgical procedures. \n\nOn the severe end of the spectrum, most infants would require surgery to help correct the anomaly and help the heart function normally. The good news is that we've made a lot of progress with congenital heart disease, and oftentimes, our young kids with congenital heart disease are growing up to be healthy adults who live long and healthy lives. And that would be a brief overview of congenital heart disease.", "title": "What Is Congenital Heart Disease? | Heart Disease", "publishedDate": "2013-08-22T19:52:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "5We_kaeKf3c", "description": "Well, it's been a long time since my last video.

[It is contained also in their album \"Super Euro Party\" (March 2006).] This song was used as the ending theme of Japanese Anime \"Ichigo 100%\" (April--June 2005). It is a cover version of the original song by Tri-Star that is contained in Vol. 1 (September 1999) of \"EUROMACH\" (a series of Eurobeat compilation albums released from \"cutting edge\").\n\nThis is a video of their live performance. It is surprising that their singing is scarcely disturbed by hard dancing. For this reason some people suspect that they are doing lip sync. But it is not true. If you compare it with the singing recorded in the disc, you'll realize that this is the entirely different singing from that. We can confirm it by finding their slight vibration of voice at 1:20-24 along with the movement of dancing. They are REALLY SINGING on this stage (though the back chorus and instrumental accompaniment are recorded ones).\n\nSome people wrote on the comment boards for other videos of \"IKE IKE\" by HINOI Team that the instrumental accompaniment of this song was very similar to that of \"We Like to Party\" (1998) by Vengaboys. I think it isn't coincidence, because in a later version of this song by Tri-Star the words \"We Like to Party\" appear before the singing begins. The similarity is intentional. For \"IKE IKE\" is a song that represents the feelings of a girl who is going to dance \"Party\" (if we may call a discotheque a place for \"Party\"). \n\nThe CDs (single \"IKE IKE\" and album \"Super Euro Party\") containing  this song are  available in Japan even now. If you live in the other country, you can buy them at REASONABLE prices through internet from \"YesAsia\". Search it. You can buy it also from Amazon, but the prices of imported CDs at Amazon are too high.\n\n\n[English Translation of the Lyrics]\n\nGo, Go (IKE IKE)\n\n\n[1]\nFascinate me. Love needs courage and charm.\nWatch me. The remainder will be the course of events.\n\nLet's prepare our hearts properly.\nWith sexy dance rather than 8 beat. HA! HA! HA! HA?\nAs we supposed,\nIt sparkles. Look !\nThis is the power of Angel.\n\n[2]\nGo, Go, happy night! I want only to be carried away.\nGo, Go, heat up further! Feel the power.\nLet's enjoy the impulse to dance. wow wow.\nGo, Go, forever. It never ends.\nGo, Go, party time! Until the dawn.\nThe time of youth is only now when we are free. yeah! yeah!\nGo, Go!\n\n[3]\nLOVE is to love oneself.\nLOVE is very profound.\n\nWe can't get it by only desiring it.\nNow, I can't help doing.\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nI won't regret.\nWith all my heart,\nAs much as I can,\n\n[4]\nGo, Go. Our feelings come to be one.\nGo, Go, more powerfully! Feel the power.\nThe winner is anyone who enjoys the passion to dance. wow wow.\nGo, Go, forever. It never changes.\nGo, Go, party time! It continues everlastingly.\nThe time of youth leads to shining future. yeah! yeah!\nGo, Go!\n\n(repeat [2])", "title": "HINOI Team - IKE IKE (English subbed)", "publishedDate": "2009-05-30T07:41:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "5WgUKqGrjzY", "description": "La animadora deslumbr\u00f3 con un vestido de Claudio Mancilla en la gala de Primer Plano y adelant\u00f3 la elegancia que lucir\u00e1 en la pr\u00f3xima edici\u00f3n del Festival de Vi\u00f1a. \n\nCap\u00edtulo 29 de julio de 2014.", "title": "Carolina de Moras mostr\u00f3 su belleza con un elegante vestido - PRIMER PLANO", "publishedDate": "2014-08-30T05:55:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "5WgUktfdDy4", "description": "The Red Dwarf team get their best personality traits removed by a Polymorph.\n\nSubscribe to Comedy Greats for more hilarious videos: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=BBCComedyGreats", "title": "The Meeting - Red Dwarf - BBC", "publishedDate": "2007-07-19T20:18:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "5WgX_pODaZs", "description": "The first single from the upcoming debut EP from The Greenery Commons - Precarious.

You have to warn your leaders that they will be forced to do this by their own people. The people will force your leaders to retire, because they are nothing more than puppets of US policy. Unfortunately, today there are no such leaders as Charles de Gaulle, who gave direction to his people to lead a sovereign policy. It's about time the guidelines of the EU Member States stop this humiliating, vassal policy towards Washington. The leaders should lead their own policy, in the interests of their own countries, and if they don't do this they will suffer. If they continue to follow the sick ambitions of Washington and play the American game, that will draw us into war.\"\nC/U Voting machine\n\nSCRIPT\n\nVolen Siderov, Chairman of the Attack Party, addressed his fellow deputies on the opening of the 43rd National Assembly in Sofia on Monday.

And the main problem with driving in these conditions is that our visibility is not as good as it's going to be on a nice, sunny day. By driving in rain, it's going to cut down on the visibility around our vehicle. The first thing we have to remember to do is to put our windshield wipers during the rain. When you put the windshield wipers on, this will clean our window if our wiper blades are clean. So we have to make sure we change the blades. Keep them new so that when we turn them on, it's going to clean the windshield in a proper manner. \n\nThe second thing is, when you put the wiper blades on you want to make sure you turn on your headlights. It's law in most states that when the wipers go on, the headlights must also go on. So you have to get a situation where your wipers and headlights are used together, increasing your effectiveness during driving in the rain.\n\nThe second problem with driving in rain might be a condition called hydroplaning. And what that means is that when it first starts to rain, what the rain does is it loosens the oils that might be on the roadway. The oils will float up, and therefore your car might be in a situation where it's sitting on top of oil. It's not actually sitting on the roadway. What do you do if this situation happens? You generally just slow down, let that car settle down. It will therefore grab the roadway again, and then you'll be able to safely operate your vehicle.\n\nThe next thing I want to talk about is driving in fog. And basically what's going to happen in a fog situation is that you're not going to be able to see far ahead of the vehicle. Also if your lights are on during the fog, the glare from the headlight is going to come right back into your eyes, therefore making driving more dangerous. So in the fog, again, you want to use low beams not high beams. The high beam will come right back toward you. You want to keep your low beams on, and you want to try to look down and drive slower. The slower you drive, the better it's going to be, because you're not going to be able to see well in either rain or fog.\n\nSo that would be the best tip I could give you for driving in those situations. Just drive a little bit slower, therefore being able to compensate for the poor visibility in rain or in fog.", "title": "How to Drive in Rain or Fog | Driving Lessons", "publishedDate": "2013-07-24T03:49:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "5WrJqbtA9NI", "description": "Tarabilla com\u00fan hembra.

Ea continea doar estrogen artificial si efectul ei consta practic in a pacali corpul femeii si a-l face sa \"creada\" ca este deja insarcinata.\n\nIn mod natural, ovarele femeii produc cantitati mari de estrogen in timpul sarcinii, impiedicand eliberarea ovulului de catre ovare. Insa, concentratia mare de estrogen din pilulele contraceptive produse multe femei suferind: atacuri vasculare, infarct, atacuri cerebrale.\n\nProducatorii de contraceptive au micsorat dozele de estrogen de la initial 150 micrograme per pilula, la 30 sau chiar 20 mcg, dozaj mentinut si in prezent. Micsorarea dozajului a redus efectele secundare, insa a marit cu mult frecventa ovulatiei \"accidentale\". Ca urmare, producatorii de contraceptive au adaugat progesteron sintetic estrogenului din pilula.\n\nProgesteronul artificial are doua efecte:\n\nIn primul rand, mareste vascozitatea mucusului cervical, ingreunand inaintarea spermatozoizilor spre ovul.\n\nIn al doilea rand, progesteronul atrofiaza vasele de sange din peretii uterului. Astfel ca, daca vreun spermatozoid ajunge totusi la ovul, si il fecundeaza, embrionul format nu are unde sa se implanteze, si este eliminat o data cu sangele menstrual. Din acest motiv, pilula contraceptiva functioneaza si ca un AVORTIV.\n\nAcesta este un lucru pe care producatorii de contraceptive nu-l scriu in prospecte si nici nu-l spun in reclame sau emisiuni mass-media. Asadar, rostul acestui spot este sa informeze populatia care este ADEVARUL si sa aminteasca ce se intampla de fapt in momentul fecundarii.\n\nIata, cei 23 de cromozomi din spermatozoid si cei 23 de cromozomi din ovul se descompun si se recombina, pentru a forma un singur set. Aceasta combinatie unica de 46 de cromozomi devine apoi \"tiparul\" pentru toate celulele noii fapturi umane. Nu poate fi identificata precis frecventa situatiilor in care pilula contraceptiva pricinuieste de fapt AVORT. Totusi, femeile care iau contraceptive orale declara ca in unele zile uita sa ia pilula, sau ca nu respecta intocmai orarul de administrare. Rezultatul este o rata de esec de 3 pana la 5% in preintampinarea ovulatiei.\n\nDaca 3 - 5% dintre femeile care iau contraceptive orale raporteaza ca au ramas insarcinate, oare cat de mare este numarul celor care au ovulatie in ciuda utilizarii contraceptivelor?

This process involves two distinct pathways for processing of antigens from an organism's own (self) proteins or intracellular pathogens (e.g. viruses), or from phagocytosed pathogens (e.g. bacteria); subsequent presentation of these antigens on class I or class II MHC molecules is dependent on which pathway is used. Both MHC class I and II are required to bind antigen before they are stably expressed on a cell surface. The endogenous pathway is used to present cellular peptide fragments on the cell surface on MHC class I molecules. If a virus had infected the cell, viral peptides would also be presented, allowing the immune system to recognize and kill the infected cell. Worn out proteins within the cell become ubiquitinated, marking them for proteasome degradation. The exogenous pathway is utilized by professional antigen presenting cells to present peptides derived from proteins that the cell has endocytosed. The peptides are presented on MHC class II molecules. Proteins are endocytosed and degraded by acid-dependent proteases in endosomes; this process takes about an hour.", "title": "Antigen presenting cells, Rate My Science", "publishedDate": "2012-05-04T00:06:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Wutfddb6UE", "description": "1/18/14.

As part of a campaign to conquer all of China, the Japanese subjected Nanking - which was then China's capital - to months of aerial bombardment, and when the city fell, the Japanese army unleashed murder and rape on a horrifying scale. In the midst of the rampage, a small group of Westerners banded together to establish a Safety Zone where over 200,000 Chinese found refuge. Unarmed, these missionaries, university professors, doctors and businessmen - including a Nazi named John Rabe - bore witness to the events, while risking their own lives to protect civilians from slaughter. The story is told through deeply moving interviews with Chinese survivors, chilling archival footage and photos of the events, and testimonies of former Japanese soldiers. At the heart of NANKING is a filmed stage reading of the Westerners' letters and diaries, featuring Woody Harrelson, Mariel Hemingway and Jurgen Prochnow. Through its interweave of archival images, testimonies of survivors, and readings of first hand accounts, the film puts the viewer on the streets of Nanking and brings the forgotten past to startling life. NANKING is a testament to the courage and conviction of individuals who were determined to act in the face of evil and a powerful tribute to the resilience of the Chinese people - a gripping account of light in the darkest of times.", "title": "Nanking Trailer", "publishedDate": "2013-12-11T22:37:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "5X-yWc7YcTM", "description": "accidente de autos (TODOCHOQUESS)", "title": "accidente de autos (TODOCHOQUESS).", "publishedDate": "2012-01-26T16:46:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "5X0C5ccJhME", "description": "Pole paintballowe Mindoro w Szlach\u0119cinie, \nfilmik jeszcze nie zmontowany, jest to tylko wersja do testowania jako\u015bci odtwarzania.", "title": "Paintball Mindoro z lotu ptaka demo", "publishedDate": "2013-09-20T09:03:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "5X0IGufgYdQ", "description": "How to Cut up Old Tires for Disposal or Projects.\nThis is the fastest way to cut up old tires for disposal or if you want to use part of the rubber for any other DIY projects.

Contudo, esse teste psicol\u00f3gico est\u00e1 com parecer desfavor\u00e1vel pelo CFP desde 2012, portanto n\u00e3o pode ser aplicado, pois seus resultados n\u00e3o s\u00e3o mais v\u00e1lidos. O Teste consiste na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de tra\u00e7os e desenhos (linhas, c\u00edrculos, \"zigue-zagues\", retas paralelas) feitos com l\u00e1pis para a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da personalidade. Em alguns estados do Brasil, este teste foi necess\u00e1rio para se obter a Carteira Nacional de Habilita\u00e7\u00e3o para ser condutor de ve\u00edculos automotivos. Dentre outras coisas, o PMK visa avaliar aspectos como Depress\u00e3o e Ela\u00e7\u00e3o, T\u00f4nus Vital, Impulsividade, Explosividade, Ansiedade, Emotividade. O teste PMK era muito usado em concursos onde o candidato precisar\u00e1 usar arma de fogo, ele \u00e9 muito usado pela policia federal. Categorias: Exames Exames e testes do Brasil Quociente de intelig\u00eancia (abreviado para QI, de uso comum) \u00e9 uma medida obtida por meio de testes desenvolvidos para avaliar as capacidades cognitivas (intelig\u00eancia) de um sujeito, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o ao seu grupo et\u00e1rio. A medida do QI \u00e9 normalizada para que o seu valor m\u00e9dio seja de 100 e que tenha um determinado desvio-padr\u00e3o, como 15. \u00cdndice 1 Hist\u00f3ria 2 Sa\u00fade e Q.I. 3 Efici\u00eancia 4 5 Refer\u00eancias 6 Liga\u00e7\u00f5es externas Hist\u00f3ria Os testes de intelig\u00eancia surgiram na China, no s\u00e9culo V[carece de fontes], e come\u00e7aram a ser usados cientificamente na Fran\u00e7a, no s\u00e9culo XX. Em 1905, Alfred Binet e o seu colega Theodore Simon criaram a Escala de Binet-Simon, usada para identificar estudantes que pudessem precisar de ajuda extra na sua aprendizagem escolar. Os autores da escala assumiram que os baixos resultados nos testes indicavam uma necessidade para uma maior interven\u00e7\u00e3o dos professores no ensino destes alunos e n\u00e3o necessariamente que estes tivessem inabilidade de aprendizagem (ver coment\u00e1rios sobre isso em \"Observa\u00e7\u00f5es\"). Esta opini\u00e3o ainda \u00e9 defendida por alguns autores modernos que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o de \u00e1reas psicom\u00e9tricas. No seu artigo New Methods for the Diagnosis of the Intellectual Level of Subnormals Binet relata: Esta escala, propriamente falando, n\u00e3o permite a medida da intelig\u00eancia, porque as qualidades intelectuais n\u00e3o s\u00e3o sobrepon\u00edveis e, portanto, n\u00e3o pode ser medido como superf\u00edcies lineares s\u00e3o medidos, mas s\u00e3o, pelo contr\u00e1rio, uma classifica\u00e7\u00e3o, uma hierarquia entre as diversas intelig\u00eancias, e para as necessidades da pr\u00e1tica dessa classifica\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 equivalente a uma medida.[2] Com pr\u00e1tica,treino e, acima de tudo, m\u00e9todo - escreveu Alfred Binet em 1909, podemos aprimorar nossa aten\u00e7\u00e3o, nossa mem\u00f3ria, nosso julgamento, e literalmente nos tornamos mais inteligentes do que jamais fomos. Em 1912, Wilhelm Stern prop\u00f4s o termo \"QI\" (quociente de intelig\u00eancia) para representar o n\u00edvel mental, e introduziu os termos \"idade mental\" e \"idade cronol\u00f3gica\". Stern prop\u00f4s que o QI fosse determinado pela divis\u00e3o da idade mental pela idade cronol\u00f3gica. Assim uma crian\u00e7a com idade cronol\u00f3gica de 10 anos e n\u00edvel mental de 8 anos teria QI 0,8, porque 8 / 10 = 0,8. Em 1916, Lewis Madison Terman prop\u00f4s multiplicar o QI por 100, a fim de eliminar a parte decimal: QI = 100 x IM / IC, em que IM = idade mental e IC = idade cronol\u00f3gica. Com esta f\u00f3rmula, a crian\u00e7a do exemplo acima teria QI 80. A classifica\u00e7\u00e3o proposta por Lewis Terman era a seguinte: QI acima de 140: Genialidade 121 - 140: Intelig\u00eancia muito acima da m\u00e9dia 110 - 120: Intelig\u00eancia acima da m\u00e9dia 90 - 109: Intelig\u00eancia normal (ou m\u00e9dia) 80 - 89: Embotamento 70 - 79: Lim\u00edtrofe 50 - 69: Racioc\u00ednio Lento Origem: Wikip\u00e9dia.\nCURSO DE RACIOC\u00cdNIO L\u00d3GICO TESTE DE QI QUOCIENTE DE INTELIG\u00caNCIA EXAME PSICOT\u00c9CNICO MATEM\u00c1TICO DETRAN admiss\u00e3o em empresas Lei de forma\u00e7\u00e3o\n http://youtu.be/5X1y-EcfIXk", "title": "CURSO DE  RACIOC\u00cdNIO L\u00d3GICO TESTE DE QI QUOCIENTE DE INTELIG\u00caNCIA  EXAME PSICOT\u00c9CNICO MATEM\u00c1TICA", "publishedDate": "2014-07-08T19:25:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "5X26w83sD80", "description": "This started as a parody of sorts...I was playing the uke and singing a silly bit about old man Jones on a farm in a barn etc. Over time it grew into this song...", "title": "\"Old Man Jones\"(David Slattery/Original)", "publishedDate": "2009-11-21T05:44:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "5X2TNotDDLA", "description": "kompisen drar 270kg i mark l\u00e4tt o v\u00e4ger bara ca 80kg sj\u00e4lv :)", "title": "marklyft - lidk\u00f6ping-peter svedberg filmar", "publishedDate": "2011-02-15T01:28:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "5X2y90Irtbo", "description": "", "title": "En Estepa \"LA ALGARROBILLA\" el Pela en le Teide II", "publishedDate": "2008-12-29T22:54:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "5X3ARPSLUdc", "description": "", "title": "MANUEL CORTES Y ISABEL PANTOJA CONCIERTO TEATRO AXERQUIA CORDOBA", "publishedDate": "2014-09-07T12:18:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "5X3G-pe42dw", "description": "http://www.DadLabs.com - NEW AND EXPECTING PARENTS ORDER SANE PARENTS GUIDE: http://amzn.com/B0088QWG9Q - Daddy Brad and Daddy Clay help get Daddy Danny ready for the impending delivery of his first child.

Perhaps even pack your own snacks, or even a picnic type meal for after the baby is born.\n\nOnce at the hospital, learn the nurses names, and be polite(but not too polite or the Mom will hurt you), because they will be taking care of you for the next couple of days. Don't be afraid to let them know your wishes, but a positive vibe will make things much smoother and happier for all involved.\n\nIn the room remember these important points: Adjustable bed, use those buttons 'til she is comfortable, then don't touch them unless asked. Do not touch the TV remote, it is not for Dads! You CAN use the bathroom, #1 ONLY. Be sure your camera/phone batteries are charged, but don't miss the experience being behind the camera. A playlist of Mom's favorite songs and knowing how to give good footrubs are a good idea.\n\nDon't forget that Push Present! Just a small gift after things have settled down to show your appreciation for her bringing your child into the world. And remember to hold that baby as much as possible! Good luck Danny!

Opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) is a mammal species infraclass is Marsupialia introduced to north america from south america around 100 years ago as a food source by people as it is known to be the biggest and tasty of the Possum families. To survive pedation it has developed a strategy  in witch it acts like a sick rabid animal by foming at the mouth and excreting a foul oder from near its anus. Intrestingly they have one of the lowest rates of rabies infection of all mammals.\nNow living from the northeast of Mexico to Bolivia, including the Lesser Antilles, where it is called manicou. It prefers the woods, but can also live in fields and cities.\nThe Southern Opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) (also called the Common Opossum or in the Antilles the Manicou) is a wide ranging species of opossum that is located throughout southern Mexico all the way to Bolivia. The size of the common opossum is around the size of what we consider the common house cat. The fur of the opossum is actually yellow in the under-fur, but is hidden by the longer black guard-hairs that cover it, while the tail, fingers, and face are lighter \"with the tail being without fur, somewhat similar to a giant rat tail.\" It can measure nearly 20 inches long. It has large ears that are usually black, and its face is usually a pale peach in color, with black whiskers and eyes that reflect reddish in light. With a body length of nearly a foot, and a tail that can reach almost two feet, the Common Opossum is one of the larger relatives in its family. They can weigh in at over three pounds, and they mostly live in the trees however they can live without them.\nTheir habits and behavior are geared toward nocturnal activity, and terrestrial, and some arboreal exploration and habitation. They have a broad ability to adapt to environmental changes, and their teeth allow for them to eat many different foods which it forages for mostly on the ground. It can eat any number of small insects, small animals, fruits, vegetables, and also carrion. Their ability to digest almost anything edible gives them a broader range than a human (we do in fact have a broad range of things we can digest as omnivores ourselves) in what the Common Opossum can eat. They are usually a solitary animal, however will pair up on occasion for mating. They have a wide range of nesting in addition to their general-purpose status \"usually they will create one in the hollow of a tree, however they will also dig a burrow and next in any dark location if nothing else is suitable (which often gets them in trouble with humans). They're also considered pests due to their nature of being the all around marsupial version of the Raccoon. Raided trashcans, habitation of locations that are not suitable, and causing mayhem if encountered within a living space of humans, they are often times trapped and killed.\nTheir scientific classification is Didelphis Marsupialis, which shows that they belong to the genus Didelphis in which all of the large American opossums are a part of. The Didelphis genus belongs to the subfamily Didelphinae which in turn belongs to the family Didelphidae. Didelphidae belongs to the order Didelphinmorphia, of which all of the common opossums belong to (those opossums being in the western hemisphere from North to South America). Their infraclass is Marsupialia, which means they are related to kangaroos, koalas and many other marsupials.\nInteresting Facts about Common Opossums:\n\u25a0The Common Opossum is sometimes used for food in poorer areas by humans.\n\nThe Common Opossum lives for around 2.5 years and will have 5-9 babies between one and three times per year after maturity. The mother raises the young carries them on her back taking them to her feeding spots ie fruit trees and snail/ insect food areas.", "title": "Opossum  baby (Didelphis marsupialis)", "publishedDate": "2011-05-25T17:24:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "5XEcFsRbA08", "description": "Das Coachin-Huhn macht einen Spaziergang im Vorgarten.

The gastrocnemius is the larger muscle that is visible on the back of the leg, and the soleus is the smaller muscle that is lower down on the back of the leg and mostly underneath the gastrocnemius. Both muscles end up attaching to the heel via the achilles tendon and serve to point the toes down (plantarflexion). These muscles are vital in walking, running, and propelling the body. \n\nStrains in the calf come in varying degrees:\n\nGrade 1\n\nSlight pain in the back of the leg\nZero to very slight restricted motion or activity\nTightness, aching, and slight pain for up to 5 days\nGrade 2\n\nPronounced, sharp, and restrictive pain\nSwelling and bruising\nTightness and aching for up to 10 days\nGrade 3\n\nSevere pain that is fully restrictive\nModerate to complete inability to restrict the muscles\nSignificant bruising and swelling\nIn the most severe cases (ruptures) the muscle is bunched up towards the top of the calf\n\n\nCalf strains occur due to injury during acceleration, change of direction, or repeated flexion under duress. The muscles may initially begin to spasm, cramp, or swell. Bruising may also become apparent at some time after the initial injury.\n\nTreatment of a grade I calf strain involves rest most importantly. Ice, elevation, and compression can reduce pain and inflammation, but should not be relied upon to continue strenuous activity. KT Tape provides excellent support for these muscles during unavoidable activity, reducing aching and tightness in the calf. This application also provides inhibition of the muscles to promote relaxation and healing.", "title": "KT Tape: Calf Strain", "publishedDate": "2010-01-26T20:39:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "5XUFS2tvAYs", "description": "A tous ceux qui se rappellent des pistes difficiles sur le bas de la station des 2 Alpes, ce sera bient\u00f4t un lointain souvenir...

The reason they're interested in that is because they want to see how much equity in your company they're going to get in return for a capital infusion, and they're going to go about that in several different ways. \nOne method that they're going to commonly use, though, is what's called the price-to-earnings ratio. And what the price-to-earnings ratio is is it's, quite simply, the price of your stock divided by the earnings per share of your stock over a 12-month period. For example, let's say Company A's stock price is $20, and let's say the most recent annual earnings for Company A was $2 per share. The price-to-earnings ratio of Company A is 10. Now, the way our investors are going to use this information is, they're going to go out, and they're going to do some research on publicly traded companies in your market space, and they're going to look at an average of price-to-earnings ratios across those companies, and they're going to arrive at what this industry can support, and then they're going to make some determinations about how long it's going to take you to achieve sufficient revenue and sufficient earnings to execute an exit plan, and they're going to make some assumptions about what the stock markets at that point and time are going to have an appetite for in terms of public offerings or sales, and they're going to accordingly assign a price-to-earnings ratio to your company. And it's also important for you to understand this, because what you want to do is, you want to do your own homework so that you can go and, when the time comes, negotiate with the investors and really be prepared to defend the value of your company, because, after all, you're going to be giving up a portion of your equity in your company in exchange for the cash infusion. \nAnd if you think you need help, get in touch with us at the Capital Match Point. That's what we're here to do. We're here to put you in the best position to negotiate when the time comes.", "title": "Business Plan-Valuation Method - Price to Earnings Ratio", "publishedDate": "2010-01-24T20:49:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "5XdG0zVVagw", "description": "Ghanian Actor John Dumelo, photo shoot with Toronto Elites, coverage by www.rockingfm937.com", "title": "Ghanian Actor John Dumelo, photo shoot with Toronto Elites, coverage by www.rockingfm937.com", "publishedDate": "2012-11-08T23:55:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "5XdyT9lz5kU", "description": "Sea Doo Jet Skiing  at Harrison Lake and Harrison Hot springs area British Columbia Canada", "title": "Sea Doo Jet Skiing  at Harrison Lake and Harrison Hot springs   British Columbia Canada", "publishedDate": "2011-12-19T03:07:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Xen6zLKVxo", "description": "As always a like is appreciated and if you can please try to stick around for the whole video!\n\nA short little video on what aviation could mean to you (of course there are other things but I tried to cover some main ones).

Wally\nScreenwriter: Ron Osborn, Jeff Reno, Kevin Wade, Bo Goldman, Alberto Casella, Walter Ferris, Maxwell Anderson, Gladys Lehman\nFilm Description: The cycle of life on Earth hangs in the balance when Death becomes emotionally involved in this romantic fantasy. William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is a tremendously wealthy and powerful man who oversees a worldwide multi-media empire. Despite the loss of his wife, whom he dearly loved, William is content with his life, and he's very close to his two daughters, Allison (Marcia Gay Harden) and Susan (Claire Forlaini). One night, as William is fighting a hostile takeover of his company and Allison is planning an elaborate party to celebrate her dad's 65th birthday, William begins displaying the symptoms of a severe heart attack, and he is visited by a mysterious stranger, Joe Black (Brad Pitt). Joe is actually the angel of death, who has taken the form of a man who recently passed on to pay William a call. It seems that William is due to move on to the next world, but (no great surprise) he doesn't want to go. Joe, on the other hand, is curious to know what life is like for mere mortals, so the two men strike a deal -- William will have some time to get his affairs in order, and Joe will wait and see what it's like to be a human being. Joe decides that he likes it very much when he falls in love with Susan, but negotiating the slippery slopes of romance is no easier for Joe than for any ordinary man. Meet Joe Black is an updated version of Alberto Casella's play Death Takes a Holiday, which was adapted for the screen in 1934.\n\n\"meet joe black\",\"meet joe black clip\",\"meet joe black trailer\",\"meet joe black soundtrack\",\"meet joe black part 1 of 14\",\"meet joe black ending part\",\"meet joe black ending\",\"meet joe black crash\",\"brad pitt\",\"richard clarke\",\"peanut videos\",\"spoon videos\",\"romantic dramas\",drama,fantasy,romance,\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"celia d costas\",\"ronald l schwary\",\"martin brest\",\"david j wally\",\"kitchen videos\",\"joe black\",butler,\"young man in coffee shop\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++158858,/m/0c6qh", "title": "Meet Joe Black (5/10) Movie CLIP - Peanut Butter Man (1998) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-31T19:07:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "5XkB1KndjEs", "description": "Alex Chinneck's WONDROUS floating market of Covent Garden\nThe floating market of Covent Garden: Find out how artist created this stunning optical illusion which makes building appear to have broken free from its foundations", "title": "Alex Chinneck's WONDROUS floating market of Covent Garden", "publishedDate": "2014-10-02T20:31:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "5XkFXqllkck", "description": "This is what happens when we get bored at school", "title": "Clucking", "publishedDate": "2013-04-27T18:22:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "5XkN2gPPBFE", "description": "", "title": "Treatment of the Neck - Levator scapulae", "publishedDate": "2013-11-23T02:54:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "5XkwbGda3BE", "description": "Ayam Serama Seri Batik di Malaysia.\nUntuk maklumat lanjut tentang Serama, \nSila Hubungi Eric Lee, Kuala Lumpur (019-2226188)", "title": "Ayam Serama - Seri Batik", "publishedDate": "2013-03-01T07:31:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Xl2n3vmCKI", "description": "A whole week of 'experimental' uploads.\nDay one!\n\nEmployee of the Year\nhttps://soundcloud.com/employeeoftheyearmusic\nhttps://www.facebook.com/EmployeeOfTheYear\nhttp://employeeoftheyearmusic.tumblr.com/\n\nWild Belle\nhttp://soundcloud.com/wildbelle\nhttp://www.facebook.com/wildbelle\nhttp://www.twitter.com/wildbellemusic\n\nPicture by ?\nIf anyone knows who took this picture, please link me to their page.\n\nFacebooobs\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MrSuicideSheep\n\n\n*If any producer or label has an issue with any of the uploads please get in contact (suicide_sheep@hotmail.com) with me and I will delete it immediately (this includes artists of the images used).", "title": "Wild Belle - It's Too Late (Employee of the Year Remix)", "publishedDate": "2013-01-28T19:04:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Xl5nIVGo8w", "description": "A quick clip of the Eradicator.

For example, there are Infielders gloves, Outfielders gloves, Catchers mitts, Pitchers gloves and First Basemens gloves. In this video, Major League Baseball stars, of different positions, share the type of Wilson baseball glove that suits each of them the best. Both Cincinnati Reds Second basemen and Texas Rangers Shortstop Elvis Andrus prefer Wilson's Infielder gloves because they are a shorter 11 and 1/2 to 11 and 3/4 inches, have a short pinkie, a short thumb, dual welding, and a shallow pocket which allows them to get the baseball out faster. Elvis Andrus prefers the Wilson A200 Model 1786 infield baseball glove. It's a SuperSkin model, which means it's half the weight, and twice as strong as leather.  MLB outfielder Josh Hamilton prefers a bigger outfielders glove around 12 to 12 \u00bd.  Hamilton specifically prefers the Wilson A2000 Model: KP92 outfielder's glove. The pitcher's glove made by Wilson is typically 11 3/4-12 1/2 inches, with a nice deep pocket wide, and the webbing is completely closed.  Major League Baseball player C.J. Wilson prefers the Wilson A2000 Model: 1796; he likes the deep pocket and its durability.  Depending on what position you play, Wilson has the right baseball glove for you.\n\nMLB stars share tips on how they find the perfect baseball glove.
