With wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and psychic son Danny (Danny Lloyd) in tow, frustrated writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) takes a job as the winter caretaker at the opulently ominous, mountain-locked Overlook Hotel so that he can write in peace. Before the Overlook is vacated for the Torrances, the manager (Barry Nelson) informs Jack that a previous caretaker went crazy and slaughtered his family; Jack thinks it's no problem, but Danny's \"shining\" hints otherwise. Settling into their routine, Danny cruises through the empty corridors on his Big Wheel and plays in the topiary maze with Wendy, while Jack sets up shop in a cavernous lounge with strict orders not to be disturbed. Danny's alter ego, \"Tony,\" however, starts warning of \"redrum\" as Danny is plagued by more blood-soaked visions of the past, and a blocked Jack starts visiting the hotel bar for a few visions of his own. Frightened by her husband's behavior and Danny's visit to the forbidding Room 237, Wendy soon discovers what Jack has really been doing in his study all day, and what the hotel has done to Jack.\n\n\"the shining\",\"the shining clip\",\"the shining trailer\",\"the shining part 1\",\"jack nicholson\",\"shelley duvall\",\"stanley kubrick\",\"baseball bat videos\",\"paper videos\",\"typewriter videos\",\"classic horror movies\",\"dramas based on bestsellers\",\"dramas based on the book\",horror,\"psychological thrillers\",\"slashers and serial killers\",\"supernatural horror\",\"jan harlan\",\"mary lea johnson\",\"robert fryer\",\"evil videos\",\"fear videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++44363,/m/09fb5,/m/0421st", "title": "The Shining (2/7) Movie CLIP - All Work and No Play (1980) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T04:21:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "4lQlMnnaLB4", "description": "Inca Kola es una marca especial para los peruanos.

However, what most people do not know is that these simple Wills routinely cause many extremely damaging personal and financial problems for beneficiaries. \n\nThese problems range from legal disputes that can cost the estate up to $100,000 per day in court, to the loss of inheritances from various unnecessary taxes, divorce and family court proceedings, creditors and bankruptcy rulings.\n\nMost people also don't realise that there are over 12 different laws and legal regimes that can detrimentally impact on the distribution of your estate to your loved ones. This is the crux of the problem with simple Wills...all they deal with is 'WHO' is to receive an estate, but say nothing or very little about the far more important 'HOW' the nominated beneficiary receives the estate. \n\nHowever, there is a solution. Modern Estate Planning Wills drafted by an expert from RetireLaw. \n\nVoice-over\n\n\"For some families, of greater concern than estate maximisation is the ongoing health and welfare of beneficiaries they consider to be 'vulnerable'. This could be because of their age, an addiction, an illness, a disability, or simple because they are bad with money. \n\nTo deal with unforseen life changes, and to ensure the long term financial security, health and welfare of any beneficiary who may become vulnerable or at risk later in life, all RetireLaw Wills include crisis provisions, along with an appropriate qualifying age. \n\nFor beneficiaries with a permanent disability or illness, with little or no likelihood of ever being capable of managing an inheritance, RetireLaw Wills would also include special protective trust provisions to ensure their long-term health and well-being. \"\n\nSpeak to the experts, speak to RetireLaw\n\nRetireLaw Pty Ltd\nPhone: 02 8908 9700\nEmail: info@retirelaw.com.au\nLevel 2, 77 Pacific Highway\nNorth Sydney NSW 2060", "title": "Wills & Testamentary Trusts presentation: Vulnerable Beneficiaires", "publishedDate": "2012-07-05T07:12:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "4leO4YRjczk", "description": "The 'Coming On Videocassette logo used from 1989-1991, only with a different jingle.", "title": "Coming on Videocassette (Fake 1)", "publishedDate": "2014-02-02T17:38:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "4lez7uiF0wI", "description": "The Third Notion playing Last Orders live at The Counting House, St Helens.", "title": "The Third Notion - Last Orders (Live The Counting House)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-10T13:50:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "4lf26JLbVF4", "description": "Composer/pianist Ola Gjeilo joins the CWU Chamber Choir (Gary Weidenaar, director) in presenting Gjeilo's \"The Ground\" - featuring the the CWU string faculty members who comprise the Kairos String Quartet.\n\nIn mid-April, 2011, Ola spent 3 days on the Central Washington University Campus for a project in which he joined the choir in recording 3 of his compositions.

It has a huge mouth which can be up to 1.4 m wide. Its mouth is at the very front of its head (not on the underside of the head like in most sharks). It has a wide, flat head, a rounded snout, small eyes, 5 very large gill slits, 2 dorsal fins (on its back) and 2 pectoral fins (on its sides). The spiracle (a vestigial first gill slit used for breathing when the shark is resting on the sea floor) is located just behind the shark's eye. Its tail has a top fin much larger than the lower fin.\nThe whale shark has distinctive light-yellow markings (random stripes and dots) on its very thick dark gray skin. Its skin is up to 10 cm thick.

We're gonna hold the brain for you. So where they, they come from over here or over here. And they are repetitive and why don't you talk about what symptoms they have. The temporal lobe is important because, this is the area of the brain that, a lot of languages in here, memory and processing and even emotions come from the temporal lobe. This is a very delicate area because if you have too many seizures it can actually scar the area in the brain. Or you can be born with a scar or even infection can affect the temporal lobe. And often people who have had a history of febrile seizures or prolonged seizures over a period of time will have a part of the temporal lobe become smaller over time and then more prone to generate more seizures. What's interesting about temporal lobes, seizures is that they can start out not looking like the seizures you think of, with jerking or twitching. There could be confusion, mumbling, feeling funny, gastric uprisings, anxiety, deja vu. A deja vu feeling is very common, stomach upsets. And what happens with temporal lobe seizures is, people often mistake them for something else like a psychiatric disorder, panic, anxiety. And they don't get treated for a long time because people don't realise they are actually seizures. And the part of temporal lobe seizures is that they start in this area and then they spread to other areas of the brain. And that's when you can see the jerking and twitching. Right, so it starts late in the process. So this will be called a partial complex seizure. Where they start in one area of the brain, the temporal lobe; you get these funny feelings and sensations, whether its fear, anxiety, deja vu, confusion, memory issues. And then it get spread into other areas of the brain and spreads. So that's a typical example of a partial complex seizure that comes from the temporal lobe.", "title": "What's Temporal Lobe Epilepsy? | Epilepsy", "publishedDate": "2012-07-27T11:17:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "4lp7EMTD-TE", "description": "HELLO again!

According to witnesses the craft hovered silently in the sky before vanishing. Meanwhile in the town of Volkhov another UFO was seen only days ago (first video below): in this case the object, also glowing, was diamond shaped.\nNow scientists and researchers are asking; Why are UFO events occurring at such an increasing rate? Many believe aliens might be trying to warn humanity of some impending disaster. \nWhat do you think?\n \nCheck out more amazing UFO and alien related articles here \n \nTo comment please join our

Sorry for the long wait on this one. I've always loved this song growing up. So awesome, almost as good as the brambles/stickerbrush symphony theme! I had a lot of different ideas as I was progressing through this cover, and unfortunately it kept delaying the process of getting it done earlier. Every time I had a solid idea on how I wanted the song to sound, I would add something new and it would make me rethink what I was doing. It was like an endless loop and drove me nuts! I finally decided to just keep what I had and wrap it up. For this one I didn't try taking a lot of liberties here. I wanted to keep it close to the original. Programmed drums, trying to keep it close to the original along with a little sample. I also want to introduce you guys to the newest member of the musical family, my new electric-acoustic guitar : the Yamaha FGX700SC.

T\u00fcrkiye, Avrupa Konseyi'ne, NATO'ya, OECD'ye, AGIT'e ve G-20'ye \u00fcye olarak Bati D\u00fcnyasiyla b\u00fct\u00fcnlesmistir. 1963 yilindan beri Avrupa Ekonomik Toplulugu'nun imtiyazli ortagi ve 1995 yilindan beri G\u00fcmr\u00fck Birligi'nin \u00fcyesi olan T\u00fcrkiye, 2005 yilinda Avrupa Birligi ile tam \u00fcyelik g\u00f6r\u00fcsmelerine baslamistir. T\u00fcrkiye ayni zamanda T\u00fcrk Konseyi, T\u00fcrk K\u00fclt\u00fcr ve Sanatlari Ortak Y\u00f6netimi, Islam Isbirligi Teskilati ve Ekonomik Isbirligi \u00d6rg\u00fct\u00fc gibi \u00f6rg\u00fctlere \u00fcye olarak Orta Dogu ile, Orta Asya'daki T\u00fcrk devletleri ile ve Afrika \u00fclkeleri ile yakin ekinsel, politik, ekonomik ve end\u00fcstriyel iliskiler gelistirmistir.\n\nAvrupa ve Asya kitalari arasindaki ge\u00e7is yollari \u00fczerindeki konumu T\u00fcrkiye'ye anlamli bir g\u00fc\u00e7 ve \u00f6nem kazandirmaktadir. T\u00fcrkiye, siyaset bilimciler ve ekonomistlere g\u00f6re stratejik konumu, b\u00fcy\u00fck ekonomisi ve askeri kabiliyetiyle bir b\u00f6lgesel g\u00fc\u00e7t\u00fcr\nTarih\u00e7i Ilber Ortayli bir makalesinde Cenevizli ve Venedikli t\u00fcccar ve diplomatlarin, 12. y\u00fczyilda, T\u00fcrkiye'yi Turchia ve Turkmenia olarak tanimladiklarini belirtir.[10] Ayrica, T\u00fcrkiye adi ilk defa 1190'da bir yazili kaynakta, Ha\u00e7li Seferi vak'ayinamesinde ge\u00e7mektedir.[kaynak belirtilmeli] Abdulhaluk \u00c7ay ise Turchia tanimini \u00e7ok daha gerilere g\u00f6t\u00fcr\u00fcr ve Turchia tabirine ilk defa 6. y\u00fczyilda Bizans kaynaklarinda rastlandigini belirtir ve s\u00f6yle der \"Bu tabir 9. ve 10. y\u00fczyillarda Idil/Volga Nehri'nden Orta Avrupa'ya kadar uzanan saha i\u00e7in kullanilmistir.

Tarihte 13-14. y\u00fczyillarda Misir Meml\u00fbkleri de T\u00fcrkiye adini kullanmislardi: \"ed-devlet \u00fct T\u00fcrkiya\" (1250-1387). T\u00fcrk\u00e7edeki kelime anlami ise T\u00fcrk ve Iye (ait) kelimelerinin birlesmesi ile olusan T\u00fcrkiye kelimesidir.\n\nOsmanli Devleti'nde, 19. y\u00fczyila kadar T\u00fcrkiye adi kullanilmadi; Devlet-i \u00c2liyye, Devlet-i Osmaniye, Memalik-i Sahane, Diyar-i Rum adlari kullanildi. Fakat dis d\u00fcnyanin zaman zaman Osmanli Imparatorlugu adini kullanmak yerine T\u00fcrkiye adini kullandigi bilinmektedir.

I'm one of the head decorators here at Amanda Oakleaf Cakes. I really enjoy working here and being a cake decorator and more specifically cupcake decorator. Please come visit us at our store front it's at 1 Pauline Street in Winthrop, Massachusetts and you can also visit our website at oakleadcakes.com. And today I'm going to be talking to you about cupcake decorating. Today I'm going to show you how to decorate a cupcake with a butter cream rose. So the first thing you want to start with filling your bag. I filled mine with some pink frosting. You want to fit it with a large rose tip. As you can see the rose tip is larger at the bottom and it tapers to a smaller top. Let's start the cupcake. It's easier to hold it in your hand. So you want to start with the larger portion of the tip at the bottom and you want to hold the cupcake. Squeeze even pressure. You want to make a dome on top and that's going to be the top of the rose. So once you have your dome, you want to take your rose tip and you want to start covering the seams. And you want to make about three of these and as you can see it's starting to already look like a rose. And as you keep turning the cupcake you want to just keep making your rose petals and slipping them down towards the bottom of the cupcake. And you want to keep doing that until the cupcake is full of rose petals. These are great for anniversaries or Valentines Day or even just somebody who likes flowers. I know I do. So once you get to having a full cupcake, it's full of rose petals and now you want to finish it off. So you want to take the tip and you want to turn it towards yourself and you want to make big sweeping petals and this will close any gaps. If you have any hanging just put it back in your bowl. And this will make it a nice neat finish for the cupcake itself. Just close that gap. And as you can see you have a beautiful rose cupcake top.\"", "title": "How to Pipe a Rose Petal | Cupcake Decorating", "publishedDate": "2011-10-19T22:51:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "4m8S85GsjWg", "description": "I was having some serious pain in my mouth when I developed a massive abscess in the upper right.

He then drained all the pus and put a drain in it.  \n\nI am so very thankful that Dr. Justin Marostica of Tigard TenderCare Dental was able to see me so quick and knew what to do to relieve my pain.

But a lot of people do them wrong by placing excess strain on the elbow joints. In this video I'll show you the right way to do them for maximum results.\n\nI personally like to take my tricep push downs and tricep extensions through a full range of motion and purposely stretch out the triceps in the bottom of the rep.\n\nHowever, a lot of folks will purposely stop their reps short by only bringing their arms to 90 degree angles. What this does is lock up your elbows and places all the stress on the joint. But when you go past 90 degrees (especially with tricep work) you'll stretch out the muscles and transfer the stress from the elbow joint to the actual triceps themselves.\n\nI suggest you try doing both variations in your next arm workout, stopping at 90 degrees, and also going through the full range of motion and stretching out your triceps. And then decide for yourself what one works the best for you.\n\nMake sure to download a copy of the Blast Your Biceps Mass Building Arm Specialization Training System at: http://www.BlastYourBiceps.com\n\nAnd also make sure to subscribe to my YouTube Channel so that you can stay up to date with all my latest training videos and workout tips.\n\nhttp://www.YouTube.com/leemhayward\n\ntricep push down workout\ntriceps exercise\nhow to build big arms \ntricep workout\ntriceps pushdown\ntriceps pressdown\ntriceps exercises\ntricep cable pushdown", "title": "Tricep Push Downs - the \"Right Way\" for Big Arms!", "publishedDate": "2011-07-30T04:53:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4m9OIQEgBOg", "description": "http://doctorwhotv.co.uk", "title": "Death in Heaven Radio Trailer Doctor Who", "publishedDate": "2014-11-02T17:03:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "4m9Qa1CcBzQ", "description": "FERN SPORE MAGNIFIED 100x.

There is little data and published research on men and silicone injections.\n\nPlastic surgeon, Dr. Daniel Slobodianik, said other countries in Latin America have larger numbers of patients receiving silicone injections. The practice is punishable in Venezuela with a two-year prison sentence.\n\n\"Venezuela is not the country which has the highest number of patients with biopolymers. Apparently Argentina, Brazil and Mexico lead Venezuela with more patient injections but in those countries there is no type of legislation over this substance. Venezuela is the only country in the region with laws against biopolymers because both distribution and sale are banned, as well as its administration, it's punishable,\" he said.\n\nStill, patients seeking a silicone-based buttock injection can find illegal businesses to perform the procedure with an average cost of $8, according to local media reports.\n\nSlobodianik said the silicone injections are undeniably dangerous. The injections take a couple minutes but they can never fully be taken out with the patient eventually becoming irreversibly ill.\n\n\"It's not a question of where the product is from and who injects it - because he/she could be a hairdresser or doctor - or where it was injected. This is about a synthetic material, plastic, it's a liquid silicon which cannot be injected into the tissues. It's as easy as that,\" he said.\n\nTwo years ago, de Aguiar started feeling intense pain in her left leg as well as reddening of the skin and a burning sensation in her lower back.\n\nTests confirmed the presence of granuloma, the formation of a mass of immune cells, inflammatory cells and scar tissue that forms when the immune system attempts to wall off substances that it perceives as foreign but is unable to eliminate.\n\nShe has had to undergo surgery to remove the mass formations. She said the experience changed her view on plastic surgery overall, but particularly silicone injections.\n\n\"After the surgery I will now reject any aesthetic (cosmetic) procedures. After this I won't have anything else done,\" she said.\n\nIn the last three decades, Venezuela has won more beauty titles than any other country. Entering beauty competitions has become a national pastime and even an obsession. The sale of beauty products is also very high among Venezuelan women.\n\n\"The aesthetic (cosmetic) part of it blinds us and we don't see there are more important things,\" said Aguiar.\n\nDe Aguiar's doctor was arrested in 2010 accused of injecting silicone into the buttocks of a woman who died from respiratory failure during the procedure.\n\nAccording to Jesus Pereira, the president of the Venezuelan Plastic Surgeons Association, an estimated 25 to 30 percent of Venezuelan women aged 16 to 55 have undergone a liquid silicone buttock injection. Local media reported the death of 17 women in the past year from botched procedures.\n\n\"I would say that between 25 to 30 percent of our female population between the ages of 16 to 55 years of age have been injected this material (biopolymers) but not recently but a long time ago.\"\n\nNGO's have said the government needs to start strong campaigns to warn young women about the dangers of illegal cosmetic surgeries. Although Venezuela's laws impose strict sanctions over illegal practices, state regulation is minimal, according to NGOs.", "title": "Silicone Buttock Injections Spark Fears In Venezuelan Women", "publishedDate": "2013-10-25T03:37:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "4mHj-otuvPA", "description": "Learn more about Norman Mailer: A Double Life at http://books.simonandschuster.com/Norman-Mailer-A-Double-Life/J-Michael-Lennon/9781439150191?mcd=vd_youtube_book  Norman Mailer was one of the most celebrated public figures of his time.

The fetishisation of non-collective behavioural modes (1) extends to cars, jewels and shiny surfaces, in protest against (opposition to) the concretization of the Yugoslav urban landscape & requisitioning of private property. The collapse of the Tito ideal in the aftermath of the 1990s brings about a mirror shift in the dialectic, and the mythologization of a collective Balkan aesthetic becomes possible. In the ZYKOPOPS manifesto this incorporates former shared territories of Hungary and linguistic neighbours Bulgaria.In this neo-collectivization of consciousness, the polyvalent bonding agents of traditional music and rakija point to the possibility of true ecstatic egalitarianism (2).\n\nBy-product of a chance encounter/collision between Croatian alternative traditional band KRIES and apocryphal Scottish producer Martin Swan (MouthMusic \"The Order of Things\"), ZYKOPOPS recruits Balkan nightingale Lidija Dokuzovic in late 2010 to begin work on a seminal canon.

It was persistent. He kept at him until he finally decided to get up..I get scared at night. That\u2019s why I got a cat\u2014for protection. Cats are deadlier than Teddy bears..He's outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.) And his footprints are not found in any file of Scotland Yard's. And when the larder's looted, or the jewel-case is rifled, Or when the milk is missing, or another Peke's been stifled, Or the greenhouse glass is broken, and the trellis past repair - Ay, there's the wonder of the thing! Macavity's not there! And when the Foreign Office find a Treaty's gone astray, Or the Admiralty lose some plans and drawings by the way, There may be a scrap of paper in the hall or on the stair - But it's useless to investigate - Mcavity's not there! And when the loss has been disclosed, the Secret Service say: 'It must have been Macavity!' - but he's a mile away. You'll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumbs, Or engaged in doing complicated long-division sums. Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a Cat of such deceitfulness and suavity. He always has an alibi, and one or two to spaer: At whatever time the deed took place - MACAVITY WASN'T THERE! And they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are widely known (I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone) Are nothing more than agents for the Cat who all the time Just controls their operations: the Napoleon of Crime!\n\n\nMore Videos at our site: http://thecatschannel.com\n\n\nAt Rest Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n\nTags:pets cataday cutie animals beauty happy_cat cutepic pet ccatsofinstagram catpics badday birman animaloftheday fatcat grumpycat catsofgam cc_featuring cats_top100 catofinstagram animallovers catlove cutecatsofinstagram catlovers catsofworld", "title": "392 Unexpected Uses for Kitties", "publishedDate": "2014-07-28T22:47:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "4mnAgkEskFQ", "description": "A baby white faced saki baby is born in Dublin Zoo, don't miss it this Thursday 7pm on RT\u00c9 One", "title": "A white faced saki baby is born in the south american house at Dublin Zoo", "publishedDate": "2014-04-08T12:24:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "4mo6VhW4Z5w", "description": "\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0637\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0644\u062b\nhttps://www.facebook.com/mat.mac.79", "title": "\u0623\u062d\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0663\u0660\u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 2012 Mukalla Independence", "publishedDate": "2012-12-01T16:28:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "4moMHgOo9tE", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Gravel-Spreaders/203373463036365", "title": "The Gravel Spreaders - Loser", "publishedDate": "2013-12-19T03:40:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "4mpOJ-sRY_s", "description": "", "title": "BNS AMEX Plum Music Direct", "publishedDate": "2010-01-08T05:53:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "4mp_a-6QwCs", "description": "Nazwa / Karmazynowy ch\u0142opek, czyli Prza\u015bny Konik Poezji Nieestetycznej\nKompozycja audiowizualna / Marawel\n\u0179r\u00f3d\u0142o audio / Marawel (album \"Commandry\")\n---\n\u00a9 Butterfly (Guild Group) | www.craftport.co\nMade in Poland by using The Eye of The Polish Butterfly", "title": "Karmazynowy ch\u0142opek [Okiem Motyla] -PKPNhub- #4", "publishedDate": "2014-09-11T21:46:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "4mpsYcnsll0", "description": "New Polly Pocket 2013 -\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/NewPollyPocket2013/videos\n  Polly Pocket German series was first designed by Chris Wiggs in 1983 for his daughter Kate. Using a powder compact, he fashioned a small house for the tiny doll. Bluebird Toys of Swindon, England licensed the concept and the first Polly Pocket toys appeared in stores in 1989. Mattel held a distribution arrangement with Bluebird Toys for Polly Pocket items in the early-1990s. In 1998, while production lulled, Bluebird Toys endured several hostile take-over attempts until Mattel finally purchased them later that year.\n\nIn 1998, Mattel redesigned German series animotions and dolls Polly Pocket and created a new series of collectible items. The new doll is larger and has a more lifelike appearance than the original dolls. That same year, Mattel also introduced Fashion Polly!, which used the same characters from the new Polly Pocket (Polly, Lea, Shani, Lila, etc.), but they came in the form of 33\u20444 inches (9.5 cm) plastic jointed dolls. They gave a new spin on fashion dolls; instead of traditional cloth clothing, Polly Pockets used unique \"Polly Stretch\" garments, created by Genie Toys, rubbery plastic clothes that could be put on the dolls and removed. Polly also has clip on clothes that are made of thin, hard plastic. They clip together using magnets embedded in the plastic. There are also some boy dolls (Rick, Steven, etc.) Like Barbie and Bratz dolls, they also star in Polly Pocket videos, books, and sites.\n\nIn November 2006 4.4 million Polly Pocket play sets were recalled by Mattel after children in the United States swallowed loose magnetic parts. Affected toys had been sold around the world for three years prior.[1]\n\nFor the 2010 product line, Mattel made further changes to the Polly dolls, including increasing feet size, head size and leg size, although the height remains approximately the same.\n\n Below are the list of characters who appeared in the Polly Pocket series\nPolly Pocket - the title character with light tone skin, blonde hair and light blue eyes. She is described to be very confident, cool, friendly, optimistic, adventurous, resourceful, and loyal. She loves having fun, adventures, and, importantly, friends. She has many hobbies, such as roller-skating, water-skiing, snowboarding, shopping, playing music, and singing.\nShani - dark tone skin, dark brown hair and brown eyes. She is described to be intelligent and creative. Shani is a technical genius who loves taking things apart to see how they work, as well as a proficient inventor. She loves gadgets, such as MP3 players and headphones.\nLea - tan tone skin with freckles, orange hair and light green eyes. She is described to be athletic and giggly. Lea is an athlete who enjoys many sports, like skiing and soccer. She is also curious about something new to her and is an animal lover.\nLila - pale tone skin, brown hair and light purple eyes. She is described to be sweet and fashionable. Lila is a fashionista who loves to go shopping for the latest styles, trends and accessories. She is also best friends with Crissy, as well as a talented dancer.\nCrissy - olive tone skin, black hair with a magenta streak, and brown eyes. She is described to be stylish and outspoken. Crissy is an aspiring fashion designer who is always full of many artistic and fashionable ideas. She hates it when her looks are messed up.\nKerstie - light tone skin, dark brown hair and blue eyes. She is described to be humorous and enthusiastic. Kerstie is a talented cook who is proficient and somewhat familiar with old and new recipes. She also likes telling her friends about her adventures.\nRick - light tone skin, blonde hair and light blue eyes, like Polly, and has a crush on her.\nTodd - light tone skin, dark brown hair and dark brown eyes.", "title": "New Polly Pocket 2013 - Double Diva", "publishedDate": "2013-05-25T11:46:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "4mpw7axdc7o", "description": "STT inertial sensors can easily track any part of the body.

Ma tra i frutteti e le vigne della zona di Wagram, vicino a Vienna, questo strano uccello dalla corona di piume prospera. Il documentario mostra come l'upupa sia tornata a popolare il centro dell'Europa e come riesca a sopravvivere ogni giorno agli attacchi dei suoi predatori: faine, volpi e ramarri. \n\nIl nome deriva dal verso emesso dal maschio per difendere il territorio, dal suono simile ad un \"hup-hup-hup\". Se rimane inascoltato ne conseguono una caccia ed una lotta estremamente violente, che possono causare l'accecamento di uno dei due combattenti.\n\nC'\u00e8 per\u00f2 un uomo, Manfred Eckenfellner, che ha imparato ad imitare questo verso alla perfezione, diventando \"l'uomo che sussurra alle upupe\". Grazie al suo slancio questo uccello \u00e8 tornato a popolare una regione speciale. Dietro le quinte di tale apparente miracolo si cela un'incredibile storia di scienza e passione. \n\nNell'Antico Egitto l'upupa era considerata sacra; in Persia era simbolo di virt\u00f9; cibo proibito nella Bibbia. In Europa la si riteneva una ladra, in Scandinavia era portatrice di guerra e in Estonia presagio di morte. In una zona come quella di Wagram \u00e8 semplicemente una delle innumerevoli specie che hanno trovato nuove nicchie: il gheppio costruisce il proprio nido sui campanili e il gruccione vive negli stessi strati di l\u00f6ss impiegati dai vignaioli per coltivare le viti.", "title": "Die R\u00fcckkehr des Wiedehopfs (Il ritorno dell'upupa)", "publishedDate": "2013-09-03T13:29:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "4mu9vFHqrVU", "description": "SpaceChem - Applied Fusion - Sikutar: 2052 Elapsed Cycles, 3 Reactors, 108 Symbols Used", "title": "SpaceChem - Applied Fusion", "publishedDate": "2011-03-11T22:18:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "4muNxkIu1iE", "description": "This phonics Lesson is useful for both the teachers and also for many parents who want to help their children become good readers but they aren't sure HOW to teach reading with PHONICS.Phonics lesson to review long vowel /a/ , short vowel /a/ and short vowel /u/ along with some sight words has been created with explicit and detailed instructions.

We arrived at Aldermaston mill to fish a stretch of the Kennet for Barbel not knowing the venue had a carp lake. I spotted the lake which was absolutely gin clear. Everthing swimming in it was a monster. Several thirties were cruising around in the hot sun. I spent a frustrating day trying to tempt the carp with floaters. The temperature was in the 80's, in very bright conditions with gin clear water they were having none of it. Every now and again a fish would nose the bait and swim off again. Towards the end of the session i opted for desperate measures. Firstly i dug around some tree roots with my bankstick and found a lobworm. I then fitted on my match reel with 3.5 llb mainline straight through and tied a size 16 hook on with a swanshot about 5 inches above it. Suicide tackle i hear you say!!! I gently cast this to the side of some lily pads. BANG within sixty seconds i had a take!! What followed was an epic battle lasting 45 minutes as i was obviously playing a big fish on extremely light tackle. Eventually the fish was landed, my arms felt like i had spent allday in the gym.

We are both bright but Adam is significantly more advanced at his age than we were.\n \n\"I think the main reason for his rapid development is that we have found effective ways to make learning enjoyable. Adam is able to progress at his own pace whenever he chooses to and in areas of his choosing.\n \n\"He knows the planets of the solar system, dozens of pairs of words with opposite meanings - he has a great sense of humour and most importantly he is self-motivated, athletic, very happy and playful.\"\n \nAdam, who is already reading the Oxford Reading Tree series designed for seven-year-olds, is already in the top 1.3 per cent of the population.\n \nHis parents expect him to score even higher once his communication skills develop fully.\n \nJohn Stevenage, British Mensa's CEO, said: \"The members of Mensa always welcome new additions as we aim to stimulate people in an intellectual and social environment.\n \n\"We are look to help gifted children and encourage them to develop at an extraordinary.\n \n\"We look forward to Adam joining Mensa and expect him to have a very bright future.\"\n \nAdam's younger brother Ethan is not even two months old, but his proud parents have even bigger hopes for him as he tries to keep up with his big brother's development.\n \nDean said: \"I expect that he will develop at a faster pace than Adam as my wife and I are now more experienced and he has his older brother Adam to learn from.\n \n\"In addition, I've read that second children tend to be in a hurry to catch up with their older siblings so I think this will keep him on an upwards curve.\"\n \nAdam's abilities at 29 months:\n \n- A reading age of at least a 5 year old and reads books such as the Oxford Reading Tree series independently that are aimed at 7 year olds\n \n- Is able to spell over 100 words and also knows many phonics\n \n- Knows some of his times tables (2,3,4,5,10)\n \n- Recognises 2D shapes ranging between one-sided such as circle to 12-sided dodecagon\n \n- Knows numerous 3D shapes\n \n- Can count to more than 1000 in English, up to 20 in Spanish & Japanese and up to 10 in French\n \n- Can add and subtract simple numbers\n \n- Knows the difference between primary, secondary and neutral colours and can name them\n \n- Recognises words when spelt them to him e.g. if his parents spell 'ninety seven' he responds 97\n \n- Can write some letters and numbers by hand\n \n- Can type words and numbers on a keyboard\n \n- Recite his favourite nursery rhymes\n \n- Can read simple fractions\n \n- Knows months of the year and days of the week\n \n- Knows the planets of the solar system\n \n- Knows dozens of pairs of words with opposite meanings\n \n- Knows some elements in the periodic table", "title": "Adam Kirby - Worlds SMARTEST 2 Year Old", "publishedDate": "2013-07-22T15:18:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "4nFGa0VT24k", "description": "Harvester TMO - Processamento de Pinus.\nFonte: TMO Olsen.\nWebsite: http://www.tmo.com.br\nYouTube Channel: www.youtube.com/olsenTMO\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00ad-----------------\nVideo available at: http://www.woodharvesting.com\nSite: http://www.colheitademadeira.com.br\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00ad-----------------\nVisit the Largest Dynamic Forest Fair in Latin America - Expoforest website: http://www.expoforest.com.br\nVisite a Expoforest, a maior feira florestal din\u00e2mica da Am\u00e9rica Latina: http://www.expoforest.com.br", "title": "Harvester TMO - Processamento de Pinus", "publishedDate": "2013-11-22T19:00:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "4nFUjR1tSYc", "description": "Carlos Tevez Great Solo Goal - Juventus vs Parma 4-0 (SerieA) 09/11/2014\nCarlos Tevez Great Solo Goal - Juventus vs Parma 4-0 (SerieA) 09/11/2014\nCarlos Tevez Great Solo Goal - Juventus vs Parma 4-0 (SerieA) 09/11/2014", "title": "Carlos Tevez Great Solo Goal - Juventus vs Parma 4-0 (SerieA) 09/11/2014", "publishedDate": "2014-11-09T15:08:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "4nFZ0Q-rYJE", "description": "Anathematize", "title": "Anathematize Live Univ.Sahid Jakarta", "publishedDate": "2013-06-17T20:48:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "4nFzlyMC4K8", "description": "we were about to leave when these random DiSGUTTERiNG girls started up some bs like they was 'bout to fight. it was ALL mouth! haha. hella WEAK. and then leave it to my family to stand there instigate and laugh at the madness. then the poly dude who was tryna get my attention at the end so he can be in the video. bwahahaha! too dang funny! sorry folks, had to cut it after that.

I love it. \u2665\n\nAnd before anyone facepalms and takes this entirely seriously -- please remember that it's a parody, ahaha!

Typically, you won't see this file format used, however it is quite popular in the publishing industry. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to open TIFF files.\n\nStep # 1 -- Why is TIFF Important\n\nIf you're simply editing images for the internet, whether it is social networking or website graphics, you shouldn't worry about TIFF. However, TIFF files are much bigger in size, but also have much better quality. The quality is shown off in printed photos, but not so much on a standard computer monitor.\n\nStep # 2 -- Opening TIFF Files\n\nTIFF files can be opened with pretty much any image editing software, including Microsoft Paint! Simply navigate to the desired TIFF file and double-click it, or you can right-click the file, go to the \"open with\" option, and select the desired image editing software you'd like to use form that list.\n\nYou now know exactly what a TIFF file is, and how to open TIFF files.", "title": "What is TIFF and How to Open TIFF Files", "publishedDate": "2013-08-01T22:00:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "4nT6ea4HIBM", "description": "Use 1/2 cup rubbing alcohol and 1/2 cup crushed chlorine tablets.

Now, as we begin this time of prayer close to the tabernacle, ask him, like the blind man in the Gospel did, Domine, ut videam! Lord, that I may see! Enlighten my intelligence and let Christ's words penetrate deep into my mind. Strengthen his Life in my soul so that I may be transformed in readiness for eternal Glory.\n\n\n128  \nHow crystal clear Christ's teaching is. As usual, let us turn to the New Testament, this time to St Matthew, chapter eleven: 'Learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart.' Don't you see? We have to learn from him, from Jesus who is our only model. If you want to go forward without stumbling or wandering off the path, then all you have to do is walk the road he walked, placing your feet in his footprints and entering into his humble and patient Heart, there to drink from the wellsprings of his commandments and of his love. In a word, you must identify yourself with Jesus Christ and try to become really and truly another Christ among your fellow men.\n\nTo make sure there is no mistake here, let us read another quotation from St Matthew. In chapter sixteen, Our Lord makes his doctrine even clearer: 'If anyone wishes to come my way, let him deny himself, take up his cross and follow me.' God's way is one of renunciation, of mortification and of self-surrender, but it is not one of sadness or faint-heartedness.\n\nReflect on the example that Christ gave us, from the crib in Bethlehem to his throne on Calvary. Think of his self-denial and of all he went through: hunger, thirst, weariness, heat, tiredness, ill-treatment, misunderstandings, tears... But at the same time think of his joy in being able to save the whole of mankind. And now I would like you to engrave deeply in your mind and upon your heart \u2014 so that you can meditate on it often and draw your own practical conclusions \u2014 the summary St Paul made to the Ephesians when he invited them to follow resolutely in Our Lord's footsteps: 'Be imitators of God, as very dear children, and walk in love, as Christ has loved us and delivered himself up for us, a sacrifice breathing out fragrance as he offered it to God.'\n\n\n129  \nJesus gave himself up for us in a holocaust of love. What about you, who are a disciple of Christ? You, a favoured son of God; you, who have been ransomed at the price of the Cross; you too should be ready to deny yourself. So, no matter what situation we may find ourselves in, neither you nor I can ever allow ourselves to behave in a way that is selfish, materialistic, comfort-loving, dissipated or \u2014 forgive me if I speak too candidly \u2014 just plain stupid! 'If all you want is the esteem of your fellow men, and you long to be respected and appreciated, and you only seek a pleasant life, then you have strayed from the path... Only those who travel the rugged, narrow and austere path of tribulation are allowed to enter the city of the saints, there to rest and reign with the King for eternity.'\n\nYou yourself must decide of your own free will to take up the cross; otherwise, your tongue may say that you are imitating Christ, but your actions will belie your words. That way, you will never get to know the Master intimately, or love him truly. It is really important that we Christians convince ourselves of this. We are not walking with Our Lord unless we are spontaneously depriving ourselves of many things that our whims, vanity, pleasure or self-interest clamour for. Not a single day should pass that has not been seasoned with the salt and grace of mortification; and, please get rid of the idea that you would then be miserable. What a sad little happiness you will have if you don't learn to overcome yourself, if you let your passions and fancies dominate and crush you, instead of courageously taking up your cross!\nhttp://www.escrivaworks.org/book/4/_c8\nMy Lord and my God, under the loving eyes of our Mother, we are making ready to accompany you along this path of sorrow, which was the price for our redemption. We wish to suffer all that You suffered, to offer you our poor, contrite hearts, because you are innocent, and yet you are going to die for us, who are the only really guilty ones. My Mother, Virgin of sorrows, help me to relive those bitter hours which your Son wished to spend on earth, so that we, who were made from a handful of clay, may finally live in libertatem gloriae filiorum Dei, in the freedom and glory of the children of God.\nhttp://www.escrivaworks.org/book/8/0\nhttp://www.josemariaescriva.info/article/the-meaning-of-suffering", "title": "St Josemaria and the meaning of suffering", "publishedDate": "2011-02-14T04:47:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4nTVaqtQsIE", "description": "Dr. Carlo Oller, emergency physician, talks about Gastroenteritis Bacterial", "title": "Gastroenteritis Bacterial", "publishedDate": "2011-10-22T07:51:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "4nT_t3WG6jA", "description": "", "title": "Le d\u00e9collet\u00e9 d'une journaliste polonaise fait le Buzz", "publishedDate": "2012-08-25T06:10:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "4nTgzMqBmDw", "description": "Download Free Now!\nwww.milajonline.com\n\nhttp://www.milajonline.com \"Movin On\", the new single from Mila J A.K.A.

She got her break in 1960, left university and started touring in the States.\n\nI did my first tour with Brownie McGee and Sonny Terry who had been my idols and then I was playing with them, she recalled in 1993. And then I went off to Los Angeles. There was a festival up in Idlewild, the University of California had this arts festival every summer and I taught Canadian folk songs. I never got back to University. I just kept going and eventually I hit New York.\n\nGrief over theft\nWhat followed were those six albums, years of touring and lots of grief over her song Morning Dew being stolen by Tim Rose. In November 1969 she made her London debut at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, and settled in the city the following year.\n\n\nLost Ladies of Folk\nShe recorded just this one album for Argo, then one for Polydor in 1976 (Morning Dew), followed by a few singles in the early eighties. Since then its been pretty much reissues, retrospectives and compilations.\n\nShe had in fact called it quits I didnt feel I was growing, I didnt feel I was doing anything. I just seemed to be doing the same things over and over again and I thought some people are happy to do that, I wasnt. So I thought Ill go back and get my degree. Once back in the university world, she stayed, working as an administrator in the Philosophy Department of Birkbeck College, London.\n\nIn 2007, 28 years after she made her UK debut there, she was persuaded back on to the stage at Queen Elizabeth Hall by Jarvis Cocker, who was running a Lost Ladies of Folk night as part of his Meltdown curatorship.

Mistilteinn first belonged to \u00der\u00e1inn, who had been king in Valland before he retired in his burial mound with his wealth. The Danish king \u00d3l\u00e1fr and his men, among whom Hr\u00f3mundr Gripsson, learnt about that and found the barrow. \u00der\u00e1inn, who had become a draugr (living dead) was sitting inside. No one but Hr\u00f3mundr dared to enter. After a long and fierce fight, he defeated \u00der\u00e1inn and took his treasure, especially his sword, with which \u00der\u00e1inn had killed four hundred and twenty men, including the Swedish king Semingr. Hr\u00f3mundr used Mistilteinn during the battle between \u00d3l\u00e1fr and two Swedish kings both named Haldingr. He killed Helgi inn fr\u00e6kni (the Valiant), who had slain his brothers. He then lost Mistilteinn in the water out of witchcraft. He deeply felt this loss but soon recovered his sword, which was found in the stomach of a pike. But Mistilteinn was of no help when he fought king Haldingr, whom he eventually killed with a club. In Gesta Danorum, Mistletoe is the weapon used to kill Baldr. See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistilteinn\n\nThe name mistletoe was originally applied to Viscum album (European mistletoe, of the family Santalaceae in the order Santalales), the only species native in Great Britain and much of Europe. European mistletoe is readily recognized by its smooth-edged oval evergreen leaves borne in pairs along the woody stem, and waxy white berries in dense clusters of two to six. It is a poisonous plant that causes acute gastrointestinal problems including stomach pain and diarrhea along with low pulse. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistletoe \n\nViscum album mistletoe - Fr\u00e1b\u00e6rt video um Mistiltein - og hvernig hann r\u00f3tar sig \u00e1 trj\u00e1grein : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WOzCllzsCA\n\nMidhurst is the home of English  polo and matches are played from  May to September.

Performance of the Dyson DC23 on carpeting and rugs.  The DC23 performed well on carpeting.   We crushed Oreo cookies and it sucked up these large particles very nicely.  To simulate fine dust, we poured flour on the carpeting.  It took a few passes, but the flour was cleaned up nicely all the way to the edge of the carpet.  We also tested the Turbinehead brush on pet hair, and after a few passes all the pet hair was vacuumed up.  Performance of the Turbinehead Canister Vacuum on Hard Flooring.  On hard floors we did the small particle and large particle test.  The flour stuck to the floor, so we activated the Turbinehead brush bar to dislodge all the particles.  You have to pull out the red tab to do this by the head of the vacuum.  We turned the brush bar off for the large particles, and they were cleaned up very easily.  The Dyson DC23 Vacuum on stairs.  The DC23 has a unique body design allowing the canister to rest on stairs.  That way it can clean a staircase effectively.   We used the Turbinehead brush bar and also used the smaller stair brush.  Both tools worked very nicely.  The Suction Power, Filtration Quality, and Noise Level of this Dyson Vacuum.  The suction on this Dyson was powerful.  It was over 25 Kilopascals, which is more than a typical vacuum.  The exhaust on this vacuum is completely dust-free because of the HEPA filtration system and Dyson root cyclone.  We also tested the noise level, and it was between 75 and 80 decibels, which is average for a vacuum.  Overall, we felt this was a nice canister vacuum.  It works great for carpets and carpeted stairs.  On hard floors it also worked nicely, but it is annoying messing with the red circular tab to transition from different floor types.", "title": "Dyson DC23 Turbinehead Canister Vacuum Review", "publishedDate": "2011-02-14T04:53:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "4oCEs-zuJfE", "description": "", "title": "James Roday-Sexual Perversity In Chicago (2002)", "publishedDate": "2011-05-11T17:19:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "4oCNOmhkY14", "description": "", "title": "te amo estriper de jesyL", "publishedDate": "2009-07-30T07:40:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "4oDIsPftHQk", "description": "FREE DOWNLOAD: http://goo.gl/swzGVP\n\nThis is a collection of 32 presets fo Lennar Digital Sylenth1 I made that are suitable to Progressive House tracks. \n\nI was inspired by labels such as Spinnin, Toolroom, Flamingo, Protocol, Doorn, Axtone and top artists such as Nicky Romero, Knife Party, Dimitri Vegas, Hardwell, Tiesto, Sander Van Doorn, W&W, Steve Angello, Showtek, Aviciii, Alesso, Martin Garrix, Sebastian Ingrosso, Axwell and more.\n\nThe melodies from the video are from my two melody packs.

A few branches of Hydrilla are kept in a beaker containing pond water in which a small amount of sodium bicarbonate is dissolved. The branches are covered with a glass funnel and a test tube full of water is kept inverted over the stem of the funnel as shown in the figure. Now the apparatus is kept in sunlight for 4 to 6 hours. The gas bubbles may be observed from the ends of hydrilla branches kept within the glass funnel. These gas bubbles are collected in the test tube by the downward displacement of water. The gas is tested for oxygen. When a burnt splinter is taken near the mouth of the tube, it glows brightly and proves that the gas is oxygen.The test tube and funnel\nexperiment demonstrates that oxygen evolves during photosynthesis.\n\nPrayaag Eduserv focuses to bring out educational digital contents in audio visual e-learning format, which is easy to understand and help the student remember as and when required. It relieves the student from cramming, memorizing the school text books.We thereby meet the unmet need of learning the school curriculum in multimedia format which makes the student motivated to learn deeper with ease, instead of learn by route. \n\nOur ultimate vision is to trigger creative imagination of the students to learn the content with enthusiasm. With the above mission in mind, we ventured to create Audio Visual Content for Tamilnadu State Board +2 Science & Mathematics. Each subject is given with animations, graphics, images, videos to help the students understand in a simple way. Number of academic experts who are leaders in the respective subjects worked hours &hours with visual communication technology experts to bring about an excellent collaborativeproject of educational ecosystem to achieve the best exam results. The DVDs are easy to use and hence the students enjoy learning.\n\nWe have included Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ), Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) plus solved Board Exam papers.\n\nTo start with, we brought out Physics, Chemistry, Biology &Maths for +2 Tamilnadu State Board Syllabus in English. Soon we will have Physics, Chemistry Biology &Maths for +2 TN State Board Tamil medium students, as well.\n\nThis long journey only just started. Our management is not only focused on the exam results but also on mind development of the students. As we progress we will bring out educational DVD's for +1 and 10th standard students for Tamilnadu State Board.The passion to benefit all the stakeholders including parents, students and teachers, driven us to center our attention on the art and the science of delivering client-delight.\n\nThe unique feature of our DVD content is our natural,easy to understand voiceover which reflects closely the contents as mentioned in the respective text books and also explains the visual images very clearly.\nIt is our endeavor and hope that all our efforts will help the students achieve their Educational Goal and also build job oriented career by preparing the students for engineering and other professional courses.\n\nPlease contact us immediately to get your FREE sample of DVDs.\noperations@prayaageduserv.org \nOr \nsales@prayaageduserv.org", "title": "Test tube and Funnel Experiment.....Prayaageduserv.....", "publishedDate": "2012-07-10T09:08:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "4oOGXBbDPFE", "description": "", "title": "Film Music: Echinoderm Regeneration (Jingle Punks)", "publishedDate": "2014-05-18T09:22:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "4oOMZu_qGeA", "description": "C.

They are also known as sphinx moths. They have stout bodies, relatively small, narrow wings and long tongues or proboscis. They fly chiefly at dusk.\n\n Because the hawk moths have relatively heavy bodies (packed with powerful muscles) and small, narrow triangular wings, they are not able to glide and can fly only with fast powerful beats. The wings moving so quickly that they can be seen only as a blur. The hawk moths can hover, with furiously beating wings, in front of a flower, extend their long tongue and suck up nectar without alighting.  Some of them can even fly backward.\n\n The caterpillars of hawk moths or sphinx are usually impressive and large, which in most species have a sharp horn at the rear end. Like most moths, their pupae are brown and smooth.A great many moth caterpillars merely dig down into the ground and there pupate with no cocoon.\n\nFor the \u201cPandakaki\u201d hawk moth,which I have called as such because the caterpillars lived on the leaves of the medicinal \u201cPandakaki\u201d plant, it took fourteen days in the pupal stage before the imago or the adult moth emerged.\n\nSources:  Grolier\u2019s \u201cThe Book of Knowledge\u201d 1962, Volume 18, pp. \n                    6523-6540.\n        Encyclopedia International 1969 Volume 12, p.302 and \n                    Volume 8, p. 349.\n\nThese moths, Daphnis Nerii, are known as the Oleander Hawk Moth or Army Green Moth found in Mangaon, Maharashtra, India However, there the caterpillars feed mainly on oleander (Nerium oleander) leaves, a highly toxic plant to which toxicity they are immune. They also may feed on most plants of the Dogbane family, such as Adenium obesum, and Tabernaemontana divaricata and Alstonia scholaris in India.\n\n         The newborn caterpillars are pale blue. Their color changes to green as they grow. They have two spots resembling eyes on the forefront of their body.\n\n       The pupa is pale reddish or brownish-white and has a wax-like appearance. It lies directly on the earth, under moss or dry leaves.\n\n       Daphnis nerii is a large hawk-moth found in wide areas of Africa and Asia. It is a migratory species, flying to parts of eastern and southern Europe during the summer, particularly Turkey.\n\nSource: Wikipedia, \"Hawk Moth\" and \"Daphnis Nerii\".", "title": "Lovely Pets Uncut 26 Sorry, I disturbed the first Hawk Moth Caterpillar", "publishedDate": "2010-01-06T03:55:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "4oVtv_aEgH4", "description": "SOUNDISSTYLE - You are what you listen to.\n\u00bb Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/soundisstyle\n\u00bb Twitter: https://twitter.com/soundisstyle\n\u00bb SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/soundisstyle\n\u00bb Tumblr: http://soundisstyle.tumblr.com\n\nA new bit of French magic from LeMarquis.\n\n\u270c Download \"Warm Me Up\"\nhttps://www.facebook.com/lemarquismusic/app_220150904689418\n\n\u270c Follow LeMarquis\nhttps://www.facebook.com/lemarquismusic\nhttps://twitter.com/lemarquismusic\nhttps://soundcloud.com/le_marquis\n\n\u270c Photo via Benjamin Askinas\nhttp://instagram.com/benjaminaskinas\nhttp://benjaminaskinas.tumblr.com/\n\n---------\n\nLyrics:\n\nTell me something you've never said before\nSomething you just hide away and never show\nAnd don't you feel like it's getting warm\nThere's something between us that I just can't explain\n\nI think I'm gonna try now let me tell you\nThere's nothing wrong with you but I never treat you right\nI know it's kind of rough but I'm telling the truth\nAnd if you cross the line I just have to let you know, know\n\nHave to let you know, know\nHave to let you know, know\nHave to let you know, know\n\n'Cause you just \nWarm me up and let me touch you it's easy\nWarm me up and let me tell you my secret\nWarm me up and let me touch you it's easy\nWarm me up and let me tell you my secret\n\nWarm me up\nWarm me up, let you know\nWarm me up\nWarm me up, let you know\nWarm me up\nWarm me up, let you know\nWarm me up\nWarm me up, let you know\n\nGot this crazy feeling coming through my skin\nA heartbeat and a silence going on and on\nAnd you just told me your favorite thing\nYou never saw it coming but that's how it goes\n\nI've got my eyes on you I'm just flying so high\nThis feeling going through my bones just make me sick\nAnd you're the only one who gives me goosebumps\nA fire in the dark and it's keeping me insane, insane\n\nKeeping me insane, insane\nKeeping me insane, insane\nKeeping me insane, insane\n\n'Cause you just \nWarm me up and let me touch you it's easy\nWarm me up and let me tell you my secret\nWarm me up and let me touch you it's easy\nWarm me up and let me tell you my secret\n\nWarm me up\nWarm me up, let you know\nWarm me up\nWarm me up, let you know\nWarm me up\nWarm me up, let you know\nWarm me up\nWarm me up, let you know", "title": "LeMarquis - Warm Me Up", "publishedDate": "2014-07-28T02:00:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "4oW21sDiOZE", "description": "Shia Killing Sunni 1 Thats The Shia Way Take Care Muslims From Shia", "title": "Shia Killing Sunni 1 Thats The Shia Way Take Care Muslims From Shia", "publishedDate": "2009-03-06T08:47:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "4oW8--LHK3A", "description": "To watch more videos visit: http://entertainment.abs-cbn.com/tv/shows/thevoiceseason2/videos\n\nSubscribe to the ABS-CBN's The Voice channel! - https://www.youtube.com/user/TheVoiceABSCBN\n\nFor more updates visit our official website! \nhttp://thevoice.abs-cbn.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheVoiceABSCBN\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheVoiceABSCBN\n\nInstagram: @ABSCBNTheVoice", "title": "The Voice of the Philippines Blind Auditions \u201cDiamonds\u201d by Rufami (Season 2)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-09T13:20:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "4oWcvwxsEIc", "description": "This Band-tailed Pigeon arrived on top of Monte Sano Mountain in Huntsville, Alabama on 11 April 2013.", "title": "Band-tailed Pigeon in Alabama", "publishedDate": "2013-04-15T00:50:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "4oXM0YQPr9I", "description": "Sorry for my little crawl in the beginning, anyways, I hope you all understand how to make a swimmable duck tape mermaid tail!

We chose this topic because we found the steps of photosynthesis rather complicated and figured that centering our project around them would help us better understand the process. Additionally, we were drawn to this topic because photosynthesis is the only process on earth that converts light energy into chemical energy! To start, a photon of light of the appropriate wavelength hits the chloroplast molecule. Then, chlorophyll molecule absorbs the energy from the photon. Next, one electron from the chlorophyll molecule goes out of orbit. At this point, the chlorophyll molecule has been oxidized (meaning it has lost an electron) and the accessory protein grabs an electron from a nearby water molecule to replace the lost electron. Now that the water molecule has lost an electron, it becomes unstable and falls apart. Photoloysis, the process where photosynthesis gives off water ensues. Oxygen goes out and the electron the water molecule lost is passed to the cytochrome. The excited cytochrome pumps protons from the stroma across the thylakoid membrane. The protons build up in the thylakoid space and form a chemiosmotic gradient. Once the thylakoid space reaches a pH of 5, the protein complex ATP synthase opens up a little tube that the protons rush through while they carry enormous amounts of energy. Energy carried by escaping protons phosphorolates ADP to produce ATP. Using candy made the process of photosynthesis a treat to learn about!", "title": "photoSWEEThesis", "publishedDate": "2008-12-01T22:57:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "4oZ1agluBCA", "description": "A mash-up of Escape the City by Crush 40 and the newer one from Sonic Generations!", "title": "Escape The City: Then and Now!", "publishedDate": "2014-06-12T06:28:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "4oZVPfuRTfk", "description": "www.kcarving.com\nThe clear and smokey quartz crystal Kings Knights Pawns are Njorthr (clear) and Vithar (smokey).

Fluffy T's music is loosely based on electronica and pop with aspects of noise and minimalism. 'Symbols of Immodesty' is included on the Clan Analogue compilation 'Defocus: Low Res Productions'.\n\nThree years in the making, Defocus brings together a hugely diverse collection of low resolution electronic productions from artists across Australia. Anti-production, incidental noise, low bit-rate recordings and analogue tape dropouts make sporadic appearances throughout the release, resulting in a CD that invites listeners to question their received notions of electronic production and to locate the sound inside the error messages.\n\n \n Buy CD direct from Clan \nBuy album from iTunes\n\n\nFrom the 8-bit loops of Adelaide's Parlour to the subterranean bass tones of Kazumichi Grime, the tempo-twisting digital manipulations of Two4K and on to the relentless white noise of Ars Electronica-veteran Alex Davies, Defocus charts a path through ambient, dub, minimalist techno, electro, noise and lofi. Each artist supplies their own practical critique of pre-ordained composition and production methodologies, thereby producing a CD that is both consistently listenable and fundamentally disjointed.\n\nWith the Defocus CD well-known names from the Clan Analogue stable including Prettyboy Crossover, Disco Stu, Deep Child and Dark Network join with Clan newcomers such as Two4K and Fluffy T (both of Melbourne super-group Futile Sound of Brunswick), Terry Nation, Shimmer and Able Child. Tolchok, Zog, Clowns Smiling Backwards, Winduptoys and Evan on Earth complete the Defocus lineup of electronic sound artisans.\n\n\"A quirky collection of airs and ambiences with a minimal chilled agenda, the perfect soundtrack for those more comatose moments in the early parts of the morning\"\nInpress Magazine", "title": "Fluffy T Bunny - Symbols of Immodesty", "publishedDate": "2011-05-24T02:13:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "4o_409dQSho", "description": "Listen and you will hear the strange noise of Cory's Shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) at night, S\u00e3o Miguel, Azores.\nThey are out at sea by day and comes to the rocks at night and they make this noise.

The Mutual repulsion showcased in all observations found in his models is due to the sex divided spinning electric rings which give form to all heavenly bodies, not to Gravity or magnetism as claimed by academic theories.\n\nGravity is points and shafts of stillness which control spiraling electric rings. They are divided by an equator where male rings spin above the equator in the N hemisphere and female rings spin below the equator in the S hemisphere (in the same direction). They appear to our senses to be spinning in opposite directions from N and S pole perspectives; however, they're spinning in 1 direction only.\nMagnetism is cathode planes of stillness which control the spinning electric rings. They give form to all so-called matter and substance from atoms to galaxies.\n\nThe N gravity pole has male rings which spin in a manner that repel all other N male electric rings. They will not mate with other N male spinning electric rings, otherwise falsely known as magnetic attraction in academic theory. The S gravity pole has female spinning electric rings which will not mate with other S female spinning electric rings and are mutually repulsive as well.\n\nThe reason so--called magnets appear to attract each other is because the male N rings of one magnet spin in the same direction as the S female rings of another magnet. They seek each other as mates to find the balance of rest or stillness in their mating. The effect is not attraction it is VOIDANCE. The meeting of these 2 opposite poles, creates a new cathode plane of stillness when they meet. The cause is electric not magnetic.\n\nIf you invert gravity bars, so-called magnets, so that either N poles face each other or female N poles face each other, their spinning electric rings will be spinning in opposite directions; therefore they will not mate and will be driven away from each other by mutual repulsion.\n\nMagnetism is cathode planes of stillness which control the spiraling electric rings which are the true cause of so called magnetism. Electricity is the only force in the Universe.\n\nThe claims made by Wright that his work supports einstein's curved space & time theory is fallacious because the effects showcased in his many models have nothing to do with gravity pushing or pulling. Gravity is points and shafts of stillness which control the spiraling sex divided rings of all bodies from atoms to galaxies. All of these effects are due to electric force only. Light does not bend due to gravitational force as einstein claimed, because gravity is not a force. Light curves around bodies like our Sun due to the electric lenses of changing electric potential that give it form and the consequent atmospheric lenses which also play a role in curving the motions of light as it repeats itself from wave field to wave field of space.\nAll of these models and observations confirm Walter and Lao Russell's Science and are explained in great detail by it.\n\nThese vids are related & shed more light on Wright's models:\n\nTEC 9 Magnetic Cubes & Electric Spheres of Creation\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DeGQrLVrmY\n\nTEC 10 Inert Gases\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Llyvy8Y7OU\n\nTEC 11 Magnetic-Electric, Cubic Wave-field\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEF7WHOdpgo\n\nTEC 12 Unseen Octaves of Space Gases (Aether)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeepum46j4U\n\nTEC 13a Electric Light Lenses of Creation\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTcYGRktnTM\n\nTEC 13b Electric Lenses\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7MLKoIQc_4\n\nTEC 14 Creator's Omnipotent Energy\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7785dqk1zrU\n\nTEC 15 - Creator's Omnipresent Love\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOrp67AIBeM\n\nTEC 16 - Creator's Still White Magnetic Light of Omniscience\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDuq2zj8kOs\n\nMatt Presti & Robert Otey w/ Santos Bonacci\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwKmoaSHigo\n\n20 books by Russell:\nhttp://www.scribd.com/my_document_collections/2873582\n\nDr. Bhat's Memorial Page\nhttp://www.feandft.com/Dr.%20Bhat.htm\n\nOAHSPE\nhttp://www.angelfire.com/in2/oahspe3/cosmo.html\n\nZ axis & the Solar System\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m6AEiAMb9g\n\nJon DePew's Site\nhttp://www.CoralCastleCode.com\n\nResonant Nuclear Battery\nhttp://www.rexresearch.com/nucell/nucell.htm\n\nDB Larson\nhttp://www.reciprocalsystem.com/dbl\n\nBooks on Suppressed Sciences\nhttp://www.scribd.com/my_document_collections/3113156\n\nHistory of Mainstream Fallacies\nhttp://www.wbabin.net/ntham/amesbury.pdf\n\nPhysics Myths vs Facts:\nhttp://www.physicsmyths.org.uk\n\nTrouble with Relativity\nhttp://www.gsjournal.net/old/physics/marcus.htm\n\nWalter Russell Album:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150220576998302.310244.683583301&type=3", "title": "Gravity is a Push 24c - WC Wright & Russellian Science", "publishedDate": "2013-01-21T23:11:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "4otQc_OotqA", "description": "Have you ever heard about the Bulgarian Institute of Metrology?

Desire of keeping beautiful empty glass bottles to make a second use of them made us start working on this idea. To begin with, we did some research and found out that bottles can be cut. As this idea caught our eyes, we started to experiment with it. Lots of damaged bottles and different prototypes were made until we got to the point, where we had a useful bottle cutting tool. After showing it around and giving to some people handmade gifts, made from old bottles, we were ensured by others that this could be something more than just a home project for ourselves. We did some improvements on the technical and visual side and now the C&C Bottle Cutter is ready to meet the crowd. To make it as successful as possible,  we are asking your help and support to start manufacturing. We are really excited to share it with you here, on Kickstarter.\n\nC&C is a glass bottle cutter, which is designed to cut any diameter bottle super easy, fast and precisely at home.\n\nWith C&C you can create glasses, vases, candlesticks, lamp pendants, ashtrays and even aquariums.", "title": "The Bottle Cutter || KickStarter.", "publishedDate": "2014-03-19T18:32:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ovgccxfEq8", "description": "This was a project I had to do for college.

Patients also can become more empowered by learning to hypnotize themselves at home to reduce chronic pain, improve sleep, or alleviate some symptoms of depression or anxiety.\n\nIn one study, Montgomery and colleagues tested the effectiveness of a 15-minute pre-surgery hypnosis session versus an empathic listening session in a clinical trial with 200 breast cancer patients. In a 2007 article in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (Vol. 99, No. 17), the team reported that patients who received hypnosis reported less post-surgical pain, nausea, fatigue and discomfort. The study also found that the hospital saved $772 per patient in the hypnosis group, mainly due to reduced surgical time. Patients who were hypnotized required less of the analgesic lidocaine and the sedative propofol during surgery.\n\n\"Hypnosis helps patients to reduce their distress and have positive expectations about the outcomes of surgery,\" Montgomery says. \"I don\u2019t think there is any magic or mind control.\"\nResearch has also shown the benefits of hypnosis for burn victims. In a 2007 report in Rehabilitation Psychology (Vol. 52, No. 3), Shelley Wiechman Askay, PhD, David R. Patterson, PhD, and colleagues at the University of Washington Medical School found that hypnosis before wound debridements significantly reduced pain reported by patients on one pain rating questionnaire.\n\nA hypnotic trance is not therapeutic in and of itself, but specific suggestions and images fed to clients in a trance can profoundly alter their behavior. As they rehearse the new ways they want to think and feel, they lay the groundwork for powerful changes in their future actions. For example, in hypnosis, I often tell people who are trying to quit smoking that they will go hours without even thinking of a cigarette, that if they should light up, the cigarette will taste terrible and they'll want to put it out immediately. I'll talk them through the imagery of being a nonsmoker--some combination of finding themselves breathing easier, having more energy for exercise, enjoying subtle tastes and smells again, having fresh breath and clean-smelling closing, feeling good about their health, even saving money on cigarettes or whatever motivates that person to quit. The deep relaxation of a hypnotic trance is also broadly beneficial as many illnesses, both psychological or physical, are aggravated by anxiety and muscle tension.\n\nI am a Clinical Hypnotherapist, I have been a hypnotherapist for 6 years and have a full-time practice. I work with clients for weight loss, sports performance, stop smoking, stress management, anxiety and pain management. I will ask you questions regarding what you are wanting to make changes for, and then write a personalized hypnosis session for you and make it into a MP3.

I planed it down to where it just fit in the slot with out wiggling but still could slide easily back and forth.  I attached the rail parallel to the shorter side of the plywood.  Then I trimmed off the shorter side closest to the blade to make that edge of the plywood perfectly parallel to the slot in the table saw.  Next I attached a stop to the back of the plywood piece with one screw. I made this stop as perpendicular to the table saw blade as I could.  Then I cut a test piece of plywood with the sled.

Von der handschuh\u00e4hnlichen Passform zum texturierten Obermaterial -- jedes Element wurde f\u00fcr Spitzenspiele und hohe Geschwindigkeiten entworfen.\n\nAll Conditions Control\n\nAll Conditions Control-Technologie (ACC) sorgt sowohl bei nassen als auch bei trockenen Bedingungen f\u00fcr optimale Ballkontrolle.\n\nObermaterial f\u00fcr hohe Geschwindigkeiten\n\nDas weiche, texturierte Obermaterial passt sich der Form des Fu\u00dfes an und sorgt so eine reaktionsfreudige Passform und Kontrolle bei hohen Geschwindigkeiten. Durchgehende Mikrokerben reduzieren den Luftwiderstand und verbessern das Ballgef\u00fchl.\n\nUltimative Traktion\n\nDirekt eingespritzte Stollen erm\u00f6glichen optimale Bodenhaftung f\u00fcr hervorragende Traktion und explosive Geschwindigkeit in alle Richtungen. Das asymmetrische Vapor-Traktionsprofil erm\u00f6glicht schnelle Antritte und Richtungswechsel. Die von Sprintschuhen inspirierten Stollenzonen am Vorderfu\u00df bieten Traktion bei Zehenabsto\u00df f\u00fcr schnelle Antritte. Ein Mittelfu\u00dfstollen verbessert die Beschleunigung und den Halt f\u00fcr schnelle Sprints.\n\nHalt und Stabilit\u00e4t\n\nDer Mercurial Vapor IX bietet ein durchgehendes Chassis mit doppellagiger Glasfaserkompositschicht f\u00fcr eine direkte Kraft\u00fcbertragung auf die Stollen.

Small toe-off traction at the tip of the forefoot make instant bursts of speed easier. \n\nmusic:\nLoveKavi - Mozart Flocka Flame \nProduced and Created by LoveKavi - @ www.LoveKavi.com\nwww.facebook.com/lovekavi\nhttp://lovekavi.newgrounds.com/audio", "title": "2014 Ibrahimovic Boots: Nike Mercurial Vapor IX Unboxing by freekickerz", "publishedDate": "2014-03-05T14:08:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "4p72nsLntEg", "description": "Official 'In Luna' Teaser For Upcoming 4 Way Split Album 'Urban Negativism' With Psychonaut 4 / Ofdrykkja / Vanhelga.\n\nOfficial 'In Luna' Facebook Page \nhttps://www.facebook.com/InLunaOfficial \n\nGenre : Post Depressive Black Metal", "title": "In Luna - Urban Negativism (Teaser)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-23T17:36:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "4p74Xw6s1To", "description": "Get those medical secrets: http://www.health101.pw/Medical-Secrets.shtml\n\nThis video shows you how to say or pronounce Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor.\n\nAudio is from cancer.gov.", "title": "How to Say or Pronounce Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor", "publishedDate": "2013-08-10T04:46:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "4p7GQgPjlEY", "description": "Einst zogen sie zu Millionen UEber die Ebenen Nordamerikas, wanderten ueber tausende Meilen von Nord nach Sued und zurueck, auf der Suche nach den besten Weidegruenden.\n\nJahrtausendelang waren die Bisons die unumstrittenen Herrscher der Prairie, zu gross um sich vor Raubtieren fuerchten zu muessen, zu zahlreich, um von den wenigen Menschen in Gefahr gebracht zu werden.

For more on this and other aspects of German grammar visit my website http://www.tenthingsgerman.com\n\nIf you've ever done a bit of Latin, you will have come across the idea of case. If not - well, as English doesn't really have case, this will be something new to you! In German nouns can be one of four cases depending on how they are used in a sentence. This doesn't change the noun (there is an exception, but we'll cover this) but does change the word for the or a. Pronouns (he, she, it, etc) are affected by case.\n\nThe aim of the website tenthingsgerman.com and the associated YouTube channel is to offer simple and understandable explanations of German grammar and, as the name suggests, it focuses on the ten key things you really need to know about. Sometimes, in the interests of keeping things simple, the odd grammatical corner has been cut and there is a bit more to the total of German grammar than you will find here. But, if you are a beginner or intermediate learner of the German language, you will find that knowing these ten things will get you by. 10 things german doesn't set out to teach you vocabulary - it's just about grammar.\n\nPlease be aware that the videos have no soundtrack. This is deliberate, so that they may be used in the classroom by teachers who can provide their own commentary.

Bekijk dan eens deze receptvideo en bekijk hoe je beenham met sinaasappel maakt. \n\nBeenham uit de oven met sinaasappel:\nRasp de oranje schil van een schoongeboende sinaasappel en pers de vrucht uit. Snijd het steeltje van de rode peper [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbhausTf9Qw] en verwijder de zaadlijsten. Snijd het vruchtvlees fijn.\n\nBeenham marineren\nNeem de beenham van ongeveer 600 gram uit de aluminium schaal. Meng in de schaal het sinaasappelrasp en -sap met de peper, 100 gram bruine basterdsuiker en 1 eetlepel koolzaadolie puur, tot de suiker is opgelost. Leg de ham terug in de schaal en wentel door de marinade. Dek af met aluminiumfolie en laat 2 uur in de koelkast marineren. Keer halverwege. \n\nVerwarm tijdig de oven voor op 175 graden. \nHaal de ham uit de koelkast, verwijder het aluminiumfolie en bak de ham in het midden van de oven in ongeveer 55 minuten gaar. Keer halverwege. Bedruip regelmatig met de marinade. \n\nTip: Als de beenham snel bruin wordt maar van binnen nog niet gaar genoeg is, kun je opnieuw aluminiumfolie over de ovenschaal leggen om nog meer verkleuring te voorkomen.\nNeem de ham uit de oven en dek af met aluminiumfolie. Laat 5 minuten rusten.\n\nSnijd de ham in dunne plakken en serveer.\n\nZo maak je beenham uit de oven met sinaasappel.

If you are inspired by this video please make a donation using the Donate button on the right. The David Lynch Foundation runs entirely on donations and there is a long list of schools and organizations eager to participate. Change begins within!\n\nFor more information on how to learn the Transcendental Meditation technique, please visit http://www.tm.org?leadsource=CRM1262\n\nNorman Rosenthal, M.D. (Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, Georgetown University Medical School): Homelessness in our country is a huge problem. About three and a half million people are homeless, of whom 30% have been released from prison and 40% have actually been veterans who have fought on our behalf. These are people who really are down and out and they need our help. And we do have shelters, but we need more than shelters. We need some way to help them get back on track again. There is extensive research to show that Transcendental Meditation can help addictions across the board. Whether you're talking about cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, or the use of illicit drugs, there are many studies that show that TM programs decrease the numbers of people who are addicted in these ways. And that has huge implications because we know that addictions can lead to homelessness, addictions can lead to crime and incarceration. So if we can do something that reduces addiction, we can help the individuals and society in a number of important ways. And this is something that TM does, it helps people organize their thinking, organize their prioroties so they don't do the same things again and again that got them to be homeless in the first place.\n\nhttp://davidlynchfoundation.org/donate", "title": "Homelessness and Addiction Decrease with Transcendental Meditation", "publishedDate": "2010-12-08T16:30:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4pMXwzYzvo8", "description": "Phoca Waddentochten Vieland Meivakantie 2013\nFoto's van het schip, de mensen en de tochten", "title": "Phoca Waddentochten Vieland Meivakantie 2013", "publishedDate": "2014-01-02T17:57:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "4pMw9l1Ru_w", "description": "QUESTA NUOVA UCRAINA MASSONICA, SORGE SUI CADAVERI INNOCENTI, CHE, I CECCHINI DELLA CIA, HANNO FATTO, ottenuto, sparando su chiunque!

Likewise, this BBC News reporter failed to linked the more than 100,000 murders that have occurred in Venezuela during the 9-year rule of the Chavista Government with the murder of political dissidents, most of whom are not very important political figures, who are persecuted and murdered by paramilitary groups similar to this one, which are formed by civilians, common criminals and state security agents; murders which the government reports as \"common criminal murders\" but those are the executions of the 21st Century that ORVEX has been demouncing since its foundation, in April of 2005. \n\nDue to its informative work, in favor of Freedom and Democracy, and for promoting the non violent struggle techniques of Mr. Gene Sharp. from the Albert Einstein Institution in the U.S., ORVEX (Organization of Venezuelans in Exile) was declared a \"Terrorist Organization\" by the Venezuelan Government in May of 2007.\n\nHugo Chavez is a threat to the National Security of the United States. There is a direct flight between Teheran (Iran) and Caracas (Venezuela); there are HEZBOLLAH cells in Venezuela, and Islamic terrorists who have received Venezuelan passports who will enter into the U.S. if they get U.S. Visas.\n\nHugo Chavez is a communist and an enemy of the United States.

From the 19th to the mid-20th century there was hardly a puppet play in which he did not feature. He was the compulsory protagonist of hundreds, possibly thousands of plays that are now largely unperformable. In one of them, Punch was sent forward into the 30th century, in another he was sent to the Moon, or at least on a journey around the world, and in several plays our little hero went to America. Just as he does in the play (only 7 years old) which we chose in the end. It was written in 2000 for the Brno theatre Pol\u00e1rka by Ji\u0159\u00ed Skovajsa (born 1965), an actor in the company. Skovajsa also directed, designed and played three roles in the production at the Pol\u00e1rka theatre.\n\nHis charmingly naive text manages to combine a typical Czech environment with an American one. A friendly squabble between the brash know-it-all Punch and the country bumpkin \u0160krhola (another favourite character in traditional Czech puppet theatre) results in Punch sailing off to America (in \u0160krhola's washtub). There he manages to tame the terrible bear Grizzly, and as a result briefly finds himself the honoured guest of the Kofeetee Indians, with their chief Hollow Horn. Punch - christened Ringing Head by the Indians - 'cures' the chief's daughter, and helps two lovers. Then he returns home, to make mischief for \u0160krhola and all sorts of other people. In passing, we may find ourselves thinking that 'there's no such thing as a free lunch.'\nThe producers went for the tried and tested 'action' glove puppets, which, as is well known, never spoil the fun. The artistic stylisation echoes Yogi Bear-style American cartoons of the 1960s. We believe this comedy with songs will be enjoyed by small people - and maybe by big ones as well.", "title": "Divadlo ALFA, J.Skovajsa: KA\u0160P\u00c1REK A INDI\u00c1NI", "publishedDate": "2008-09-14T22:56:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "4pZrC_hI07s", "description": "PROTEIN BAR RECIPE: http://buffdudes.blogspot.com/2014/06/how-to-make-homemade-quest-protein-bars.html\n\nSpecial thanks to The Diet Kitchen - https://www.youtube.com/thedietkitchen.
