I get emails often from friends after they have painted a piece and they complain they have blotchy paint or they have a segmented appearance in their paint. I then explain that although the paint is self- leveling, you need to help it. This is especially important if you prefer a traditional smooth look.\n\nFor example, if painting the top of a 5 foot wide side bar. I would apply the paint across of it in sections. Once I have paint covering from one side to another, I go back quickly with my brush and complete a final finish stroke where I lay the paint with one solid pass from one side all the way to the other without lifting my brush. This incorporates the \"sections\" I just painted individually and removes all of those disjointed brush marks. Keep in mind that Chalk Paint\u00ae dries 50% faster than latex- so you must do this as you proceed through your painting versus waiting till you are done getting paint all over an entire side. By then, paint may have started to dry and you run the risk of pulling it and giving it texture.  If this helped you- you may want to visit my website at www.ThePurplePaintedLady.com and look under the \"Tips For Chalk Paint\u00ae\" page at other information I have there for you.

Jones\nFilm Description: Night Watch director Timur Bekmambetov helms his first English-language feature film with this big-screen adaptation of Mark Millar's action-packed graphic novel. Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a cube-dwelling hypochondriac whose uneventful life has become a mundane blur of terminal boredom. Repeatedly humiliated by his boss and constantly cuckolded by his cheating girlfriend, weakling Wes seems to be living right down to everyone's expectations that he would never amount to anything in life. However, upon discovering that the father he never knew has been brutally murdered, the spineless, clock-punching pushover is recruited into a secret society of assassins known as the Fraternity. During the course of his training, the man who was once an office-bound wimp develops lightning-fast reflexes and superhuman dexterity courtesy of his skilled mentor Fox (Angelina Jolie). Upon completing his training, Wes is assigned the task of dealing out death to the mythological Fates, who possess the ability to alter the lifelines of mortal men. It isn't long before the nebbish nerd-turned-agile assassin is erasing the bad guys with surprising efficiency, yet as Wes begins to carry the mantle passed down to him by his father, he gradually begins to suspect that his wise tutors are not the crime-fighting enforcers they present themselves to be. Now, with everything he ever wanted in life finally within his grasp, Wes is about to find out that the only thing more difficult than ending the lives of others is summoning the courage to take control of his own.\n\nwanted,\"wanted clip\",\"wanted full movie\",\"wanted dead or alive\",\"james mcavoy\",\"marc warren\",\"timur bekmambetov\",\"window videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"crime action adventure\",\"action adventure\",\"comic books and superheroes\",\"roger birnbaum\",\"gary barber\",\"david minkowski\",\"marc e platt\",\"matthew stillman\",\"adam siegel\",\"blair breard\",\"jim lemley\",\"iain smith\",\"jared leboff\",\"mark millar\",\"marc silvestri\",\"sally french\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++389654,/m/06mnps,/m/01jscz", "title": "Wanted (9/11) Movie CLIP - Wesley's Rampage (2008) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T12:33:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "37LD6JU0up0", "description": "EKa KV mutka ja viides sia!!", "title": "Perni\u00f6 14.6.

First-time feature director Yuval Adler spent years interviewing Shin Bet officers and Palestinian militants to create this complex, intelligent, and timely tragedy.\nOne of the most unnervingly lucid films to be made about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Yuval Adler's Bethlehem is a bold and bracing feature debut. Shifting between Israeli and Palestinian societies to tell its story of secret strategies, precarious alliances, and terrible betrayals, this gripping thriller plunges us into a milieu of family, terror, and espionage.\n\nAt the centre of Bethlehem's fraught geometries is Sanfur (Sahdi Marei), the little brother of wanted Palestinian militant Ibrahim (Hisham Suliman) \u2014 and an informant engaged by the Shin Bet, Israel's secret service. Sanfur was only fifteen when first recruited by Shin Bet officer Razi (Tsahi Halevi), and the two quickly developed an intimate, almost fraternal relationship, one that granted Sanfur more tenderness, respect, and attention than he ever found at home. Still, as Shin Bet's plot to assassinate Ibrahim heats up, Sanfur finds his loyalties hopelessly divided. Tensions escalate, leading to a brutal climax that offers no escape from the morass, but deepens our understanding of it.\n\nDror Moreh's Oscar-nominated documentary The Gatekeepers helped familiarize Western audiences with the complicated history of the Shin Bet. Bethlehem takes us one step closer. Adler, who worked for Israeli army intelligence for several years, co-wrote the script with Ali Waked, a Muslim journalist. The two conducted interviews with Shin Bet officers, and Palestinian militants from al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and Hamas. Years of research went into developing this complex, intelligent, and timely tragedy. It will have you talking, and thinking, long after the end credits roll \u2014 and pondering the human price of conflict everywhere. \n\nJANE SCHOETTLE\n\nhttp://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/festival/2013/bethlehem", "title": "BETHLEHEM Clip | Festival 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-08-21T19:34:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "37P_u1hKSaU", "description": "Over the past three years, filmmaker Andrew Napier captured an up close and personal account of Cenk and his team while filming behind the scenes at The Young Turks.  \"Mad As Hell\" reveals the struggles Cenk has had to endure to become the host of a national television show as well as his mission to reform campaign financing to fix a broken political system.

From her home in Hawaii she had everyday access to some of the world's best waves and basked in the warmth of a loving family. But her tranquil beach surf life was shattered one morning when a shark completely bit off her arm. Only the immediate help of her friends, heroic work by doctors and an overwhelming peace kept her alive in the critical moments after the attack.

Todo sobre fisioterapia.\nLa tendinitis del tibial anterior no es una de las m\u00e1s t\u00edpicas en el cuerpo humano, pero cuando se da puede ser realmente molesta.\nOs muestro en este v\u00eddeo un automasaje para realizarse un auto tratamiento que junto con otras t\u00e9cnicas puede ayudar a solucionar este problema.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 ES\nEl patinador durante gran parte de la t\u00e9cnica est\u00e1 en la posici\u00f3n de la flexi\u00f3n de las extremidades inferiores de unos 110 \u00b0, adem\u00e1s, mediante la realizaci\u00f3n de una manera repetitiva la fase de recuperaci\u00f3n del pat\u00edn, realiza un movimiento con el pie en supinaci\u00f3n fuerte y la rotaci\u00f3n interna.\nEsta acci\u00f3n se produce por una intensa contracci\u00f3n de los m\u00fasculos: tibial anterior, extensor del dedo y su extensor de los dedos. El gesto hizo en un largo e intenso entrenamiento, especialmente en v\u00edas elevadas y las curvas (paso cruzado) aumenta en gran medida el esfuerzo muscular, que es la causa de una inflamaci\u00f3n de los m\u00fasculos mencionados anteriormente resulta en hiperemia y edema de la cara anterior de la pierna, resultando en un aumento de la presi\u00f3n que se opone al compartimiento fascial inel\u00e1stica demostr\u00f3 con la manometr\u00eda a agosto\n\nEl aumento de la presi\u00f3n intra-compartimental por encima de un cierto valor reduce el flujo de sangre que causa dolores musculares y sensaci\u00f3n de hinchaz\u00f3n isqu\u00e9mica (\"como si se rompi\u00f3\") y requiere que el atleta se detenga.\nEl s\u00edndrome compartimental en las pulsaciones arteriales suelen ser conservados, y los vasos que est\u00e1n colapsando, probablemente, las arterias m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as y los capilares intramusculares. Incluso los nervios que pasan a trav\u00e9s del compartimiento anterior pueda sufrir como consecuencia de la isquemia, causando entumecimiento de los pies.\nEn reposo no se observaron signos f\u00edsicos, aparte de cierta inflamaci\u00f3n de un m\u00fasculo ( Figura 2 ). El diagn\u00f3stico diferencial incluye las fracturas por estr\u00e9s de la tibia, la tenosinovitis del tibial anterior, el dolor de la tibia medial (\"calambres en las piernas\") y hematomas por v\u00eda intramuscular.\nLa sintomatolog\u00eda es m\u00e1s pronunciado en contra de la pierna derecha, ya que esto es m\u00e1s hincapi\u00e9 en curva (paso en\u00e9rgico casaci\u00f3n) y si la pista es elevada (debido a la inclinaci\u00f3n de la curva de la pista se ve obligado a pagar una mayor flexi\u00f3n dorsal con un componente de la pronaci\u00f3n).\nEl s\u00edntoma se produce cuando la pierna izquierda es el patinaje en la pista plana, con curvas de peque\u00f1o tama\u00f1o y \"apretado\" (como en el caso de las competiciones indoor): ya que el atleta para mejorar la estabilidad en las curvas se ve obligado a una disminuci\u00f3n significativa de las artes inferior, la extremidad inferior izquierda se \"carga\" m\u00e1s a la inclinaci\u00f3n de la parte superior del cuerpo hacia el interior.\n \nCOMO PU \u00d2 CURE\nLa mayor\u00eda de los pacientes responden bien al tratamiento conservador que consiste en \"reposo activo\" durante al menos dos semanas y en un tratamiento con hielo en n\u00famero y en tiempo adecuado en funci\u00f3n de la severidad de los s\u00edntomas. En los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha sido una herramienta desarrollada la terapia electro, TECAR, que est\u00e1 dando excelentes resultados. Es evidente que la reanudaci\u00f3n de las carreras se debe permitir despu\u00e9s de analizar las causas que desencadenan los s\u00edntomas que hicieron, mediante la implementaci\u00f3n de la \"correcci\u00f3n\" el cumplimiento adecuado y con el acto de graduaci\u00f3n. Incluso ultrasonido son \u00fatiles para reducir la inflamaci\u00f3n, mientras que para reducir los AINE dolor se pueden administrar por v\u00eda oral.

Schofield, Alisa Tager\nScreenwriter: Jean-Jacques Annaud, Alain Godard\nFilm Description: A turning point in 20th century war history is the focus of this fact-based account of the 1942-1943 battle of Stalingrad, in which the Germans were finally defeated by Russian influence -- one of the bloodiest battles in World War II history. The film stars Jude Law as Vassili, a marksman from the Urals who is transported to Stalingrad in 1942, and a master German sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris). Koenig, an expert German sniper, is determined to eliminate his formidable opponent by any means necessary; meanwhile, Vassili has joined forces with Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), a young Russian political adversary, who is impressed by Vassili's skills and raises his profile in the Soviet Union. Both Vassili and Danilov become involved with Tanya (Rachel Weisz), whose Jewish parents have been captured by the Germans and have forced her to take up with the men on a sniper expedition. Koenig and Vassili begin to develop traps for each other, until fate inevitably must bring the two sharpshooters together. This large-scale production, financed mostly by Teuton companies, also features Bob Hoskins as Nikita Krushchev and Ron Perlman as an aging Russian sniper.\n\n\"enemy at the gates\",\"enemy at the gates clip\",\"enemy at the gates part 1\",\"enemy at the gates trailer\",\"joseph fiennes\",\"bob hoskins\",\"markus majowski\",\"peter silbereisen\",war,drama,\"history social studies\",thriller,\"john d schofield\",\"roland pellegrino\",\"alisa tager\",\"jean-jacques annaud\",\"alain godard\",\"jrg reichl\",\"disappointment videos\",\"hope videos\",\"patriotism videos\",\"war videos\",\"boat videos\",\"russia videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++237768,/m/0m31m,/m/015vq_,/m/0fq3t0c", "title": "Enemy at the Gates (4/9) Movie CLIP - Nikita Khrushchev (2001) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-23T17:17:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "381ezmmw8HE", "description": "", "title": "Jd's fight 006.MOV", "publishedDate": "2009-12-15T00:37:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "382IQ8SveH0", "description": "Effective passing soccer drills are an essential element of each and every soccer players skills and must be practiced early in every soccer players life.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDescription:\nfirst player from each group plays a wall pass with the player to his right\nafter receiving the ball back he lays it off to next player as shown\n\nVariation:\nspecify how players must pass/ receive (left or right foot, inside or outside foot etc.)\nadjust spacing depending on the age and ability of the group \n\nCoaching Points:\nweight of pass\naccuracy\nfirst touch\neye contact\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMain Website With Additional Drills: \nhttp://www.top-soccer-drills.com/\n\nDownload Your Free PDF Of The Drill Above Here: \nhttp://www.top-soccer-drills.com/wall-passes--2.html\n\n900+ Soccer Drills In Pdf Format Just $9.99:\nhttp://www.top-soccer-drills.com/store/p5/900__SOCCER_DRILLS_PACK.html\n\n\nDo you shop at Amazon?\nBy Clicking On The Following Link Before Your Next Purchase You Can Support Us And Keep Our Free Service Going Without Additional Cost To You.\nHelp By Clicking The Link Below:\nhttp://amzn.to/TayAZs\n\n\nFollow Me For More Free Information Here:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/topsoccerdrills\nhttp://www.pinterest.com/topsoccerdrills/\nhttps://twitter.com/TOPSOCCERDRILL\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/105242004605784617657", "title": "Practice With The Best Passing Drill In Soccer", "publishedDate": "2014-06-20T02:01:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "382e6xibNfQ", "description": "Rig Veda Book 1 HYMN III.

Dependent on one another for survival in their strange and dangerous new home, the two form an unlikely alliance as they alternately elude or confront the thieves and cutthroats that bad luck has made their companions and captors. After an act of terrible violence, the teacher is brought before the ship's captain and instructed to use his literary skills to aid him in writing his memoirs. He is to serve as scribe for a man who, in his remaining years, has made it his mission to commit as many acts of evil as possible in order to ensure that he meet his dead wife in hell. As the captain's protected confidant, finding his only comfort in the few books afforded him, the teacher bears witness to monstrous brutality, relentless cruelty, strange wisdom, and a journey of redemption through loss of faith.\n\nAdvance Praise:\n\n\"I could not have imagined how impressive a work Blacklung would turn out to be. It's a graphic novel, both in its vernacular term and in a more literal sense, violent and horrible and poetic at the same time -- the sort of thing McCarthy might write if he were more interested in pirates than cowboys or Appalachians. Blacklung is a great book; canonically great.\" \u2014Chris Schweizer (Crogan's Adventures)\n\n\"A truly organic and interesting way to cartoon, the complete package of verbal cadence and informative visual style.\" -- Tom Spurgeon, The Comics Reporter", "title": "Blacklung by Chris Wright - video preview", "publishedDate": "2012-09-21T04:18:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "38BomdzhZjA", "description": "Cambodian small arms\nList:\nAK-47: along with the Type 56 and AKM, one of the most deadly rifle in the world!\nType 56\nAKM\nSKS\nQBZ-97A\nQBZ-97B\nRPK\nRPD\nPKM\nRPG-2\nRPG-7\nType 69 RPG\nSG-43\nDShK\nW85", "title": "Cambodian small arms", "publishedDate": "2009-06-07T12:22:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "38CacmvFvvM", "description": "Der Beifahrer wurde zur Kontrolle ins Krankenhaus gebracht.\nThe codriver was taken to control the hospital.\n\nSTR", "title": "Big Mini Cooper Crash Unfall Nordschleife N\u00fcrburgring Touristenfahrt 07.09.2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-07T18:56:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "38CkKrak5o8", "description": "From the \"knowing\" soundtrack", "title": "Knowing- Main Theme", "publishedDate": "2009-03-24T21:00:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "38CyXg5ExL4", "description": "Revivez les meilleurs moments de AS Saint-Etienne - FC Metz (1-0) en vid\u00e9o.\n\nLigue 1 - Saison 2014/2015 - 11\u00e8me journ\u00e9e\n\nStade Geoffroy-Guichard - dimanche 26 octobre 2014\n\nButeurs : Max-Alain GRADEL (74' - AS Saint-Etienne) \n\nComposition AS Saint-Etienne : 2 - K\u00e9vin THEOPHILE CATHERINE / 6 - J\u00e9r\u00e9my CLEMENT / 7 - Max-Alain GRADEL / 10 - Renaud COHADE / 12 - Allan SAINT-MAXIMIN / 16 - St\u00e9phane RUFFIER / 21 - Romain HAMOUMA / 22 - K\u00e9vin MONNET-PAQUET / 24 - Lo\u00efc PERRIN (c) / 26 - Moustapha SALL / 27 - Franck TABANOU \n\nComposition FC Metz : 5 - Guido MILAN / 8 - Cheick DOUKOURE / 10 - Bouna SARR / 13 - Florent MALOUDA / 15 - Romain METANIRE (c) / 16 - Anthony MFA / 18 - J\u00e9r\u00e9my CHOPLIN / 23 - Yeni NGBAKOTO / 24 - Ga\u00ebtan BUSSMANN / 25 - Guirane NDAW / 29 - Siargei KRIVETS \n\nAbonnez-vous \u00e0 la cha\u00eene : http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ligue1fr \nSuivez nous sur LFP.fr : http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1 \nSuivez nous sur Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/ligue1 \nSuivez nous sur Google+ : https://plus.google.com/109005764583830637639 \nSuivez nous sur Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/LFPFr", "title": "AS Saint-Etienne - FC Metz (1-0)  - R\u00e9sum\u00e9 - (ASSE - FCM) / 2014-15", "publishedDate": "2014-10-26T23:00:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "38DA5TvZAjI", "description": "(Original)\nWe all need a dog like this...\nPlease feel free to leave a like and comment.\nFor Business Enquires: Lamarmy69@gmail.com", "title": "Burglar Escapes Savage Dog Attack!

Wel gaat hij praten met de branche en Justitie. Dat zei hij gisteren in de gemeenteraad na vragen van VVD-fractievoorzitter Robert Flos over de verkoop van drugs op fietstaxi's. Onlangs toonde Pownews aan dat je in Amsterdam coca\u00efne en XTC kunt kopen bij fietstaxichauffeurs.\n\nTwee Oost-Europese bestuurders werden na de uitzending ontslagen, maar het probleem blijft. Flos wilde weten of de burgemeester extra maatregelen neemt. \"Er zijn wel hogere prioriteiten dan dit\", zei Van der Laan. Hij wil geen extra onderzoek omdat dit 'teveel capaciteit' kost. \"Het aantal fietstaxi's is al gedaald. Als er een overtreding wordt begaan, kunnen we de vergunning van een fietstaxibedrijf intrekken.\"\n\nVerder gaat Van der Laan praten met de branche en zal hij het aankaarten bij de politie en Justitie. Maar voorlopig komen er geen extra maatregelen. VVD-raadslid Flos was tevreden. \"We moeten de burgemeester de ruimte geven en geen moord en brand schreeuwen.

It was inevitable, then, that a sequel would make an appearance. Surprisingly, Fletch Lives didn't come out until 1989--a full five years after the original. Once more, Chase stars as Irwin Maurice \"Fletch\" Fletcher, the gonzo investigative reporter created by novelist Gregory McDonald. Indulging his penchant for disguises and bizarre aliases, Fletch investigates a deep dark mystery at a crumbling Southern plantation.

Some late Roman sources reveal the existence of fishermen on the islands in the original marshy lagoons. They were referred to as incolae lacunae (\"lagoon dwellers\"). The traditional founding is identified with the dedication of the first church, that of San Giacomo at the islet of Rialto (Rivoalto, \"High Shore\"), which is said to have been at the stroke of noon on 25 March 421.\n \nThe last and most enduring immigration into the north of the Italian peninsula was that of the Lombards in 568, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire a small strip of coast in the current Veneto, including Venice. The Roman/Byzantine territory was organized as the Exarchate of Ravenna, administered from that ancient port and overseen by a viceroy (the Exarch) appointed by the Emperor in Constantinople, but Ravenna and Venice were connected only by sea routes and with the Venetians' isolated position came increasing autonomy. New ports were built, including those at Malamocco and Torcello in the Venetian lagoon. The tribuni maiores, the earliest central standing governing committee of the islands in the Lagoon, dated from c. 568.\nSource: wikipedia.org\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "title": "Venice 2, Italy, Collage Video - youtube.com/tanvideo11", "publishedDate": "2014-01-14T14:36:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "38Tkw4j5w0o", "description": "\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0\u304c\u3001\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u594f\u3067\u308b\u3002\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4 \"Blog Ground Music\" \u3092\u3001\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0\u3084\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u306b\u8cbc\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3066\u3001\u307f\u3093\u306a\u3067\u904a\u3093\u3067\u307f\u3066\u4e0b\u3055\u3044\u3002\nhttp://www.blog-ground-music.com/", "title": "Blog Ground Music\u306e\u904a\u3073\u65b9", "publishedDate": "2009-06-21T14:05:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "38U-c-ZYvPQ", "description": "Proposer moi des th\u00e8me pour mes prochain Speed Arts .\nVous pouvez propos\u00e9 des th\u00e8me qui porte sur le Gaming ou qui porte sur    \ndes Film puis je noterais tous les th\u00e8me et j'en ferais des speed arts par la suite .", "title": "Proposer des th\u00e8me pour mes prochain Speed Arts", "publishedDate": "2014-04-21T20:01:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "38U64J0pSGU", "description": "Marc Hauser, Redner | Keynote Speaker | Referent | f\u00fcr Ihren Event:\nhttp://www.erfolgswelle.ch/redner/redner-referent-speaker/\n\nAls Weltrekordhalter im Extrem-Fallschirmspringen flog er mit 304 Stundenkilometern \u00fcber eine ganze Stadt hinweg und ist damit der schnellste Mensch im horizontalen Freifall.\n\nAls Ideenk\u00fcnstler verkaufte er nach 20 Minuten seiner ersten Vernissage das zweitteuerste Bild - ohne wirklich malen zu k\u00f6nnen.\n\nAls Unternehmer baute er die Textagentur erfolgswelle\u00ae AG zur f\u00fchrenden Agentur in Europa auf - innerhalb von nur sechs Monaten.\n\nThemen im Vortrag:\n\n- Pers\u00f6nlichkeit und Erfolg: Das Prinzip\n- Innovation und Kreativit\u00e4t: Die Schl\u00fcssel\n- Angst\u00fcberwindung und Mut zum Risiko: Der Durchbruch\n- Gl\u00fcck & Flow: von Gl\u00fccksforschung bis Gl\u00fccks-Hype\n- Motivation dank Kommunikation: f\u00fcr Beruf und Privatleben\n- Change- und Risk Management beginnt: genau jetzt\n- Selbstverpflichtung: bis zum Weltrekord\n- Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsentwicklung: ganz pragmatisch\n\nRedner Marc Hauser jetzt buchen:\nhttp://www.erfolgswelle.ch/redner/redner-referent-speaker/", "title": "Redner + Referent mit Weltrekord: Motivation, Erfolg, Gl\u00fcck und Flow", "publishedDate": "2012-10-12T12:40:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "38UKKvFOr8o", "description": "Ritualiss \u00e8 il nuovo Rituale alla cheratina per un liscio naturale e duraturo da effettuare in salone e proseguire a casa per avere capelli sempre in ordine, facili da pettinare e dall'aspetto sano.", "title": "Elgon Ritualiss - A new keratin care (ita)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-02T16:14:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "38UPLxD2dFA", "description": "Nuestro homenaje a la etnia negra en misa de 830", "title": "Gloria misa afro", "publishedDate": "2011-05-29T14:16:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "38VH40yVbvQ", "description": "Macho Again holds on to take the Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga on Sunday, July 27, 2008.", "title": "2008 Jim Dandy Stakes", "publishedDate": "2008-07-28T02:32:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "38V_8Lr28Gw", "description": "", "title": "kid Drifting with mini car", "publishedDate": "2013-03-26T12:54:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "38VkjTR3ROA", "description": "THUMBS UP if you enjoyed this video!

Por pouco a sele\u00e7\u00e3o de Andorra n\u00e3o faz cair um tabu de dez anos sem vit\u00f3ria. O gol marcado logo no in\u00edcio do jogo animou o time da casa, que comemorou sua \u00faltimo vit\u00f3ria no dia 13 de outubro de 2004, no 1 a 0 contra a Antiga Rep\u00fablica Iugoslava da Maced\u00f4nia, nas Eliminat\u00f3rias europeias da Copa do Mundo de 2006. A equipe n\u00e3o contava, por\u00e9m, com o poder de decis\u00e3o de Gareth Bale, que, primeiro de cabe\u00e7a e depois de falta, virou a partida e garantiu a vit\u00f3ria do Pa\u00eds de Gales na estreia nas Eliminat\u00f3rias da Eurocopa 2016. \nAos 6 minutos de jogo, o zagueiro Lima, de p\u00eanalti, abriu o placar para os mandantes. Como era esperado, a sele\u00e7\u00e3o de Andorra recuou e deu espa\u00e7o para Bale comandar a rea\u00e7\u00e3o. Aos 22, o camisa 11, em uma bela cabe\u00e7ada, igualou o marcador. \nNa segunda etapa, a press\u00e3o foi tanta que os galeses chegaram a ter 76% da posse de bola, mas encontraram muitas dificuldades para furar o forte bloqueio formado pelos andorranos. Se com na troca de passes estava complicado achar espa\u00e7os, a bola parada foi o caminho perfeita para o meia-atacante do Real Madrid garantir a vit\u00f3ria. Em uma bela cobran\u00e7a de falta, aos 36 minutos, Bale fez o segundo, assegurando os tr\u00eas pontos para os visitantes.\nCom resultado, o Pa\u00eds de Gales assumiu a ponta do grupo B das Eliminat\u00f3rias, ao lado do Chipre, que venceu a B\u00f3snia, tamb\u00e9m por 2 a 1.", "title": "Gols, Andorra 1 x 2 Pa\u00eds de Gales -  Eliminat\u00f3rias Euro 09/09/2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-10T04:09:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "38WP7dm5UpE", "description": "Come ventilare un paziente con pallone AMBU", "title": "Ventilazione con pallone AMBU", "publishedDate": "2011-11-05T18:28:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "38WwPIkCNmM", "description": "Album: Inima Tare", "title": "Dagga - asfalt", "publishedDate": "2010-12-24T12:14:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "38XC_gsLI-g", "description": "For more Fresh Punjabi Videos | http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=htpunjabi\nSong:- Mandeer\nSinger:- Davinder Gill\nLyrics:- Davinder Gill\nComposer:- R Guru\nDirector: Jashan Nanarh\nEditor:- Sarabjeet Sohal\nCopyright :- LOKDHUN\n\nFacebook | http://www.facebook.com/LokdhunPunjabi\n\nSong Lyrics\nHoye Kar Layi +2 College Daakhla Rall Geya Vehleyan Da Naal Kaafla Hoye Kar Layi +2 College Daakhla Rall Geya Vehleyan Da Naal Kaafla Lai Leya Bullet Nawaa Kaale Rang Da\n\nOye Bann-Ne Nu Ghaint I-Phone Mangda Nakk Vich Ehne Damm Kareya Peya Mittro Mandeer Da Ta Sareya Peya Mittro Mandeer Da Ta Sareya Peya\n\nOye Dosto Mandeer Da Te...\n\nOye Mata Kehndi Putt Chitt Laa Ke Padhna Gall Ch Nahi Auna Kise Naal Nahi Ladna Oye Saab Hurin Phirde Aa Kann Chaadhde Jidher Nu Jaan Lalkaare Maarde\n\n\nOye Naagni Ne Kamm Set Kareya Peya Mittro Mandeer Da Ta Sareya Peya Mittro Mandeer Da Ta Sareya Peya Oye Dosto Mandeer Da Te...\n\nOye Dad Phirey Khetan Vich Nakke Modhda Putt Karey Railiyan Ghare Nahi Bauhd-Da Oye Dad Phirey Khetan Vich Nakke Modhda Putt Karey Railiyan Ghare Nahi Bauhd-Da Oye Ikko Aa Fikar Bas Rehnda Yaar Nu Laini Pardhaangi Aa Aundi Vaar Nu\n\nOh Leadri Da Bhoot Sir Chadheya Peya Mittro Mandeer Da Ta Sareya Peya Mittro Mandeer Da Ta Sareya Peya Oye Dosto Mandeer Da Te...\n\nHo Jihde Layi Brand Nitt Navein Paunda Ain Chandigarh Round Jihde Naal Launda Ain Jihde Layi Brand Nitt Navein Paunda Ain Ghar Tak Ohnu Chhad Ke Vi Aaunda Ain Jeb Ch Rupaiyya Nahio Peen Khaan Nu Lai Ke Aa Gift Par Dinda Jaan Nu\n\nOh Karza Vi Saareyan Ton Phadeya Peya Mittro Mandeer Da Ta Sareya Peya\n\nMittro Mandeer Da Ta Sareya Peya Oye Dosto Mandeer Da Te...\n\nOh Todna Nahi Dakka Mauj Vich Rehna Hai Naaga Wale Baabeyan Da Atal Kehna Hai Oh Todna Nahi Dakka Mauj Vich Rehna Hai\nEh Naaga Wale Baabeyan Da Atal Kehna Hai Samjh Nhi Aundi Ehdi Keeh Karda\n\nDass Kanjra Tu Kehde Vele Padhda Oh Mata Ne Support Gill Kareya Peya\n\nMajeethe Waleyan Da Oh Ta Sareya Peya Mittro Mandeer Da Ta Sareya Peya\n\nDosto Mandeer Da Ta Sareya Peya Mittro Mandeer Da Ta Sareya Peya", "title": "Mandeer - Davinder Gill - Latest Punjabi Song 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-03-24T05:39:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "38XZlZ5v4B4", "description": "***READ DESCRIPTION***\n\nSPECIAL THANKS to:\nOriginal Composer: Michael John Mollo\n\nGeno Anthony Lopez, for stems and the opportunity to make this.\nhttp://www.sumthing.com/blog/author/geno-anthony/\n\nDownload on Soundcloud and MediaFire:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/nick-gonzalez-16/strider-remix\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/listen/6ba0v6vvw78q6qb/Strider_Remix[v2.0].mp3\n\nFollow me on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/atpunkpage", "title": "Strider: Remix [Atpunk]", "publishedDate": "2014-03-31T15:57:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "38XomXO4Tog", "description": "Senior Research Associate Jennifer Chaky describes how to diagnose Southern and Common Rust in the field, focusing on differences between the two rusts and the importance of knowing the difference.\n\n2012 PHII", "title": "Southern and Common Rust in Corn", "publishedDate": "2012-10-08T15:11:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "38Xr904o0vU", "description": "The Just Us League has words for the SouthWest Xpress, pertaining to the XWW Tag Team Title match they have October 27th, 2012 at the Tremont Music Hall in Charlotte, NC!", "title": "Just Us League - SW Xpress' \"I Wish\" Sammich", "publishedDate": "2012-10-12T00:15:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "38XwRBEmxak", "description": "", "title": "baba yaga aka oedipal  101", "publishedDate": "2014-02-06T20:47:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "38YF_VoiCck", "description": "THIS IS THE REAL MODEL OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM \n\nSpiral vortex accurate model our solar system", "title": "Spiral vortex accurate model our solar system", "publishedDate": "2014-03-09T05:56:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "38YHA-3b-Ak", "description": "Spiritualizing away conflict is one of the top symptoms of emotionally unhealthy spirituality that some of us can identify with.

Compare to the other videos taken 2 weeks and 3 weeks prior, the vegetable and herb plants grow fast. This video is from 12/21/10, it's hard to believe it's December, the plants are growing as if it was March.\nThis video shows a close look of the tomato plants, all the herb plants like chives, basil, cilantro, mint and a few others, there are also cucumber, zucchini, squash, lettuce, micro greens and strawberry plants. Some of the plants we planted from seed on week 2 of the project and others like the older tomato and cucumber plants were brought from an older version of this vegetable hydrofarm. All of the vegetables grown are organic from hybrid seed.  \n\nThe greenhouse layout plan in this 8x12 hobby greenhouse offers 144 foot of hydroponic soil-less growing all done in coco coir.The combination of the greenhouse plan, the coco and the clear plastic walls allows this hydrofarm to grow as much as 6x more than the same space planted in the ground. The amount of work is also considerably less thanks to automated drip irrigation and fertilization. It's the perfect vegetable garden solution for city farmers and can be installed in a garden, backyard, parking lot and roof tops. \n\nThe Urban Food Farms greenhouse kits are available in a 8x8, 8x12, 8x16 and 8x20. Multiple 8x20 hydrofarms can be installed with 3 feet separation.  \n\nThis sustainable vegetable system works for many private and commercial city agriculture projects like backyard vegetable gardens, community gardens, restaurants, hotels and small urban growers.", "title": "Sustainable urban agriculture hydroponic vegetable greenhouse.dv", "publishedDate": "2011-01-03T19:19:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "38sRr0MdVus", "description": "Game Change: HBO'S Political Docudrama \n\nFew made-for-television movies have arrived with the amount of fanfare, anticipation and attendant hyperbole as has HBO's political docudrama Game Change, which chronicles Sarah Palin's erratic and polarizing performance as the Republican Party's vice-presidential nominee during the historic 2008 presidential election. Almost as soon as the HBO production of John Heilemann and Mark Halperin's blockbuster was announced, critics -- particularly those from the Republican right -- began taking potshots at it. That chatter has built up to a veritable crescendo in advance of Game Change's premiere Friday on HBO at 9 p.m. The film repeats tonight, Sunday, at 7 p.m.\n\nA good deal of the criticism -- including that from John, Cindy and Meghan McCain, and from Sarah Palin and her paid minions -- has been made by those who have not seen the film. Their pushback has been ferocious. \n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/geoffrey-dunn/game-change_b_1337017.html", "title": "Game Change: HBO'S Political Docudrama", "publishedDate": "2012-03-12T15:14:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "38sePV4sH_c", "description": "Arboreum with friends in Dallas", "title": "Arboreum", "publishedDate": "2006-10-08T03:16:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "38snc8QvS24", "description": "REQUEST, LIKE & SUBSCRIBE!\nAudio courtesy of Adam Madoun Productions\n\nChandelier -

They occur in few places on Earth. The highest concentration of geysers anywhere is in Yellowstone\u2019s Upper Geyser Basin (northwestern Wyoming, USA).\n\nImprobable Geyser is currently a perpetual spouter in the southern Geyser Hill Group.  It is located 14 meters southwest of Big Anemone Geyser.  Improbable Geyser erupts from a pool about 3 to 4 meters in diameter.  A continuous, irregularly-scalloped geyserite border decorated with small nodules encircles Improbable Geyser\u2019s pool on its northern, eastern, and southeastern sides.  Geyserite is a friable to solid chemical sedimentary rock composed of opal (hydrous silica, a.k.a. opaline silica: SiO2\u2022nH2O),  It forms by precipitation of hydrous silica from hot spring water. Geyserite is the dominant material at & around Yellowstone hot springs and geysers (the Mammoth Hot Springs area is a major exception to this). The silica in the geyserite is ultimately derived from leaching of subsurface, late Cenozoic-aged rhyolitic rocks by superheated groundwater. Rhyolite is an abundant rock at Yellowstone.\n\nThe southwestern side of Improbable Geyser\u2019s pool lacks a border and has irregularly-distributed, small mounds of geyserite.  This borderless portion of the feature represents the start of its overflow channel.  Eruption runoff drains to the southwest and west into the Firehole River.\n\nImprobable Geyser currently engages in low to moderately low perpetual spouting behavior from a vent in the northwestern part of the pool.  This feature first had eruptions in fall 2005.  Slightly violent vent enlargement events resulted in geyserite debris occurring around the geyser.  A runoff channel from the geyser to the Firehole River first developed at this time.  Reported activity of Improbable Geyser during October and November 2005 involved eruption columns up to an estimated 20 feet high.\n\nClips 1 & 2 - Improbable Geyser on 3 June 2014.\nClips 3-5 - Improbable Geyser on 8 July 2014.\n------------------\nFor photos of Yellowstone's geyser & hot springs, see:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/jsjgeology/collections/72157632147456746/", "title": "Improbable Geyser (HD)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T01:45:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "391hGKc8NK0", "description": "Yn dod i Pontio / Coming to Pontio - 01/11/2014\nTocynnau / Tickets: www.pontio.co.uk\n\u00a9 Gravity & Levity 2014\n\nCyflwynir portread pwerus o effeithiau rhyfel ar fywydau dynion a merched cyffredin o ffosydd y Rhyfel Byd 1af i strydoedd Afghanistan, a hynny drwy goreograffi crefftus a phrydferth - ar y llwyfan ac yn yr awyr - wedi'i gyfuno \u00e2 ffilm, barddoniaeth, cerddoriaeth a sylwebaeth newyddion.\n\nFrom the trenches of World War 1 to the streets of present-day Afghanistan, the impact of war on the lives of ordinary men and women is powerfully told through beautifully crafted choreography \u2013 both on the stage and in the air \u2013 fused with film, poetry, music and news commentary.", "title": "Gravity & Levity yn cyflwyno / presents Rites of War", "publishedDate": "2014-08-26T15:23:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "391kyXho7os", "description": "Shadow of the Colossus OST\n\nTrack 19.\nShinobiyoru Kage - Kyozo to no Tatakai / \nCreeping Shadow - Battle Theme\n\n-Koh Ohtani", "title": "Shadow of the Colossus (19) Creeping Shadow - Battle Theme -", "publishedDate": "2009-03-24T17:50:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "391r9jOmZcM", "description": "Will Sasso Vine Lemon Compilation\nWill Sasso Vine Lemon Compilation\nWill Sasso Vine Lemon Compilation\nWill Sasso Vine Lemon Compilation", "title": "The Will Sasso Lemon Vine Compilation", "publishedDate": "2013-07-23T23:59:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "392L8IWhMyw", "description": "A Falcon Punch match played on Port Town by myself (MageofBlood391 on GameFAQs), Steve (Killer_Spatula), Fooby (FoobyKamikaze), and Fooby's brother, Jonas.\n\nEnjoy the epic manliness.", "title": "No Items.

Apart from being the victim of Schieffer's accusations that the Tea Party senator was to blame for the shutdown, it also appears that Mr. Cruz was the victim of editing by CBS.\n\nBased on video from Senator Cruz's YouTube page and what aired on today's Face the Nation broadcast, the senator's comments surrounding President Obama's \"abuse of power\" were edited from the program. Instead what aired was a segment that ignored many of the senator's complaints directed at President Obama.\n\nIn the video that aired on CBS, the interview between Schieffer and Cruz ended with the following back and forth:\n\n    BOB SCHIEFFER: Will you run for president?\n\n    SEN. TED CRUZ: Well, look, my focus is on the challenges facing this country right now (UNINTEL) senate. My focus, for example, is on the abuse of power from the president. Let's take something like the IRS scandal--\n\n    BOB SCHIEFFER: So, I'll take that as a yes or a no.\n\n    SEN. TED CRUZ: Eight months ago--\n\n    BOB SCHIEFFER: Or still thinking about it.\n\n    SEN. TED CRUZ: Well, what you can take that as, is that my focus is standing and fighting right now in the senate to bring back jobs and economic growth. Economic growth is my number one priority...\n\n    BOB SCHIEFFER: Thank you, so much, for joining us and we'll talk to you again.\n\nHowever, as Senator Cruz's YouTube channel showed, the Texas senator had extensive commentary on President Obama that mysteriously did not make it to air, just two days before the president's State of the Union address:\n\n    SCHIEFFER: \"Will you run for President?\"\n\n    CRUZ: \"My focus is on the abuse of power of this President. Let's take something like the IRS scandal-\"\n\n    SCHIEFFER: \"Do I take that as a yes or a no?\"\n\n    CRUZ: \"What you can take is that my focus is standing and fighting right now in the Senate to bring back jobs and economic growth. Let me tell you something that is deeply concerning\u2014the abuse of power from this Administration. We've seen multiple filmmakers prosecuted and the government's gone after them. Whether it's the poor fellow that did the film that the President blamed Benghazi and the terrorist attacks on, turns out that wasn't the reason for the attack but the Administration went and put that poor fellow in jail on unrelated charges.

Thank you for joining us and we'll talk to you again.\"\n\nNow it is certainly plausible that CBS edited out the ending of the Cruz interview for time, however given that Cruz's comments were extremely critical of the president and came just two days before an embattled President Obama gives his State of the Union speech, the timing of such editing is highly inappropriate and unusual.\n\nCBS should explain why it felt it appropriate to edit out a high profile senator accusing the President of the United States of targeting his politcal enemies. These are strong accusations leveled at the president, and CBS's viewers deserve to hear them, yet strangely they were not.\n\n'Face the Nation' Edits Out Senator Cruz Condemning Obama's 'Abuse of Power'\n\nRead more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/jeffrey-meyer/2014/01/26/face-nation-edits-out-senator-cruz-condemning-obama-s-abuse-power#ixzz2rfx4NYiS\n\nhttp://youtu.be/399uXpEoATA", "title": "CBS Censoring Ted Cruz On Obama's Abuse Of Power", "publishedDate": "2014-01-28T07:26:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "39A53Rs3AxE", "description": "Bishop Nehru - Languages \n\nDirected by.

These lizards are mainly herbivorous are live in numbers in some areas. These lizards are found in loose clusters and attract raptors and predators. The Spiny-tailed lizard has a rounded head with a flat snout. It is usually yellowish brown, sandy or olive in colour. It has distinctive tail whorls of spiny scales with large spines on the side which give the lizard its name. They are limbed lizards with broad heads and stout bodies, and most adults grow up to about 25 to 30 cm (10 to 12 inches) in length. Their stout tail is armed with numerous protective spines that discourage most predators. Some spiny-tailed lizards defend themselves by partly entering their burrows and then violently lashing their exposed tails from side to side at their enemies. All species lay eggs and are predominately herbivorous as adults.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

It slowly dies a dramatic death of Lettristic convulsions.\n\n\nSPECTACLE\n\nIn societies where modern conditions of production prevail, life is presented as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived is now merely represented in the distance.\n\nThe spectacle is not a collection of images; it is a social relation between people that is mediated by images. The spectacle is capital accumulated to the point that it becomes images.\n\nThe spectacle cannot be understood as a mere visual deception produced by mass-media technologies. It is a worldview that has actually been materialized.\n\nUnderstood in its totality, the spectacle is both the result and the goal of the dominant mode of production. It is not a mere decoration added to the real world. It is the very heart of this real society's unreality. In all its particular manifestations - news, propaganda, advertising, entertainment - the spectacle represents the dominant model of life. It is the omnipresent affirmation of the choices that have already been made in the sphere of production and in the consumption implied by that production. In both form and content the spectacle serves as a total justification of the conditions and goals of the existing system. The spectacle also represents the constant presence of this justification since it monopolizes the majority of the time spent outside the production process.\n\nThe spectacle is both the meaning and the agenda of our particular socio-economic formation. It is the historical moment in which we are caught.\n\nThe spectacle presents itself as a vast inaccessible reality that can never be questioned. Its sole message is: \"What appears is good, what is good appears.\" The passive acceptance it demands is already effectively imposed by its monopoly of appearances, its manner of appearing without allowing any reply.\n\nThe first stage of the economy's domination of social life brought about an evident degradation of being into having - human fulfillment was no longer equated with what one was, but with what one possessed. The present stage, in which social life has become completely dominated by the accumulated productions of the economy, is bringing about a general shift from having to appearing - all \"having\" must now derive its immediate prestige and its ultimate purpose from appearances. \n\n\nPOETRY\n\nThe problem of language is at the heart of all the struggles between the forces striving to abolish the present alienation and those striving to maintain it. It is inseparable from the very terrain of those struggles. We live within language as within polluted air. Despite what humorists think, words do not play. Words work - on behalf of the dominant organization of life. Yet they are not completely automated: unfortunately for the theoreticians of information, words are not in themselves \"informationist\"; they contain forces that can upset the most careful calculations. Words coexist with power in a relation analogous to that which proletarians have with power. Employed by it almost full time, exploited for every sense and nonsense that can be squeezed out of them, they still remain in some sense fundamentally alien to it. \n\nUnder the control of power, language always designates something other than authentic experience. It is precisely for this reason that a total contestation is possible. The organization of language has fallen into such confusion that the communication imposed by power is exposing itself as an imposture and a dupery. An embryonic cybernetic power is vainly trying to put language under the control of the machines it controls, in such a way that information would henceforth be the only possible communication. Even on this terrain resistances are being manifested; electronic music could be seen as an attempt (obviously limited and ambiguous) to reverse the domination by detourning machines to the benefit of language. But there is a much more general and radical opposition that is denouncing all unilateral \"communication,\" in the old form of art as well as in the modern form of informationism. It calls for a communication that undermines all separate power. Real communication dissolves the state. \n\nPower lives off stolen goods. It creates nothing, it coopts. If it determined the meaning of words, there would be no poetry but only useful \"information.\" Opposition would be unable to express itself in language; any refusal would be nonverbal, purely lettristic. What is poetry if not the revolutionary moment of language, inseparable as such from the revolutionary moments of history and from the history of personal life?", "title": "Poetry of the Spectacle", "publishedDate": "2006-09-19T18:10:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "39D8il9EPP4", "description": "", "title": "Great Statistician Anandji Dossa Passes Away 23 09 14", "publishedDate": "2014-09-23T15:58:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "39DD2Au5-7M", "description": "Malaysia--Philippines relations refers to foreign relations between Malaysia and the Philippines.\n\nPhilippines has an embassy in Kuala Lumpur, and Malaysia has an embassy in Manila.

Association (ICA) addressed to you. We hope that you listen attentively to it, and that you are swayed by the importance and urgency of its purport. \n\nOur most salient national identifier is the Circassian language, which has survived millennia of history, full of strife and endless woe. Our greatest and most obvious challenge today, which is perceived by almost all Circassians, is the loss of the extraordinary Circassian language, the record of the nation's anxieties and flair, and its precipitous sliding into extinction and oblivion.\n\nWe appeal to all of you: Let us safeguard our beautiful Circassian language, for the sake of our ancestors, whose bones are still intact in our bodies, for the sake of the Fatherland, and for the sake of the future generations. Let us as a nation not allow our native tongue to be torn out of our mouth. Let us make a stand and be counted. Let us be proud of our ancient and grand language. The first language institution is the Circassian home; so speak Circassian to your progeny to preserve the national language, and let us, Circassians everywhere, speak in our native tongue. \n\nThe appeal was made by the International Circassian Association on 14 March 2006. The voice is by Boris Qaghirmes.\n\nBoris Qaghirmes is a contemporary Kabardian writer best known for his short tales. He was one of the standard-bearers of the movement to internationalize Circassian literature and culture.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "My New Models Car Obama New 2015 New Car Model  Chevrolet Spark  2015 New Car Model  New York Auto S", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T18:03:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "39NDONv3MQY", "description": "Simple penetration and expansion test of the Speer Gold Dot .40 S&W 180 grain hollowpoint, using a diluted form of SIM-TEST Ballistic Testing Media.

Visit http://www.leaffilter.com today to learn more. \n\nLet's look at how the two systems are similar.\n\nBoth LeafFilter\u2122 and Gutterglove\u00ae utilize an ultra-thin, micro mesh screen that allows water to enter your gutters while leaves and debris are diverted off of your roof. \n\nBoth systems are a completely sealed solution. Nothing but water will enter your gutters. No leaves, no shingle grit...not even a grain of sand will make it into your gutters.\n\nThere are, however, some key differences between the two systems. Let's explore.\n\nGutterglove\u00ae utilizes a metal aluminum frame while LeafFilter\u2122 uses a vinyl frame.\n\nLeafFilter\u2122 uses vinyl, or uPVC, as its base material. uPVC is used in a wide variety of home exterior and roofing products, including: siding; windows; weatherboarding; doors; soffits; and fascia trim.\n\nuPVC is sun, fade and temperature change resistant and will not corrode your gutters. Unlike aluminum uPVC is not conducive to freezing or ice damming\n\nThe most significant difference between LeafFilter\u2122 and Gutterglove\u00ae is in how the two products are installed. LeafFilter\u2122 installs over your existing gutters and does not compromise or disturb your roof.\n\nGutterglove's installation process includes lifting up the lower row of shingles and sliding the product underneath.\n\nWhy is this important? According to the warranties from the largest shingle manufacturers and roofing installers, any item that disturbs or impacts your roofing material may void your roof warranty. (Read more here: http://goo.gl/0XCrh) \n\nLeafFilter\u2122 installs on top of your existing gutters and does not contact, interfere or alter your roofing material in any way. Simply stated, LeafFilter\u2122 will never void your roof warranty. \n\nLeafFilter\u2122 holds the rights to the original mico mesh gutter protection patent. Every other micro mesh system has had to alter their product and installation process so as not to infringe on our patent. LeafFilter\u2122 is the first, and the best, micro mesh gutter protection system available. \n\nFor more information on LeafFilter\u2122 gutter protection please complete a contact form at http://www.leaffilter.com or call (800) 290-6106.\n\nLeafFilter\u2122 Manufacturer's Warranty: LeafFilter\u2122 is backed by a lifetime, transferrable warranty.

Every football player, whether a lineman or defensive back, requires good footwork and that is why we put a huge emphasis on agility ladder drills and mini hurdles.  These training tools increase your ability to develop fast twitch muscles.  \n\nLeg strength can be built over time through weight and sprint training. Cone drills can improve your leg strength and explosion with the load you put into a turn.  By sprinting full speed and having to suddenly stop, you put great force on your legs.  \n\nMini hurdles provide a great deal of leg cycle / turnover training.  You are forced to bring your heal up, around and down to sprint through the hurdles.  This training will increase your stride frequency and improve your foot contact.  \n\nThe OverSpeed bungee / cable adds resistance training to every drill you already do.  As you improve your technique, add the bungee / cable and see your results increase.\n\nSome brief training methodology:\n\nSPEED\nMechanics produce efficiency; efficiency produces speed. There is no answer for speed except more speed. Speed can be taught. It is not just a matter of running excessively or sprinting random distances; it is mechanics and techniques applied to specific training distances and suitable drills. With our high-speed training philosophy, we never train slowly. This is not the same as the Warm Up or letting an athlete slow down to learn a drill, like on the ladder. However, during speed training, all reps should be performed at a high speed. By training fast, you get fast.\n\nCHANGE OF DIRECTION\nChange of direction can be the most valuable tool coaches have at their disposal. Change of direction requires speed, strength and conditioning. It is the most stressful training event on the legs. It involves moving at a high rate of speed, followed by powerful muscle contractions in order to stop and make the change of direction, followed by the explosiveness required to return to a high rate of speed. This sequence over and over again results in the physically demanding nature of change of direction. We utilize it as a key element in conditioning. \n\nCONDITIONING\nConditioning is the product of duration and intensity of training. The more RPMs a heart can sustain for longer periods, the better the conditioning. Conditioning sessions are manipulated much like strength training variables -- a matter of anaerobic versus aerobic. In training, it is beneficial to expose the athlete to conditioning relative to their sport(s). Every sport has its \"shape.\" \"Football shape\" differs from \"soccer shape\" which differs from \"softball shape\" which differs from \"basketball shape.\" However, most athletic events occur over a period of hours and at varying speeds, so all athletes should have an appropriate balance of both anaerobic and aerobic conditioning. In our program, some conditioning days are anaerobic, creating a faster heart rate. Others are aerobic, which allows the body to absorb the training. \n \n\nFootball Positions that benefit from Speed & Agility Training:  \nQuarterback, Running Back, Wide Receiver, Tight End, Offensive Lineman, Defensive lineman, linebacker, corner back, free safety, strong safety (all defensive backs).  Even Kickers, Punters and long snappers.\n\nThese warm up drills will help prepare an athlete for athletic performance or training, but each athlete may need additional stretching to be fully warmed.  Consult your physician prior to this type of training to ensure you are healthy enough for physical activity.", "title": "DYNAMIC STRETCHING / WARM UP ROUTINE FOR SPEED TRAINING / EXERCISE", "publishedDate": "2013-04-01T12:51:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "39queDa8Avo", "description": "Sprawd\u017acie m\u00f3j przepis na Sos Beszamelowy. \nBeszamel cz\u0119sto dodawany jest do lasagne, kalafiora, szparag\u00f3w i nie tylko.\nJa do swojego sosu dodaj\u0119 cebul\u0119 z go\u017adzikami, \u017ceby uzyska\u0107 jeszcze bardziej wyra\u017any smak.

One of the boys, Raghava expresses his wish to join him. The rest of the boys too become Suri's helpers and eventually his henchman. The film continues 20 years later with Suri (Nagarjuna) and Raghava (Raghava Lawrence) and with the establishment of the fact that Suri is the Don with a golden heart. Then of course, he has Raghava as his sidekick, who adores him to death.Together, they rule the underworld of Andhra Pradesh. Since he is the unopposed kingpin, our don even has time for a song and dance on his birthday with his basti people.Everything is peaceful and hunky dory. But only till Feroz (Kelly Dorjee) enters the scene. Feroz is a feared don throughout India and he wants to add Andhra Pradesh to his underworld fiefdom. That\u2019s what sets off the battle of the dons. Suri begins to upset Feroz, because Suri refuses to work with Feroz. In many attempts to kill Suri, Feroz's men get killed. One man (Kota Srinivas Rao) wants to kill Raghava. Eventually, Don lets Raghava kill the man because the man also hosted a hideout for Feroz's men in Hyderabad.Meanwhile, Don falls in love with Priya (because of the three things he wants in his wife: to be kind, beautiful, and not to be afraid of him), at first she doesn't like him but later she also begins to like him. Raghava also finds a girl he likes. In that process, Raghava is cornered, where his fiance Nandhini, ends up being on the villains side.Raghava is killed. What happens to Don forms the rest of the crux.\n\nWatch more movies @\nhttp://www.youtube.com/volgavideo\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/newvolgavideo/videos?view=1", "title": "Anushka with Nagarjuna at his home", "publishedDate": "2012-11-16T12:44:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "3AE41amlrxI", "description": "", "title": "Senator Wendy Davis Melts Down Again In Debate", "publishedDate": "2014-10-01T02:09:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "3AEZVtEyZ0M", "description": "K\u00ebndon : Sami Kallmi \"Endrra e nates\"\nVideo : Stilo Production \u00a9 2014 \nPublikues : Almus Music (p) 2014\nNuk lejohet publikimi i materialit pa lejen e mbajt\u00ebsit t\u00eb t\u00eb drejtave t\u00eb autorit.\nT\u00eb drejtat e publikimit ekskluziv n\u00eb Youtube p\u00ebr k\u00ebt\u00eb version, i takojn\u00eb Almus Music.

This is called the primitive streak. \n\nAt this stage, the formation of the primitive streak defines the major body axes of the embryo, including the cranial end (towards the head) and caudal end (towards the tail) as well as the left and right sides of the embryo. \n\nAt the cranial end of the embryonic disc, the primitive streak expands to create a primitive node, which contains a circular depression, known as a primitive pit. The primitive pit is continuous with a groove, known as the primitive groove, which runs caudally along the midline of the primitive streak. \n\nOnce the primitive groove has formed, cells of the epiblast migrate inwards towards the streak, detach from the epiblast, and slip beneath into the interior of the embryonic disc. This process is known as invagination. \n\nThe first cells to invaginate through the primitive groove invade the hypoblast, and displace its cells. The hypoblast cells are eventually completely replaced by a new cell layer, which is referred to as the definitive endoderm.\n\nBy day 16, the majority of the hypoblast has been replaced. Some of the invaginated epiblast cells remain in the space between the epiblast and newly formed definitive endoderm. \n\nThese cells form a germ layer known as the mesoderm, which subsequently forms the notochord, the basis for the axial skeleton.\n\nOnce the formation of the definitive endoderm and mesoderm is complete, epiblast cells no longer migrate towards the primitive streak. \n\nAt this point, the remaining cells of the epiblast are referred to as the ectoderm, and form the third germ layer.\n\nThe ectoderm forms from the cranial to the caudal end of the embryo, such that by the end of the third week, the three primary germ layers complete the embryonic disc. \n\nThe gastrulation process is finally complete.", "title": "General Embryology - Detailed Animation On Gastrulation", "publishedDate": "2014-08-28T10:58:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "3APdez-Wv-A", "description": "Whats it to ya!!!\n\nMAIN CHANNEL\nhttp://www.youtube.com/tonytj7\n\n2ND CHANNEL\nhttp://www.youtube.com/tonytj72\n\nFACEBOOK PAGE\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tonytj7\n\nTWITTER\nhttp://www.twitter.com/tonytj7youtube\n\nT-SHIRTS!!!\nhttp://www.cafepress.com/tonytj7", "title": "Mr. Disagreeable", "publishedDate": "2010-03-13T21:38:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "3APzVkwJebM", "description": "Vanessa Upton and Sophie Howard", "title": "Vanessa Upton and Sophie Howard in lingerie", "publishedDate": "2014-02-06T08:31:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "3AQADCwSP_0", "description": "The Zoological Museum in Strasbourg was opened in 1898 on the terrain of the Kaiser Wilhelm University. The building was completely designed by Professor Goette and the architect Otto Warth. They took care strictly to fellow scientific and technical standards of those times. The entrance hall is decorated by oil-on-plaster panels, which were painted by Georg Hacker in 1894-1896.\nThe museum shows examples of the biodiversity of the animals, presenting high quality stuffed animals in beautiful landscape reconstructions as well as impressive models of insects. Due to the fact that biodiversity has to be interpreted as result of evolution, also a phylogenetic tree of the animals can be found to visualize important steps in the animal's evolution. Note: This film does not necessarily always present a correct phylogenetic order of animal groups, but fellows more the architecture of this exhibition.\nThe museum additionally makes a point about the history of natural science by presenting the early scientist Jean Hermann (1738-1800) in his impressive work room.\nAnatomical character transformations explain the important steps in the evolution of the vertebrates to become able to survive on shore. Visitors of the museum can marvel at an original specimen of Latimeria (coelacanth). The bizarre Long-wattled Umbrellabird (Cephalopterus penduliger) is visible at the end of the film.\n\nDas Zoologische Museum in Stra\u00dfburg wurde 1898 auf dem Gel\u00e4nde der Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t er\u00f6ffnet. Das gesamte Geb\u00e4ude wurde entworfen von Professor Goette und dem Architekt Otto Warth. Es wurde strikt darauf geachtet, damals g\u00e4ngige naturwissenschaftliche und technische Standards miteinander zu vereinen. Die Eingangshalle ist mit 8 \u00d6lgem\u00e4lden von Georg Hacker aus den Jahren 1894-1896 dekoriert.\nDas Museum thematisiert die Artenvielfalt (Biodiversit\u00e4t) der Tiere, indem nicht nur Tierpr\u00e4parate h\u00f6chster Qualit\u00e4t vor wunderbaren Landschaftsrekonstruktionen, sondern auch beeindruckende Insektenmodelle gezeigt werden.\nDie Biodiversit\u00e4t ist das Ergebnis der Evolution, und somit wird auch ein phylogenetischer Stammbaum pr\u00e4sentiert, der wichtige Schritte der Evolution der Tiere zu veranschaulichen soll. Zu beachten ist, dass dieser Film bei der Pr\u00e4sentation von Tierformen nicht immer unbedingt diesem Stammbaum folgt, sondern sich eher an der Architektur der Ausstellung orientiert.\nEin weiter inhaltlicher Schwerpunkt der Ausstellung widmet sich der Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften, in dem beispielsweise der Naturkundler und Mediziner Jean Hermann (1738-1800) in seinem beeindruckenden Arbeitszimmer gezeigt wird.\nAnatomische Merkmals-Transformationen erkl\u00e4ren wichtige Schritte in der Evolution der Wirbeltiere hin zum Landleben.

Doch ihr Verhalten ist es nicht, das unseren heutigen Begriff verdient.  Schon l\u00e4nger hatte die Sch\u00f6ne die geheime Leidenschaft zweier Hausg\u00e4ste ihre Mannes entfacht: Bei ihrem Anblick -- so umschreibt es das Alte Testament -- \u201egerieten ihre Gedanken auf Abwege, und ihre Augen gingen in die Irre\". So lauern die beiden Richter ihr eines Tages tats\u00e4chlich auf, vom Ehemann hatten sie sich an der Vordert\u00fcr verabschiedet.\n\nSusanna weist ihr unverbl\u00fcmtes Begehren zur\u00fcck. Von Rachegel\u00fcsten getrieben, klagen sie Susanna des Ehebruches an. Sie ist bereits zum Tode verurteilt, als der junge Prophet Daniel die Ankl\u00e4ger getrennt voneinander nach den n\u00e4heren Umst\u00e4nden der Tat befragt -- sie hatten sich nicht abgesprochen, waren von dieser Strategie \u00fcberrascht. Jedes durchschnittliche Gaunerpaar h\u00e4tte diese \u201egetrennte Zeugenbefragung\" eigentlich meistern m\u00fcssen. So kann man den beiden Alten wohl sp\u00e4testens an diesem Punkt der Geschichte eine gewisse Dummheit unterstellen.\nDas Ende vom Lied: Susanna wurde rehabilitiert, die beiden Alten get\u00f6tet.\n\nDas aus Sicht der katholischen Kirche zwingend auszunutzende erzieherische Potential der Erz\u00e4hlung l\u00e4sst Tintoretto souver\u00e4n in den Hintergrund treten. Delikat beleuchtet und in kontrastreiches Hell-Dunkel gebettet, breitet der Maler Susannas Sch\u00f6nheit im Bildvordergrund aus. In ihr Spiegelbild versunken, nimmt sie die beiden Eindringlinge noch nicht wahr -- ganz im Gegensatz zum Betrachter, der so selbst in die Position des Voyeurs gezwungen wird.\nVerzerrte Perspektiven, starke Lichtkontraste und der rasante Zug in die Tiefe des weitl\u00e4ufigen Gartens sind typische Kunstgriffe des Manierismus, zu dessen profiliertesten venezianischen Vertreter Tintoretto geworden war. Die sehr versteckt im Bild untergebrachte  Tiersymbolik schm\u00e4lert den sinnlichen Genuss auch nur wenig: Der Hirsch im Hintergrund links steht f\u00fcr die Wollust, die Enten erinnern an die eheliche Treue und die rechts \u00fcber dem Haupt Susannas platzierte Elster verweist auf die bevorstehende Verleumdung.", "title": "Jacopo Tintoretto- Susanna im Bade", "publishedDate": "2011-04-01T09:23:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ATa7gwjMOc", "description": "BF4: Phantom Trainee Phase 2 Passcode Confirmed!\n\nWatch the video for details!", "title": "BF4: Phantom Trainee Phase 2 Passcode", "publishedDate": "2014-04-06T11:56:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "3AU-_FuGfcA", "description": "Agents Of Rock's song Dudes Ain't Duds\nLive at the Latrobe Valley Hotel Morwell 08/08/14\nfollow us on\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/agentsofrock\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/AgentsOfRock\nReverbNation:\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/agentsofrock", "title": "Agents Of Rock - Dudes Ain't Duds", "publishedDate": "2014-08-11T04:15:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "3AU1BMQ1Ox8", "description": "PART 7 IS HERE!

The Cygnet enables Aston Martin to comply with the European Union--imposed fleet average emissions regulations taking effect in 2012.\n\nThe Cygnet was initially only sold in the UK. Production and sales commenced in January 2011 and the market coverage was expanded to cover other European countries the following year. Sales will not be restricted; however, it is expected that demand from existing Aston Martin owners for Cygnet would initially take priority. Aston CEO Ulrich Bez recently announced shipping expectations of about 4000 per year at a price of about \u00a330,000-- about three times as much as the iQ. Bez claims that the Cygnet demonstrates the company's \"commitment to innovation and integrity\", whilst respecting the need to \"satisfy demands of emissions and space\".\n\nAston Martin's changes to the design were to exterior tweaks and a reworked interior.\n\nThe Cygnet has a 97 bhp (72 kW; 98 PS) 1.3L inline-four engine, it produces 110 g of CO2/km and the fuel consumption is 58.9 mpg-US (3.99 L/100 km; 70.7 mpg-imp).\n\nIn September 2013, after just over two years of production, Aston Martin announced that it would stop production of their Cygnet city car. The Cygnet has been the second shortest running production car in the history of Aston Martin after the 2012 Aston Martin Virage, which was only produced for a year. It was cancelled due to disastrously low sales, with the car reaching only 150 units rather than its annual target of 4000.\n\nReview Testdrive", "title": "Driver: San Francisco - Aston Martin Cygnet (2011)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-09T01:25:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Al-aLN7cOY", "description": "Don't fall asleep with your swag on..", "title": "Peanut Butter Fish Nips", "publishedDate": "2011-08-02T02:42:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "3AlComJfKgo", "description": "Abertura do Festcine Amaz\u00f4nia 2009, desenho animado criado pelo N\u00facleo de Cinema e Anima\u00e7\u00e3o de Rond\u00f4nia- NUCAR \n\nAnimadores:\nErick Richards\nFernando Caetano\nFrancisco de Assis\nSaulo de Sousa\n\nDire\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nFernando Caetano (Fantashik )", "title": "MAPINGUARI", "publishedDate": "2009-11-29T20:28:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "3AlmCE-QWE0", "description": ".\n\nSterrenbeke - buiten wonen in de stad!\n\nWonen vlakbij de gezellige, bruisende binnenstad van Arnhem.

Please visit http://GeffnerProductions.com to find out how to become a featured on-camera expert in your very own series of \"Smart Tips\" videos.\n\nTranscript:\nDo you avoid beans or certain grains, because you're afraid you're going to feel bloated or gassy afterwards?  Well tune in for my smart tip today where I'm going to show you how to increase the digest-ability of grains and legumes, and at the same time, increase the nutrition content of those foods as well.  My smart tip today, to improve the digest-ability of your grains, your whole grains and legumes, is to actually soak them overnight before you cook them.  All whole grains, legumes, beans and seeds have a jacket around them called phytates.  It was nature's way of protecting these grains until the perfect condition, so they could sprout.  Unfortunately, what happens for us is that if we don't go ahead and reduce or pull that jacket off, we in fact don't access the amazing amount of minerals that are available in whole grains including: zinc, magnesium, iron, copper.  If you soak them long enough, they will eventually sprout.  And just in the process of soaking and sprouting you actually increase the enzyme content, which is what actually helps to digest those grains, and make it easier on your tummy.  So let me just show you a quick way on how to do it.  I've got Quinoa here.  And I've actually just added some filtered water to it.  Before I begin the sprouting process, I actually add a little bit of a starter that's going to help to wake up these grains.  So I either use a little bit of whey from yogurt.  So I'm going to just take a teaspoon of just the little bit of liquid that comes off of your yogurt at the top, you can just use that.  And if you're a dairy free person, you don't do dairy, another great one is just to use raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar.  Start with about a teaspoon for about a pint jar.  Then just put it into a warm place and just let it sit overnight.  Next morning, just go ahead and pour off that liquid, and now your grains are basically ready to cook. What you're going to find as another benefit, is that the cooking time is actually reduced almost in half.  So some of the more common whole grains, seeds and legumes that I recommend you sprout or soak before you cook them, would be like your whole Scottish oats, barley, if you ever use whole wheat, millet.  And then in the case of seeds, Quinoa like we showed today or any of your beans or legumes that you find in bean packages would be great.  Soak these overnight, your gut will love you for it!

The Cannabis plant has a history of medicinal use dating back thousands of years across many cultures.[1] Its usage in modern times is controversial, and in recent years the American Medical Association, the MMA, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, and other medical organizations have issued statements opposing its usage for medicinal purposes.[2][3][4]\n\nCannabis has been used to reduce nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy and people with AIDS, and to treat pain and muscle spasticity;[5] its use for other medical applications has been studied, but there is insufficient data for conclusions about safety and efficacy. Short-term use increases minor adverse effects, but does not appear to increase major adverse effects.[6] Long-term effects of cannabis are not clear,[6] and there are safety concerns including memory and cognition problems, risk for dependence and the risk of children taking it by accident.[5]\n\nMedical cannabis can be administered using a variety of methods, including vaporizing or smoking dried buds, eating extracts, taking capsules or using oral sprays. Synthetic cannabinoids are available as prescription drugs in some countries; examples include: dronabinol (available in the United States (US) and Canada) and nabilone (available in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom (UK), and the US). Recreational use of cannabis is illegal in most parts of the world, but the medical use of cannabis is legal in certain countries, including Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. In the US, federal law outlaws all cannabis use, while 20 states and the District of Columbia have decided they are no longer willing to prosecute individuals merely for the possession or sale of marijuana, as long as the individuals are in compliance with the state's marijuana sale regulations. However, an appeals court ruled in January 2014 that a 2007 Ninth Circuit ruling remains binding in relation to the ongoing illegality, in federal legislative terms, of Californian cannabis dispensaries, reaffirming the impact of the federal Controlled Substances Act.[7]", "title": "Cannabis is now the legal law in Florida ( news cut ) - Weed Fog", "publishedDate": "2014-05-09T03:18:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "3B4VuBdOoiA", "description": "Ez a gy\u00f6k\u00e9r egy laptopot lopott el egy pesti sz\u00f3rakoz\u00f3helyr\u0151l.

Problems include psychotic behavior, paranoia and hallucinations. The drug has been implicated in numerous suicides and homicides, including deaths in the U.S. military. For years the military has used the weekly pill to help prevent malaria among deployed troops.\n\nThe U.S. Army nearly dropped use of mefloquine entirely in 2009 because of the dangers, now only using it in limited circumstances, including sometimes in Afghanistan. The 2009 order from the Army said soldiers who have suffered a traumatic brain injury should not be given the drug.\n\nThe soldier accused of grisly Afghanistan murders on March 17 of men, women and children, Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, suffered a traumatic brain injury in Iraq in 2010 during his third combat tour. According to New York Times reporting, repeated combat tours also increase the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nBales' wife, Karilyn Bales, broke her silence in an interview Sunday with NBC's Matt Lauer, airing on Monday's Today show. \"It is unbelievable to me. I have no idea what happened, but he would not -- he loves children.

Erickson, Robert Evans\nScreenwriter: Roman Polanski, Robert Towne\nFilm Description: \"You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't,\" warns water baron Noah Cross (John Huston), when smooth cop-turned-private eye J.J. \"Jake\" Gittes (Jack Nicholson) starts nosing around Cross's water diversion scheme. That proves to be the ominous lesson of Chinatown, Roman Polanski's critically lauded 1974 revision of 1940s film noir detective movies. In 1930s Los Angeles, \"matrimonial work\" specialist Gittes is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to tail her husband, Water Department engineer Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling). Gittes photographs him in the company of a young blonde and figures the case is closed, only to discover that the real Mrs. Mulwray had nothing to do with hiring Gittes in the first place. When Hollis turns up dead, Gittes decides to investigate further, encountering a shady old-age home, corrupt bureaucrats, angry orange farmers, and a nostril-slicing thug (Polanski) along the way. By the time he confronts Cross, Evelyn's father and Mulwray's former business partner, Jake thinks he knows everything, but an even more sordid truth awaits him. When circumstances force Jake to return to his old beat in Chinatown, he realizes just how impotent he is against the wealthy, depraved Cross. \"Forget it, Jake,\" his old partner tells him. \"It's Chinatown.\" Reworking the somber underpinnings of detective noir along more pessimistic lines, Polanski and screenwriter Robert Towne convey a '70s-inflected critique of capitalist and bureaucratic malevolence in a carefully detailed period piece harkening back to the genre's roots in the 1930s and '40s. Gittes always has a smart comeback like Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, but the corruption Gittes finds is too deep for one man to stop. Other noir revisions, such as Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye (1973) and Arthur Penn's Night Moves (1975), also centered on the detective's inefficacy in an uncertain '70s world, but Chinatown's period sheen renders this dilemma at once contemporary and timeless, pointing to larger implications about the effects of corporate rapaciousness on individuals. Polanski and Towne clashed over Chinatown's ending; Polanski won the fight, but Towne won the Oscar for Best Screenplay. Chinatown was nominated for ten other Oscars, including Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes, and Score.\n\nchinatown,\"chinatown clip\",\"chinatown full movie\",\"chinatown destroyer\",\"chinatown part 1\",\"chinatown theme\",\"chinatown wild nothing\",\"chinatown soundtrack\",\"chinatown 1974\",\"jack nicholson\",\"john huston\",\"roman polanski\",\"bandage videos\",\"classic dramas\",\"classic thrillers\",\"20th century period pieces\",classics,\"crime dramas\",\"film noir\",mystery,\"period pieces\",\"co erickson\",\"robert evans\",\"trust videos\",\"jj gittes\",\"noah cross\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9362,/m/0c12h,/m/09fb5", "title": "Chinatown (3/9) Movie CLIP - Find the Girl (1974) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-10T23:03:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "3BBCAD8MSko", "description": "Visit http://ilectureonline.com for more math and science lectures!\n\nIn this video I will show you how to calculate the height gained by water in a tube due to capillary action.", "title": "Physics - Mechanics: Fluid Statics (6 of 12): Surface Tension: Capillary Action: Example 1 (Water)", "publishedDate": "2013-09-24T10:20:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "3BBISyV5umw", "description": "E vetmja Faqe zyrtare ne FACEBOOK:\nAlban Skenderaj: https://www.facebook.com/AlbanSkenderaj.official.Page\n\nShkarkoje ne iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/de/artist/alban-skenderaj/id286409424\n\nVideo eshte punuar nga Rudi Dolfi\nhttps://www.create.al", "title": "Alban Skenderaj - Refuzoj (Official Instrumental + Lyrics HD)", "publishedDate": "2013-06-18T09:09:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "3BBgfG_CD_A", "description": "Whitney Houston singing There's music in you [Live from Rosie O'Donnell Show, Feb. 8th, 1998]", "title": "Whitney Houston - There's Music In You", "publishedDate": "2008-02-28T17:16:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "3BBsLf-Vr4s", "description": "Server:    thefunpark.net\n\nGet Minecraft Cheaper here:https://www.g2a.com/r/miixed\n\nAnother one of our roller coasters, hope you enjoy.\n\nGive us some tips about upcomming roller coasters that you would like to see.\n\nSong: Vexare - The Clockmaker", "title": "Minecraft Roller Coaster - The Tornado (4Min) \u2605", "publishedDate": "2013-12-19T12:37:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "3BBtS1ir4tA", "description": "I upload a new video every THURSDAY and SUNDAY so please SUBSCRIBE! \n\nFor bookings please email mikeyjbustos@gmail.com\n\nThe Filipino accent is warm, high spirited, full of culture, unique, disarming, and is bound to make anyone smile.
