Merasa tak diakomodir, politisi Partai \nPersatuan Pembangunan (PPP) Hasrul Azwar mengamuk dan menjungkirbalikan meja.\n\n--------------------------------------------\ndakwatuna \u2013 Jakarta.  Sikap tidak terpuji kembali ditunjukkan oleh anggota dewan dalam Sidang Paripurna DPR. Sidang dengan agenda lanjutan penetapan komisi dan alat kelengkapan dewan (AKD) berujung ricuh.\nKetua Fraksi PPP kubu Romahurmuziy, Hasrul Azwar membanting meja sidang, akibatnya meja untuk Fraksi PPP dan Fraksi Hanura, terbalik. Hal itu membuat isi di atas meja tersebut hancur berantakan, diantaranya gelas dan microphone.\nKejadian ini merupakan buntut kisruh konflik internal PPP, tentang anggota fraksi. Hasrul kecewa, karena dalam struktur anggota fraksi, tidak ada nama dirinya.\nSempat terjadi hujan interupsi, dengan keanggotaan PPP, pimpinan rapat kembali menegaskan bahwa agenda rapat adalah pengesahan komisi dan alat kelengkapan dewan.\nPimpinan rapat Wakil Ketua DPR Fahri Hamzah mengatakan, ajuan nama versi SDA adalah sah. Sebab, hanya surat ini yang diterima Kesekjenan DPR.\nSelain itu, ada tandatangan Ketua Umum PPP Suryadharma Ali (SDA) yang ikut dibubuhkan dalam surat tersebut. Bila ada perubahan, Pimpinan DPR pun menunggunya hingga besok.\n\u201cKalau memang ada surat lagi (kubu Romi), kita tunggu sampai besok pagi,\u201d kata Fahri, Selasa (28/10/2014).\nNamun, hal itu tetap tidak menenangkan suasana sidang paripurna. Masalah konflik PPP kembali dibahas.\nPimpinan rapat lainnya Agus Hermanto, atas usul anggota rapat, meluruskan bahwa agenda sidang hari ini hanyalah membahas alat kelengkapan dewan dan komisi.\nAgus mempersilakan PDI Perjuangan, PKB, Hanura dan NasDem menyerahkan nama-nama anggota untuk ditempatkan di komisi-komisi. Tetapi tak ada satupun partai-partai tersebut yang mau menyerahkan nama.\n\u201cSidang kita tutup. Masih ada yang mau menyampaikan nama-nama anggota fraksinya? Kalau tidak ada kita tutup sidang ini,\u201d kata Agus sambil mengetok palu rapat.\nMerasa argumennya tidak terakomodir, Hasrul langsung mendorong mejanya dan membuat meja yang dia tempati terbalik. Tidak hanya itu, meja di sampingnya juga ikut terbalik. Aksi Hasrul pada penutupan rapat ini, membuat paripurna ricuh.\n========================================\n\nhasrul PPP banting meja,\nInsiden Banting Meja,\nSidang Paripurna DPR Ricuh,\n\nberita terkini,\npusat berita,\nberita terbaru,\nberita terbaru hari ini,\nliputan6,\nberita satu,\nberita Indonesia,\ndebat tv one,\nberita tv one,\nberita hari ini,\nberita jokowi\njokowi capres 2014\ndebat capres\nSidang Paripurna\nSidang DPR Ricuh\nFarid Hamz,\nParipurna Rapat PPP Ricuh,\nSuryadharma Ali,\nDPP PPP,\nSuryadharma meninggalkan rapat,\nSuryadharma keluar,\nSuryadharma Ali gebrak meja,\nBerita Politik\nberita pagi Indonesia\nsekilas info\nberita politik\nBerita Harian (Newspaper)\nberita sore\nkabar berita\nberita islam masa kini\nberita malam\nberita tv\nkilas berita\nberita jokowi jk\nNews (TV Genre)\nberita marsyanda buka hijab\nBerita Hari Ini\nJokowi 2014\nwakil gubernur\nBerita Terbaru Hari Ini\nBerita Jokowi\nBerita Terbaru\nStand Up Comedy 2014\nBerita terbaru hari ini\nberita ahok hari ini\nberita ahok terbaru\nPemprov DKI\nGubernur\nBerita Indonesia\nDKI 1\nBasuki Tjahaja Purnama (Politician)\nahok gubernur DKI 1\nberita ahok 2014\nBerita Terkini", "title": "Gebrak Meja Banting Meja ~ Sidang Paripurna DPR Kacau |28.10.2014|", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T18:38:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "9eViqbA_-2Y", "description": "Demonstration of 2 labs:  (1)  Students spin a plumb bob to determine its mass  (2)  Students calculate moment of inertia, torque, and work backwards to predict the time it takes a known mass to drop a given distance.

The five species are some of the largest nonhominoid members of the primate order; only the mandrill and the drill are larger. Previously, the closely related gelada (genus Theropithecus) and the two species (mandrill and drill) of genus Mandrillus were grouped in the same genus, and these Old World monkeys are still often referred to as baboons in everyday speech. They range in size and weight depending on species. The Guinea baboon is 50 cm (20 in) and weighs only 14 kg (30 lb) while the largest chacma baboon can be 120 cm (47 in) and weigh 40 kg (90 lb).\n\nHyrax\nA hyrax (from Greek \u1f55\u03c1\u03b1\u03be \"shrewmouse\") is any species of fairly small, thickset, herbivorous mammals in the order Hyracoidea.

New hair will not grow back in the previously waxed area for four to six weeks, although some people will start to see regrowth in only a week due to some of their hair being on a different growth cycle. Almost any area of the body can be waxed, including eyebrows, face, pubic area (called bikini waxing), legs, arms, back, abdomen and feet. There are many types of waxing suitable for removing unwanted hair.\n\nStrip waxing (soft wax) is accomplished by spreading a wax thinly over the skin. A cloth or paper strip is applied and pressed firmly, adhering the strip to the wax and the wax to the skin. The strip is then quickly ripped against the direction of hair growth, as parallel as possible to the skin to avoid trauma to the skin (i.e, bruising, broken capillaries, ingrown hairs caused by hair follicle trauma and lifting of skin).[1] This removes the wax along with the hair.\n\nStrip-less wax (as opposed to strip wax), also referred to as hard wax, is applied somewhat thickly and with no cloth or paper strips. The wax then hardens when it cools, thus allowing the easy removal by a therapist without the aid of cloths. This waxing method is very beneficial to people who have sensitive skin. Strip-less wax does not adhere to the skin as much as strip wax does, thus making it a good option for sensitive skin as finer hairs are more easily removed because the hard wax encapsulates the hair as it hardens. The strip-less waxing method can also be less painful.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Types of waxing\n2 Contraindications\n3 Benefits and drawbacks\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\nTypes of waxing[edit]\n\nMale chest before and after waxing.\nWaxing on sensitive body parts is best performed by an expert such as a licensed esthetician. Most parts of the body can be waxed, including nose and ear hair. Areas individuals should never wax include eyelashes and eyelids. These areas can be severely damaged if waxed.\n\nContraindications[edit]\nThe following factors are known to make those that are waxed more prone to \"skin lifting,\" where the top layer of skin is torn away during waxing treatment.\n\nTaking blood-thinning medications\nTaking drugs for autoimmune diseases, including lupus\nTaking prednisone or steroids\nPsoriasis, eczema, or other chronic skin diseases\nRecent sunburn\nRecent cosmetic or reconstructive surgery\nRecent laser skin treatment\nSevere varicose leg veins\nRosacea or very sensitive skin\nHistory of fever blisters or cold sores (waxing can cause a flare-up)\nUsing Tretinoin, Tazarotene, Adapalene, Azelex, or any other peeling agent.\nUsing hydroquinone\nRecent surgical peel, microdermabrasion or chemical peel using glycolic, alpha hydroxy, or salicylic acid, or other acid-based products.[2]\nBenefits and drawbacks[edit]\nThere are many benefits to waxing versus other forms of hair removal. It is an effective method to remove large amounts of hair at one time.[3] It is a long-lasting method. Hair in waxed areas will not grow back for two to eight weeks. When hair is shaved or removed by depilatory cream, the hair is removed at the surface rather than the root. Within a few days, the hair can be seen at the surface. With these methods, hair tends to grow back in a rough stubble. Areas that are repeatedly waxed over long periods of time often exhibit regrowth that is softer.\n\nThere are many drawbacks of waxing as well. Waxing can be painful when the strip is removed from the skin. Although the pain is not long-lasting, it can be intense, particularly in sensitive areas. Another drawback to waxing is the expense: waxing is usually performed by a licensed esthetician, and in some cases the cost can be high, depending on the area waxed and the number of sittings required. There are do-it-yourself waxing supplies, but they may be difficult to use on oneself on some areas on the body.", "title": "Bikini laser hair removal vaginal", "publishedDate": "2014-09-14T17:51:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "9egBbD_sRA8", "description": "30 Miler Test", "title": "Royal Marines Training: 30 Miler", "publishedDate": "2007-05-06T23:54:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "9egMByoEsLQ", "description": "", "title": "Scary peacock!", "publishedDate": "2013-05-20T15:54:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9egNkeXnpZg", "description": "August 17, 1959 --- Shortly before midnight, a major earthquake rocked Hebgen Lake, Montana, approximately 25 miles northwest of here.

Attorney Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) doesn't heed the Bible-based warnings of his mother (Judith Ivey), who views New York City as \"the dwelling place of demons.\" Instead, he leaves Gainesville, Florida, with his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) to put his legalistic skills to the test at a leading Manhattan law firm run by John Milton (Al Pacino). It all goes smoothly -- with Milton urging them to stay, putting Kevin on a $400-per-hour salary, and moving the couple into a luxurious apartment in his own building on Fifth Avenue -- where Mary Ann falls under the influence of neighbor Jackie (Tamara Tunie). After Kevin defends a weird animal sacrificer (Delroy Lindo, uncredited), he moves up to an important case with an apparent murderer, real-estate tycoon Alexander Cullen (Craig T. Nelson). Ignored by Kevin, the troubled Mary Ann has some disturbing experiences, verging on the occult, while Kevin, at work, becomes attracted to redhead Christabella (Connie Neilsen). Dazzled by his entrance into paradise, Kevin doesn't grasp who handed him this Big-Apple success. Could it be...Satan? The film features demonic creatures by Rick Baker. Cameos (Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Don King, others) add to the ambiance of ambition and power in the canyons of Manhattan.\n\n\"the devil's advocate\",\"the devil's advocate clip\",\"the devil's advocate part 1\",\"the devil's advocate trailer\",\"keanu reeves\",\"ruben santiago-hudson\",\"george wyner\",\"courtroom dramas\",\"psychological thrillers\",\"satanic stories\",suspense,thriller,\"arnon milchan\",\"barry bernardi\",\"erwin stoff\",\"michael tadross\",\"arnold kopelson\",\"taylor hackford\",\"anne kopelson\",\"steve white\",\"character videos\",\"justice videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++158823,/m/0479b,/m/026wcdv,/m/0k6m87", "title": "The Devil's Advocate (1/5) Movie CLIP - Jury Selection (1997) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-07-18T00:39:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "9enoYRKYCvs", "description": "Herodotus", "title": "Herodotus", "publishedDate": "2010-03-03T02:27:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "9eo8ursw0cI", "description": "", "title": "Ironclad Model Boats Cannonfire..", "publishedDate": "2010-01-11T17:32:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9eoKEH3ody8", "description": "", "title": "Kongo - Tre-Five", "publishedDate": "2014-07-02T21:15:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ep2D-KGyT8", "description": "Mr. Aguilar took the time to sit down and demonstrate the wonderful world of writing in flex.", "title": "Dallas Pen Show 2012:  Mauricio Aguilar demonstrating his penmanship", "publishedDate": "2012-10-07T20:35:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "9epmpRJuO5E", "description": "Episode 2 - Red Carpet Premiere!

Levine, Nan Morales, Michael Shamberg, Stacey Sher, Hilary Swank\nScreenwriter: Richard LaGravenese, Freedom Writers, Erin Gruwell\nFilm Description: Assigned the thankless task of teaching freshman English at a gang-infested Long Beach, CA high school, a 23-year-old teacher resorts to unconventional means of breaking through to her hardened students in director Richard LaGravenese's adaptation of Erin Gruwell's best-seller The Freedom Writer's Diaries: How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them. Her students had been written off, and her chances of succeeding scoffed at, but Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank) wasn't about to go down without a fight. Long Beach is a place where a new war is waged with each passing day, and when the hardened students who walk those dangerous hallways sense an outsider attempting to understand their plight, their cynical resentment threatens to keep a deadly cycle in motion. Despite the initially hostile reaction she receives in the classroom, Gruwell uses the writings of Anne Frank and Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Sarajevo to teach her students not only the basis of the English language, but compassion and tolerance as well. Later, when the time comes to tell their own tales in a project specially designed to explore the daily violence that the majority of students have grown numb to, the barriers that had once stood so strong gradually begin to crumble. When the only chance for survival is to befriend the person who was once your mortal enemy, the world is opened to a whole new realm of possibilities.\n\n\"freedom writers\",\"freedom writers clip\",\"freedom writers part 1\",\"freedom writers trailer\",\"april l hernandez\",\"jason finn\",mario,\"gabriel chavarria\",\"kristin herrera\",\"deance wyatt\",\"richard lagravenese\",\"diary videos\",drama,\"inspirational stories\",\"stacey sher\",\"danny devito\",\"michael shamberg\",\"nan morales\",\"daniel s levine\",\"hilary swank\",\"jordana glick-franzheim\",\"tracey durning\",\"caring videos\",\"hope videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++326847,/m/0mz73,/m/06byng,/m/027v9cq", "title": "Freedom Writers (4/9) Movie CLIP - I Am Home (2007) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T06:40:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9f8mNwiHxi4", "description": "My home bred ram, Sundey Nobleman, JMGN128.

Early on in the experiment, overly-aggressive foxes arose as kin of tame foxes. These foxes were isolated from the main breeding program, but Belyaev decided to conduct a study on aggression and started a second breeding program for aggressive foxes. This fox is genetically aggressive and has not been manhandled in any way throughout its life. \n\nThe stark contrast between the tame stock and the aggressive stock shows the influence of genetics on animal behavior. When isolated and bred selectively, behavioral and even physical traits become quite apparent.\n\nEdit 4.16.07: I just learned that Belyaev found out that the \"tameness trait\" was actually an adrenal response. Within 10 generations of selecting for tameness, foxes had much lower adrenaline levels than their wild counterparts. The neural formation pathway for adrenaline response is linked to a host of other traits, all of which he was now observing after those 10 generations: mottled or white fur color (melonin), droopy or small ears, shortened muzzles, shorter tails. Adrenaline was only one hormone in a collection of many that ended up being effected. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enrLSfxTqZ0\n\nOn today's exotic pet market, it is possible to find a red fox that is not red at all, but white. These are not arctic foxes but red foxes with white fur. Belyaev's findings suggest that these foxes have been bred through at least 10 generations of tameness selection. However, this does not mean that these foxes are tame on the same level that dogs are. Foxes make rambunctious pets which can be difficult to handle once they reach maturity. They tend to mark food sites and posessions with malodourous urine and they have a predisposition to dig and chew furniture. (Such foxes are different from the one you see in this video, which has had its genetics gone through at least 30 generations of tameness selection)", "title": "Belyaev Experiment: Aggressive Foxes", "publishedDate": "2007-01-27T03:31:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9fChCHY9TWs", "description": "There wasn't any studio version of this song on you tube.

This allows marketers interested in retailing to determine how to account for the development of retail trade overall and to know which channels are showing growth for which products in the coming years. It aims to capture the shift to new channels depending on the country, the effects of recession, and shifting consumer behavior; thereby providing timely, highly comparable analysis of the retail markets. Data sets are provided for 2007 through to 2017, with actuals being provided for 2012. All initial market sizing and analysis is conducted in local currency in order to ensure local trends are reflected in the data before conversion into other currencies.\nWhat is the current market landscape and what is changing?\nThe retail market in South Africa grew at a CAGR of 4.21% from 2007-12 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.46% from 2012-17.\nWhat are the key drivers behind recent market changes?\nConsumers have been reacting to the effects of the global recession and the following recovery period on their discretionary spending - retail markets have been no exception. While the country by country market changes have varied, nowhere has been left totally untouched. This report quantitatively examines the components of change in the market by looking at historic and future growth patterns - how changes in consumers behavior have affected the retail sector for different product categories and channels.\nWhat makes this report unique and essential to read?\nThis report provides detailed data on the size and development of retail sales of individual product types through specific retail channels and formats in South Africa.

The weight is the power of its position in the number. \n\n3a.- Different number systems have different number of symbols. Two for binary, eight for octal, ten for decimal\n\n3b.- Base 16 or hexadecimal has 16 different symbols, from 0 to 9 and from A to F.\n\n4.- The concept of weight can be applied to numbers in any other base. We can obtain the equivalent number in decimal base just by adding every digit multiplied by the base raised to the corresponding power.\n\n5.- For numbers less than the unit, we have to consider negative powers.\n\n6a.- To convert decimal numbers to hexadecimal ones, we are going to iterate divisions by 16.

They found that the day-old milk would curdle in the bag (stomach), yielding solid chunks (curds) and liquid (whey).  Once they discovered that the curd-chunks could be separated out and dried, they had discovered a means by which milk, an extremely perishable food, could be preserved for later use. The addition of salt was found to preserve these dried curds for long periods of time. \n    At some point, someone discovered that the most active portion of the young animal's stomach to cause curdling was the abomasum, the last of the four chambers of the stomach of a ruminant animal.  (In sequence, the four chambers are rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum.)  In particular, the abomasum from a suckling kid or calf was especially active.  The abomasum was cut it into strips, salted and dried.  A small piece would be added to milk in order to turn it into curds and whey.\n\nthere is a vegge olterive out there so dont lose heart", "title": "danger cheese", "publishedDate": "2009-03-13T00:55:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9fjuuW7GdP8", "description": "Python embossment has become a trend, it is beautiful and sexy.

So some people are just habitual bouncer. It's something that they commonly do. But as people tend to get more comfortable with each other, they'll slowly stop.\n\nSo one of the things that you'll see in an interaction is that for the first ten or 15 minutes, he might bounce his legs up and down. But as he becomes less anxious and as he becomes more comfortable with her, he's going to slow down. So what you're looking for is a deviation or a change in that behavior.\n\nIt's the same thing as in a presentation. Let's say that I was giving a presentation to these two. And all of a sudden one of them was bouncing their leg for the first 15 minutes. A goal of mine would be to get that bouncy leg behavior to stop. Because I know that once they're more engage or interested in what I have to say, it's less likely for them to commit those kind of behaviors.\n\nSo as we talk, you're talking back and forth. And then slowly, you'll see you're naturally a good communicator so you naturally orientating towards me. But you don't want it to be natural. If you we're disinterested in me you'd be pointing that way. Alright? You'll be faced that way. But as you get more and more interesting no matter what you do, no matter how hard your body just squares up with the person. So it's like \"Oh really? du dud dud\". So the example will be like you're talking and your here and it's like, \"Oh, no. I kind of did the same. Yeah\" And then slowly and slowly and slowly we're squared up. And that's the orientation we're looking for.\n\nSo if you walk up to a girl and the all of a sudden you're like \"Hi\". And she looks over at you and like \" Hi, du du dud,\" you want to see a gradual change in orientation. You don't want it to be. It's not going to be sudden unless you say something surprising. So if all of sudden if, \"So where you from?\" \"Texas.\" \"Oh my god we just,\" then you see that kind of thing. But usually you don't see that. You see slight deviation. It's the best when you get a sharp one then it's easy. And it goes both way. So if all of a sudden she's deviating this way and things are going good, when she starts to deviate back, things are going bad.\n\nA method for successfully guiding a conversation is to watch whether the person is oriented or disoriented. And what topics they orient and which topics the disorient towards.", "title": "How to Read Leg Movements | Body Language", "publishedDate": "2012-07-12T03:26:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9fk8lYmV8X8", "description": "", "title": "04  Visita Ft  Equis   Marmota MC   Hip Hop Ecuador", "publishedDate": "2012-02-02T10:39:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9fkKsbabKhc", "description": "At last - Lonnie Donegan and a different version of \"My Old Man's A Dustman\" taken from the Des O'Connor Show.

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN", "title": "Syracuse vs Clemson | 2014 ACC Football Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-10-26T03:18:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "9fpXIat4jh4", "description": "20 bilateral internal mammary artery graft angiogram distal lad pci through rima -radial approach  incathlab.com", "title": "20 bilateral internal mammary artery graft angiogram  - radial approach incathlab.com", "publishedDate": "2012-03-08T17:18:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9fpfT3V5itI", "description": "What is Blueberry?\nA report all about Blueberry for homework/assignment\n\nBlueberries are perennial flowering plants with indigo-colored berries from the section Cyanococcus within the genus Vaccinium (a genus that also includes cranberries and bilberries).

Steve Morse of the Boston Globe recently labeled the band \"an expansive,\npsychedelic-spiced rock unit with influences from Jim Morrison to Kate Bush,\" while the CMJ\nNew Music Report called them \"remarkable\" and \"enchantingly moody.\" Virtually Alternative wrote,\n\"like Sonic Youth, Mistle Thrush pushes the borders of indie guitar rock...combining the ethereal\nand the unforgiving.\"\n\nUpon releasing their first 7\" in 1994, Mistle Thrush developed a partnership with Washington, D.C.-based\nBedazzled Records. A string of releases followed, culminating in the acclaimed full-length\nSilt, which earned the band national attention including a full-page profile in Alternative Press.\nMistle Thrush then recorded their third album, Super Refraction, in New York City with producer\nKurt Ralske (Rasputina, Swell, Ultra Vivid Scene). After shopping the CD to labels and booking\nagents, years of self-promotion and self-management grabbed the attention of August Artists\nGroup, the company responsible for bringing Madonna into the public eye. After signing with\nCamille Barbone of August Artists, the band soon had a deal with independent label Egg Records.\nThe resulting alliance also earned Mistle Thrush a publishing deal with Warner Chappell Music.\n\nFollowing the release of Super Refraction, a year of relentless touring took its toll on the band,\nresulting in the departure of two original members followed by a split with their label. Still\ncommitted to promoting the album, however, a determined Mistle Thrush continued to tour with\nfriends filling in throughout 1999. During this time, the band shared the stage with such acts as\nSonic Youth, Garbage, Spiritualized, Luscious Jackson, Morphine, and Love and Rockets, to\nname a few. Super Refraction received national airplay and attention, charting on CMJ's Top 100,\nentering daily rotation on WBCN, and earning a \"pick hit\" in Friday Morning Quarterback, all of\nwhich contributed to increased exposure for the band. Mistle Thrush finished the year by\nperforming at Rolling Stone magazine's holiday party in New York City and were honored back\nhome at the Boston Music Awards with Best Indie Album and Best Female Vocalist.\n\nWith two new compilation tracks released in the Spring of 2001 (\"Heavy Set John\" on Arch Enemy's\nKnow Your Enemy and \"Drowning For William\" on the BDC's Maximum Wage), and two new tracks\non Chicago-based Invisible Records' ambitious compilation Notes From Thee Real Underground\n(October 2001), Mistle Thrush are back in full swing. Their fourth album, entitled Drunk With You,\nwas produced with Grammy-nominated engineer Andrew Schneider (Blue Man Group) and released\nnationally February 26, 2002 on Ecstatic Records. Initial reaction to the album has been\noverwhelmingly positive. WBCN has once again gotten behind the band and added the first\nsingle, \"Small\", to regular rotation. Along with commercial airplay, \"Small\" is also making its way\ninto area dance clubs, further proving Mistle Thrush's cross-over potential.\n\nNever one to be pigeon-holed, Drunk With You showcases Mistle Thrush's genre-straddling ability\nwith nods to 60's soul, 80's New Romanticism and bombastic nu beat. For those seeking refuge\nfrom a market dominated by regurgitated metal and fluffy teen stars, Mistle Thrush deliver\nboth substance and a solid kick in the ass.", "title": "Mistle Thrush", "publishedDate": "2011-01-27T04:29:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "9fvBYJzyGWI", "description": "BRISBANE BABA'S 7 DIWALI09\nPlease Watch my other Video's @ Sheeks99\nand here are some irrelevent words to reading if you like reading :) bonanza ,  hocus-pocus, hopefully, scuttlebutt, serendipity, fruition, caboose,  transmission, annihilate, glamour, reprise, regardless, maverick, commute, desiccate, surrogate, quibble,  fiduciary, patronize, illusive, acumen, loath, boggle, pervious, rhapsody, transpose, connotation, meander, Hunky-Dory, namby-pamby,  dishevel, aurora, buxom, vehement, fastidious, sedentary, sanguine, oxymoron, grub, humbug, sultry, vendetta, idealism, pragmatic, prerogative, jargon, karma, satire, acute, enigma, solace, discrete, vicarious, vernacular, effigy, onomatopoeia, kitsch,  forte, debacle, gazump, procrastinate, prolific, crotchet, wowser, rambunctious, sanctimonious, laissez-faire, chauffeur, mortify, oxymoron, prevalent, ghetto, cockamamie, ramshackle, heinous, gregarious, decimate, svelte, mantra, subliminal, plethora, anarchy, chicane, fossick, phish, canoodle, bodacious, prolific, nimrod, sanctimonious, epitome, fastidious, immanent, juggernaut,  idiosyncrasy, scuttlebutt, kitsch, vehement, inglorious,", "title": "BRISBANE BABA'S 7 DIWALI09", "publishedDate": "2009-10-20T12:18:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "9fvQnfTkCOM", "description": "SSCAR 1982-1", "title": "P\u0130ONEER DEX-P9", "publishedDate": "2012-01-09T08:29:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "9fvSx08RpzA", "description": "Heists", "title": "Crash", "publishedDate": "2012-02-24T21:55:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9fvkQ4Tw86c", "description": "", "title": "praktis s skull part 3", "publishedDate": "2012-07-31T13:23:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "9fvu951up_0", "description": "Like this video?

Hitler was a project of Zionism, and the Zionist bankers financed him. The same thing happened in Ukraine, but in the form of farce when the Zionists themselves proudly call themselves \"Judeo-Banderas\" (Zionist Neo-Nazi). Zionist Neo-Nazi are now preparing an attack on Moscow. In Sevastopol, I was with the School for Performance of Elena Kovylina. Elena Kovylina told me about the Festival Moscow-Berlin-Berlin-Moscow in 2004, where a Zionist Neo-Nazi Ekaterina Degot was a chief curator. At the reception after the opening of the Festival in Berlin, the head of the German side raised a toast \"For the Russian art!\" In response, a Zionist Neo-Nazi Ekateirna Degot stood up and said: \"Which Russian art!? There is no Russian art! There's only Jewish art!\" I appeal to the artistic intelligentsia of Russia and Moscow to resist the Zionist Neo-Nazism.", "title": "IRENE CAESAR APPEAL TO RUSSIAN INTELLIGENTSIA", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T00:21:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "9g8yK-E5x3E", "description": "Subscribe Now:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ehowatHomeChannel\n\nWatch More:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/ehowatHomeChannel\n\nUsing white toothpaste is a great way to remove water stains from wood and other types of surfaces.

So sorry about that guys, but I am so busy with school & atm I'm also sick, so, yeah.. that's that. \nThis season of TVD has been so good so far. I've loved every single episode up to date and it's getting better & better. Damon & Elena have slayed everything once again. The entire fandom (including me) was FREAKING OUT as they've kissed in the rain. Damn, it was so beautiful... Last nights episode was great, so I had to make a video, even though my Laptop probably didn't want me to since he/she/it did everything so that I couldn't get this video finished because everything crashed and was filled with glitches, ugh, horrible. But the video is finally here now, so! =) (With some tiny glitches and mistakes, but I really hope you won't notice..)\nI'm not proud of this video. I liked the idea of this video so much at the beginning but then I saw how it really looked like and it wasn't so much fun to edit anymore x.x I made the ending 3 times because I didn't know how to make it look better! Haha. However, sometimes there are better videos and sometimes there aren't, right? Next one is gonna be better for sure. :)\nI really hope that I will be the only one to not like this video and that you at least can enjoy it! :)\n\nhttp://youtu.be/BCHBMmMXAs4\n\nOhh & THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 13.000 SUBSCRIBERS!

Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.\"-- 2Co_12:9.\n\nTHE APOSTLE seems to have enjoyed wonderful revelations of God. Not once or twice, but often he beheld things that eye hath not seen, and heard words that ear cannot receive, and God felt it was necessary for him to have a make-weight lest he should be exalted beyond measure (2Co_12:7).\n\nWhat the thorn or stake in the flesh was it is impossible to say with certainty. He may have suffered from some distressing form of ophthalmia. We infer this from the eagerness of the Galatian converts to give him their eyes (Gal_4:13-17), and from his dependence on an amanuensis. His pain made him very conscious of weakness, and very sensitive of infirmity, and kept him near to the majority of those to whom he ministered, who did not live on the mountain heights, but in the valleys, where demons possess and worry the afflicted. Be willing that your visions of Paradise should be transient, and turn your back on the mountain summit, where the glory shines, as our Lord did, in order to minister to souls in anguish (2Co_12:4; Mat_17:14-18).\n\nOn three separate occasions the Apostle besought the Lord for deliverance from his infirmity, and finally received the assurance that though the thorn could not be removed, yet sufficient grace would be given to enable him to do his life-work, and he was more than content. On the one hand, there was the buffeting of this messenger of Satan; but on the other, there were the gains of meekness, humility, and of greater grace than would have been possible if he had not needed it so sorely--and he gladly accepted an infirmity for which there were such abundant compensations.\n\nDo not sit down baffled by your difficulties and infirmities, but run from them to claim Christ's abundant grace and strength, that at the end of life you may have done all that was set you to do, and more, because the greatness of your need made you lean more heavily on His infinite resources. \"He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might He increaseth strength.\"\n\nPRAYER\nHelp us, O Lord, to look on the bright side of things; not on the dark cloud, but on Thy rainbow of covenant mercy; not on the stormy waters, but on the face of Jesus; not on what Thou hast taken, or withheld, but on what Thou hast left. Enable us to realise Thine all-sufficiency.

We all have trouble accepting that bad things have happened, but until we accept it we really cannot fully process it. \n\nAnalyze the situation (including your contribution). The point that I am making is that a proper analysis of a difficult situation, or even catastrophic situation can lead you to the right  conclusion, which means don't panic, analyze. \n\nCalibrate your response in proportion to the adversity. If you have got a mouse, don't use an ak-47 try a mouse trap instead.\n\nRegulate your emotions and stabilize your physiology. If you are hungry eat, if you are angry settle your anger down, if you are lonely call a friend and if you are tired take a nap.\n_________________________________\nTo view the entire 9:42 second segment of Norman Rosenthal's 7 Keys of Adversity talk with Ray Dalio at Bridgewater Associates: http://youtu.be/6rGryS-xW-Q", "title": "Handling Adversity: Ray Dalio Introduces Dr. Norm at Bridgewater", "publishedDate": "2014-04-30T17:38:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9gOo_nBycRg", "description": "Droga Can\u00edbal | Sales De Ba\u00f1o\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jose.dod.7\nhttp://diosovnisdemonios.blogspot.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/diosovndemonios\n\nFUENTE: http://www.antena3.com/noticias/sociedad/joven-consume-droga-canibal-mallorca-requiere-diez-agentes-reducirle_2014070200317.html\n\nOtros casos: http://www.cronicabalear.es/2014/07/una-menor-sufre-extranos-sintomas-intenta-morder-los-sanitarios-la-atendia-en-punta-ballena/\n\nhttp://www.lr21.com.uy/mundo/1184806-mallorca-nueve-casos-de-droga-canibal-en-un-solo-dia-causan-pavor-en-las-playas\n\nA la gente le gustan las drogas, y si son nuevas aun mejor, eso nadie lo detendra.\nSe trata de un potente estimulante utilizado en los a\u00f1os 50 \u00bfque estra\u00f1o no?", "title": "Droga Can\u00edbal | Sales De Ba\u00f1o", "publishedDate": "2014-07-03T01:23:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "9gOqxH0qlwQ", "description": "FULL VIDEO  http://www.SimpleNursing.com   850+ Videos TOTAL\nOver 20,000 Nursing Students HELPED!!  \n92 Videos Pharm Videos http://www.simplenursing.com/850/pharmacology.php\n550 Videos Med Surg http://www.simplenursing.com/850.php\n21 Skills Videos  http://www.simplenursing.com/850/21skills.php\n- Fluid & Electrolytes\n- OB/Pedatrics\n- & sooooooo Much MORE!! \nStop Struggling.... \nSTART Sleeping Better & Dominating :)  Don't You Deserve it?\n\nhttp://www.SimpleNursing.com105 FREE Nursing Videos\nFree Drug Medication Cards\nFree Pharm Help\n\nhttp://www.SimpleNursing.com\n\n3  Goals that Simple Nursing is Founded On\n\n1.

The song became better known nationally in the 1930s when African-American churches held huge musical conventions. In the 1940s, a boom of recordings in many genera recorded the number, ranging from Southern gospel to jazz and brass bands.\n\nThe first known recording was by the Selah Jubilee Singers on October 8, 1941, (Decca Records 7872) New York City; with Thurman Ruth and John Ford lead vocal; Fred Baker, lead baritone; Monroe Clark, baritone; J. B. Nelson, bass vocal; and Fred Baker on guitar. Rosetta Tharpe also recorded the song on December 2, 1941 (Decca 8594), with Lucky Millinder and His Orchestra.\n \nThe revived interest in traditional New Orleans jazz resulted in multiple recordings of the number, including a 1945 session by Bunk Johnson's Brass Band featuring numbers Johnson had played in New Orleans before he left in 1915.\n \nIn 1950, it was a million-seller for Red Foley.\n \nIn 1958, an unreleased home recording was recorded by Elvis Presley made in Waco, Texas on May 27.Presley's studio version can be heard on Just A Closer Walk With Thee (2000) (Czech CD on Memory label). Tennessee Ernie Ford made the charts with it in the late 1950s. By the end of the 1970s, more than a hundred artists had recorded the song.\n\nKenna, a small ranching community in Roosevelt County, started in name in 1899 as a construction camp along the Pecos Valley and Northeastern Railroad. Before the arrival of the railroad, famed Texas cattleman George W. Littlefield claimed much of the land surrounding future Kenna as part of his cattle empire spreading across Texas and New Mexico Major Littlefield started the advance of the Texas-Anglo frontier across the Pecos River in 1882 when he purchased John Chisums Bosque Grande Ranch near Roswell. Later, following the advise of his principal ranch manager and half-nephew, J. Phelps, Littlefield, purchased water rights east of the Pecos between Fort Sumner and Roswell, permitting control of four over million acres of rangeland. This massive holding became the basis of his LFD Ranch. The drought of 1866 struck the overstocked range. Despite this setback Littlefield, who lived by the buy when people are selling philosophy of business, continued to expand his holdings, purchasing and consolidating ranches up and down the Pecos River.", "title": "Alma Bilberry Playing ~ Just a Closer Walk With Thee ~ Kenna-Elida New Mexico", "publishedDate": "2009-12-04T17:01:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "9gXE08kyWeM", "description": "", "title": "GLOVE REVIEW-RAWLINGS PRO PREFERRED", "publishedDate": "2013-05-12T21:52:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "9gXGE-hOECM", "description": "Www.headlightretrofits.org.uk", "title": "Fibre optic rod drl with indicator", "publishedDate": "2013-11-20T23:48:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "9gXGxi8Vs8k", "description": "Add my fanpage on facebook!

The foreclosure typically stays on your credit report for up to seven years from the date filed.\n\n\u2022 Initially, a foreclosure may cause your credit score to drop more than 200 points. The exact figure will vary based on your other aspects of your credit history. However, if you continue to pay your other accounts and debts in a timely fashion, you may not have to wait a full seven years to successfully apply for a new mortgage or installment loan.\n\n\u2022 There are many factors for the creditor to consider during the application process. Many mortgage companies won't approve a new mortgage for you for at least two years following a foreclosure but that is not a hard and fast rule. If you have a hefty down payment and a low debt-to-income ratio, you may be more likely to get an underwriter approval.\n\nSo what happens after seven years?\n\n\u2022 After 7 years, make sure to check your credit report.

I made it more slide-show styled, rather than an actual video given the deep, emotional and slow nature of the song. The whole song is comprised of 14 verses. This is a shortened version, which only includes the first 6.\n\nThis is the most important and well-known of all the Gunka songs. It's probably not an understatement to stay that every Japanese soldier, and perhaps every Japanese back at home, knew this song. Its the main Japanese soldier song, par excellence, of WW2.\nOriginally written in 1905, a product of the Russo-Japanese war, the song was revived during the period of war hysteria in the 1930s, amid the first pushes into China. It was sung throughout the war and experienced immense popularity among civilians and soldiers alike.\nTo me its a sort of soldier's lament, of tragedy and bravery on the battlefield, born of a war in which many Japanese soldiers laid down their lives (i.e. the Russo-Japanese War).\n \nTo understand the prevalent popular culture of the times, it might be instrumental for students of this period of history \uff08not to mention its fame which stretches on to this day in Japanese minds and collective memory and literature) to memorize at least the first verse:\n\n\"koko wa okuni o nanbyakuri\nhanarete touki manshuu no\nakai yuuhi ni terasarete\ntomo wa nozue no ishi no shita\"\n\n\uff2c\uff59\uff52\uff49\uff43\uff53\u3000\uff41\uff4e\uff44\u3000\uff2d\uff49\uff44\uff49\u3000\uff48\uff45\uff52\uff45\uff1a\nhttp://www.biwa.ne.jp/~kebuta/MIDI/MIDI-htm/Senyuu.htm\n\n\nThe book 'Japan's Total Empire' by Louise Young, gives these thoughts on the song and its context:\n\n''The boom of Russo-Japanese War theme products reconnected Manchuria to the victory that had startled the world and gilded the '(Manchurian) lifeline' with the reflected glory of the earlier campaign.\nAt the same time, the resurrection of elegiac Russo-Japanese War songs like 'Senyuu' called to mind the human cost of the war, shading images of the Manchurian lifeline with bitter memories of death and sacrifice\n.........\nEven before its resurgence in popularity during the Manchurian Incident, 'Senyuu' had made phrases like 'red setting sun' (akai yuuhi) and 'hundreds of leagues from home' (koko wa mikuni o nanbyakuri) common epithets for Manchuria. Revived in 1931, 'Senyuu' reminded Japanese of the importance of defending their foothold in Northeast China. Representing Manchuria as the site of loss, the place where fathers, brothers, and comrades in arms died in heroic sacrifice, the 'Senyuu' revival strengthened the sense of connection that the lifeline was coming to represent. Manchuria must be defended, for it was all that the Japanese had left of the loved ones they mourned,\nSuch personalized narratives of loss were linked, invariably, with sacrifice for the nation. In 'Senyuu' this was conveyed by the reference to the flag.''", "title": "\u8ecd\u6b4c\uff1a\u6226\u53cb (Comrade in Arms)", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01T04:31:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "9gb2ZXBCXLE", "description": "Save 10% on your WWE FIGS with Coupon Code \"GRIM\" order NOW: \nhttp://www.ringsidecollectibles.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?&DH\nOUR SECOND CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/user/kidlockdmh\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://grimstoyshow.com/\nORDER GRIMS TOY SHOW TSHIRTS HERE!! http://440416.spreadshirt.com/\nFOLLOW US ON TWITTER @GRIMSTOYSHOW @SILLYSUPERPOP\nFollow us on TOUT: @GRIMSTOYSHOW\nWe do NOT have a FACEBOOK or INSTAGRAM\n\nGrim's Toy Show joins Ebenezer Mittelsdorf and take you on a toy hunt shopping for and tutorial on how to stop WWE wrestling action figure scalpers inside a ToysRus TRU store shop action figures aisle but Ebenezer goes wild reporting about the shelf, throwing the brawlin buddies at customers, wrecking the store, screaming at employees, getting chased by big mad dudes, throwing stuff on the floor, and more!

It was inspired by Michelangelo's painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. In this stunning work, Michelangelo depicts scenes from Genesis, prophets, as well as the Sibyls of antiquity. The Sibyls were women that possessed the power of prophecy and were found i the oracles of the ancient world. The Libyan Sibyl resided at the oracle in Siwa. The Delphic Sibyl was found at the oracle in Delphi, in Greece. The Sibyls were symbols of wisdom, of sensitivity, and intuition. Deeply inspired by this, I decided to create another Sibyl, the Egyptian Sibyl, to convey a similar feeling of freedom, knowledge, and vision.\n\n\"The Egyptian Sibyl,\" as a sculpture, resembles a freestanding line drawing. By bending over 100 steel rods by hand, four assistants and I constructed the piece over a 3-month period in the spring of 2014. I am constantly amazed by the skies in Cairo. They are alternately blaring and soft, gentle and harsh, delicate blue and intense yellow. And I can't imagine a more wonderful canvas on which to draw. As the steel traces lines across the sky, the mood of the sculpture changes as the light does. When the sky is lit on fire with sunset yellows, oranges, and reds, the canvas for this vast drawing will be similarly vibrant.

IUCN lists it as near threatened,[2] while it is considered vulnerable by the Brazilian government (IBAMA). It is the only species in the genus Chrysocyon. It is locally known as aguar\u00e1 guaz\u00fa (meaning \"large fox\" in the Guarani language), lobo de crin, lobo de los esteros or lobo colorado, and as lobo-guar\u00e1 in Brazil. It is also called borochi in Bolivia.  The maned wolf has often been described as \"a red fox on stilts\" owing to its similar coloration and overall appearance, though it is much larger than a red fox and belongs to a different genus. The adult animal stands 67 to 107 cm (26 to 42 in) tall at the shoulder, averages 149 cm (59 in) in total length and weighs 20 to 34.09 kg (44 to 75.2 lb).[7][8][9] The maned wolf is the tallest of the wild canids. The long legs are probably an adaptation to the tall grasslands of its native habitat.[10] Fur of the maned wolf may be reddish brown to golden orange on the sides with long, black legs and a distinctive black mane. The coat is further marked with a whitish tuft at the tip of the tail and a white \"bib\" beneath the throat. The mane is erectile, and is typically used to enlarge the wolf's profile when threatened or when displaying aggression.\n\nThe maned wolf is also known for its distinctive odor, which has earned it the nickname \"skunk wolf.\"", "title": "MANED WOLF LICKING", "publishedDate": "2012-01-15T16:47:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ghsOY6gau8", "description": "The Australian Academy of Hypnosis.

He was posthumously dubbed Vlad the Impaler (Romanian: Vlad \u021aepe\u0219, ), and was a three-time Voivode of Wallachia, ruling mainly from 1456 to 1462, the period of the incipient Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. His father, Vlad II Dracul, was a member of the Order of the Dragon, which was founded to protect Christianity in Eastern Europe. Vlad III is revered as a folk hero in Romania as well as other parts of Europe for his protection of the Romanian population both south and north of the Danube. A significant number of Romanian and Bulgarian common folk and remaining boyars (nobles) moved north of the Danube to Wallachia, recognized his leadership and settled there following his raids on the Ottomans.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC-BY-3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler\n\nText to Speech powered by TTS-API.COM\n\nImages are Public Domain or CC-BY-3.0:\nVlad_Tepes_002.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler", "title": "All About - Vlad the Impaler", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T07:23:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9gj-UyMo_Mw", "description": "Women's Track & Field: https://tinyurl.com/TrackFieldGirls\nPretty Austrian Pole Vaulter", "title": "Pretty Austrian Pole Vaulter", "publishedDate": "2014-02-22T00:45:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "9gkK-9z6EWY", "description": "", "title": "Livia och Elmina \u00e5ker traktor med vagn", "publishedDate": "2011-04-17T18:54:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9gkcbG6yvNo", "description": "Sten is picking flowers in the forest and Leliana couldn't miss the opportunity to tease him about it.\n\nThis is a scene created using the Dragon Age Toolset and a video editor.

Over 2,000 rubber producing species are known, however, only two, Hevea brasiliensis (A. Juss.) Muell.-Arg. and guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray), have been exploited as commercial sources of natural rubber. Today, Hevea is essentially the sole source of natural rubber, nevertheless, active research and development programs are underway to domesticate and commercialize guayule. Guayule is envisioned as a new or alternative crop for arid and semiarid areas of the southwestern United States, north central Mexico, and regions with similar climates around the world (Thompson and Ray 1989).\n\nAlthough Hevea is the dominant rubber crop today, Hevea and guayule have had parallel histories of development. In both, commercialization began with the harvest of wild stands before the establishment of plantations and the initiation of cultural studies. Variability within stands and lowered yields per unit area were problems in both species. These problems continued through the early attempts at cultivation since the populations were very heterogeneous genetically due to their establishment from open-pollinated seed. Annual yields have been increased dramatically in both, from 400 to over 2,000 kg/ha for Hevea (Bonner 1991), and from 300 to 1,000 kg/ha for guayule (Estilai and Ray 1991). The differences in development between the two crops can be associated with the initiation of the Rubber Research Institute of Malaya, in 1925. The Rubber Research Institute has been responsible for over 60 years of continuous increases in Hevea yields and the production of a uniform and reliable industrial product (Bonner 1991). Guayule, on the other hand, has suffered from intermittent research efforts, which have in many cases been undermined by periods of neglect. Guayule researchers have found themselves more than once in the position of \"reinventing the wheel.\"\n\nGuayule is the dominant perennial xerophytic shrub found on the limestone bajadas and hillsides of the Chihuahuan desert of north central Mexico and the Big Bend region of Texas (West et al. 1991). Wild stands contain a natural polyploid series of diploids (2n = 2x = 36), triploids (2n = 3x = 54) and tetraploids (2n = 4x = 72); and under cultivation, individual plants have been identified with chromosome numbers up to octaploid (2n = 8x = 144). Diploids reproduce predominantly sexually, and polyploids reproduce by facultative apomixis. Guayule also has a sporophytic system of self-incompatibility and many plants contain B- or supernumerary chromosomes (Thompson and Ray 1989).", "title": "GUAYULE A SOURCE OF NATURAL RUBBER MODERN MARVELS RUBBER", "publishedDate": "2014-08-28T01:03:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "9gwx_gdZWQ8", "description": "News from the American Council on Science and Health", "title": "New study finds no health concerns in e-cig vapor", "publishedDate": "2013-08-12T19:42:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "9gx0G9kivfg", "description": "The Halle Orchestra visited Gorton Mount Primary School's nursery class to play music for them.

I absolutely fell in love with it and recognized a lot of what some of the men were singing about.  \n\nWhat saddens me most about music today is the lack of tribute back to Blues and Southern gospel that played a huge part in its creation, - particularly traditional Rock n' Roll.  If you listen to Eric Clapton or maybe some Bob Dylan, you can hear Mr. Hurt in their music.   \n\nI grew up in a home that was very comfortable. However, both my mother and father did not and both were born to very poor sharecropper families in Mississippi.  They both picked and chopped cotton in the Mississippi sun and both knew very well how hard life was at that time.  I can recall watching my mother cry about some of the things she had to endure, and my father always reminded me how that we have to strive to keep ahead and get an education but most of all keep our faith.  I think Mr. Hurt couldn't make those words any more plain than this song, \"Lonesome Valley\".\n\nJohn Smith Hurt was born not too far from where my father was born and grew up.

The game is about a group of \"terrorists\" who have traitors among them, out to kill everyone who's not a traitor.\n\nA small number of players is selected as Traitors, who have to kill all the Innocent players (ie. the rest of the players). Those innocents know they are in the majority, but they do not know who is Traitor and who is not.\n\nThe Traitors must use the element of surprise and their special equipment, if they are to succeed. The Innocent just have to survive, which means finding out who the Traitors are and killing them before they kill you. Of course everyone is holding a big gun, and everyone looks suspicious...\n\nFor the Innocent, knowledge is power: who is acting strangely? Who can be linked to evidence found on corpses? Who is still alive, even?\"\n\nEnjoy the video?

Chemotherapy drugs are heated to 107 degrees and put directly into the abdomen, which is then rocked to spread the drugs, said surgeon David Arrese.\n\nDuring the process, doctors cover the patient with a cooling blanket to keep the body temperature from overheating. When surgery is finished, the drug is removed.\n\n\"It allows the uniform distribution through all the abdominal cavity, to make sure every surface is covered by chemotherapy, and any cancer left behind will hopefully be killed,\" Arrese said.\n\nThe treatment is effective and helps patients avoid side effects like nausea, weakness and hair loss. Arrese said. \n\nMount Vernon resident Paul Arnold was diagnosed with abdominal cancer last November.\n\n\"We were told I had two weeks to live. Two weeks to two years,\" he said, then paused.  \"But the two years kind of got to me.  Am I going to make it to Thanksgiving?  Am I going to make it to Christmas?\"\n\nArrese provided the high school chemistry teacher with the formula to help save his life. He suggested an unusual treatment that is gaining favor with cancer surgeons across the country.  \n\n\"Once this is done, the assumption is that there is microscopic disease left behind, and this is where the chemo comes in,\" Arrese said. \"Increasing the temperature just by itself has been shown to kill cancer cells and not effect normal cells.\"\n\nAnd for Arnold, more years of life. \n\n\"You're looking at five year survivals of over 80 percent,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"I said wow, should we be out in the hall doing a happy dance right now?\" Arnold said.\n\nArrese said researchers are looking at the hot chemo bath as a possible way to treat some colon and stomach cancers, too.", "title": "Abdominal Cancer Treated at Riverside Methodist Hospital, Columbus, OH", "publishedDate": "2013-05-16T21:41:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "9h7H2N55UmE", "description": "Infinite in Azimuth doing the Ice Bucket Challenge to raise awareness for ALS.\nWe've donated, and you can donate as well here:\nhttp://www.alsa.org/donate\nAnd check out the band at:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/IIAband\nhttp://iiaband.bandcamp.com/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYihbDLsnk-pJo4Km14gPDg", "title": "Infinite In Azimuth ALS Ice Bucket Challenge", "publishedDate": "2014-08-22T23:15:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9h7OFbk58Do", "description": "Composed in 2013.

As described in Christine and Brett's wedding booklet, the traditions are as follows:\nSponsors-Filipino tradition calls for sponsors, referred to as Ninongs and Ninangs, to be chosen as a source of encouragement and guidance throughout the lives of the married couple. The is similar to godparents who are chosen to serve as a role model for the newly baptized individual.\n\nVeil-The veil symbolizes the uniting of two families. It is a garment that represents the mantle of love and protection that God bestows on the couple as they enter into the new phase of their life with God. The veil is placed upon the bride's head to signify that she is the heart of the family and upon the groom's shoulders to signify his responsibility to care for her and their family.\n\nCord-The cord symbolizes the infinity of the bond of marriage, a union that lasts a lifetime. The cord is placed around the bride and groom in the form of a figure eight (infinity) to remind the couple that life is a journey where the couple walk side-by-side, or the bond will be broken.\n\nCoins-(not shown in this trailer) The coins are a sign of prosperity and symbolize the bride and groom's dedication to each other's welfare and to that of their future family. Held together by the bride and groom, these coins symbolize the humble acceptance for the blessings that God bestows upon them.\n\nCeremony: Holy Family Church Chicago\nReception Venue: InterContinental Chicago O'Hare Hotel\nCoordination: Anticipation Events\nFloral/Room Design: M&M Special Events\nBridal Party Transportation: The Trolley Car Company\nPhoto Booth: ShutterBooth\nPhotographer: I Luv Photo\nChicago Wedding Cinematography: Delack Media Group\nMore info. on our blog post:\nhttp://delackmediagroup.com/blog/holy-family-church-chicago-wedding-video-intercontinental-ohare/1135/\n\nMusic license obtained", "title": "Beautiful Filipino Catholic Wedding in Chicago", "publishedDate": "2012-07-14T12:42:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "9hGycyMvuok", "description": "The Taxing Question of Land presents Rachel Rose Reid's The Circle: An Ode to LVT.\n\nThe land that we want to share the collectively created benefits from is now being passed between businesses to shareholders creating billions of unearned untaxed wealth.

A Big Bang Apologetic for the existence of God, that is. With fluid logic and wit, Chris explains why everything in the visible world points to an invisible creator. \nUsing the writings of St. Paul as his foundation, this Popular Youth Evangelist explains why it is reasonable to believe there is a God and that this God made, well, everything. Just as handiwork bespeaks a craftsman, a work of art -an artist, a novel--an author, so also the world shouts to us of the existence of God.       \n      In this illuminating reflection, Stefanick highlights the vital connection between what we SEE in the visible world and what it reveals to us about the world we can't SEE: the invisible, spiritual world. So, if the pesky gnats of atheism have been fluttering around your brain, let inspiring apologist Chris Stefanick bat them away with the fly swat of Eternal Wisdom.

It is the strongest, largest and thickest tendon in the body. It begins in the mid-leg and descends to the heel.\n  \nUnfortunately, the Achilles tendon is extremely susceptible to acute and chronic injury because of the demands it withstands.\n \nWhen it ruptures, patients feel a \"pop\" and may feel that they've been struck from behind. This is often followed by weakness and pain.\n\nYour Procedure:\n\nOn the day of your operation, you will be asked to put on a surgical gown.\n\nYou may receive a sedative by mouth and an intravenous line may be put in.\n\nYou will then be transferred to the operating table, where you'll be placed in a prone position, with your leg supported.\n\nIn the operating room, the anesthesiologist will begin to administer anesthesia - either general or regional.\n\nThe surgeon will then apply antiseptic solution to the skin around the area where the incisions will be made place a sterile drape around the operative site.\n\nAfter allowing a few minutes for the anesthetic to take effect an incision will be made in the long axis of the ankle over the injured tendon.\n\nThe incision is carried down through the skin, exposing the underlying tendon sheath.\n\nThe sheath is then opened to reveal the tendon itself and the contained damaged Achilles tendon.\n\nThe damaged portion of the tendon is then cut away, taking as little tissue as possible, but cutting back to strong, viable tendon fibers.\n\nThe surgeon weaves sutures through the tendon fibers in a pattern designed to hold with good strength.\n\nThen the two tendon ends are pulled into contact and tied securely.\n\nFinally, the incisions are closed with sutures.\n\nAfter sterile dressings are applied, a well-padded splint will be fitted.", "title": "Achilles Tendon Repair Surgery", "publishedDate": "2013-03-09T22:11:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9hVbF9UlyLI", "description": "", "title": "2013-07-13 Coq Rock - Mordacity (MOV05772)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-25T22:02:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "9hVyqvz-rBg", "description": "AD viral Seoul Secret collagen for men 15\u0e27\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e40\u0e21\u0e47\u0e14\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22!! \u0e2b\u0e25\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e22\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07", "title": "Model: Gabi Moon - Seoul Secret collagen for men Viral AD 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-03-18T09:38:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "9hVzqmrya0M", "description": "Hala Tree", "title": "Variegated Hawaiian Hala Tree", "publishedDate": "2013-12-01T00:22:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "9hW6_6y6MY4", "description": "\u041d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 http://za100le.ru/canning/appetizer-of-eggplant.html \u0412\u0430\u0441 \u0436\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043f\u0442\u0430", "title": "\u041e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043f\u0442", "publishedDate": "2012-10-09T17:08:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "9hXDC8vxvUc", "description": "Music & Lyrics: Tyler Crandall \n@tpaul5\nVideo Production: Joey Jetton & Steve Cakouros\nEdited by Joey Jetton\nhttp://www.joeyjetton.com/\nAudio Production: Andrew Kremer\nhttp://www.akaudiomedia.com/", "title": "The North County Song (Official Music Video)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-16T15:30:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "9hXHFwDfrFE", "description": "Indian band Undying Inc. performing their song Manimal live at Chromatic Waltz in Auxesis 2011, the annual techno-cultural-management fest of Dibrugarh University.", "title": "Undying Inc.- Manimal (LIVE), Auxesis 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-09-21T10:30:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "9hXgQZhil40", "description": "Daily Military News & Combat Footage at FUNKER530.com - http://vid.io/xGB\nM777 artillery rounds exploding on enemy positions in Afghanistan. \nEARLY VIDEO ACCESS HERE - http://www.facebook.com/FUNKER530\nUS artillery destroys a taliban foot patrol in Afghanistan.\n\nSUPPORT YOUR TROOPS! http://www.youtube.com/THANKASOLDIERNET\n\nEngaging a Taliban patrol spotted moving along the ridge line.\n\n*DISCLAIMER*\nThis footage is to be taken as a documentary on the events of the war in Afghanistan and should be viewed as educational.

Aleppo is a city divided into factions. Each group occupies a neighbourhood: rebel fighters, regime forces, Kurds, Islamists, foreign fighters, Sunni locals and so on.\n\nFighting in Aleppo governorate began on 10 February 2011. Over the next five months, major clashes left large parts of the rural countryside under rebel control, while the provincial capital, Aleppo city, remained firmly under government control. On 19 July, rebel forces stormed the city and the battle began.\n\nOn 21 September 2013, rebels seized control of several villages south of Aleppo in an offensive aimed at cutting the supply lines of Pro Assad forces from Damascus.\n\nOn 3 October 2013, Syria's army took back control of a strategic town Khanaser of Aleppo in the northern province of Aleppo on Thursday after a weeks-long battle pitting troops against rebels, a monitoring group said. Several days later, the supply line to Aleppo was reopened as army troops advanced in the villages around Khanaser. \n\nCommuting is back to normal on a strategic road in Syria that has just been retaken from militants fighting against the Syrian government.\n\nThe road links the central city of Hama with the flashpoint city of Aleppo in the north.\nIt hosted the first convoy of over 20 trucks carrying fuel supplies to Aleppo on Wednesday.\n\nThe route had been closed since August because of heavy fighting between the army and various militants.\n\nThe army took control of the road on Sunday night after engaging in a fierce battle with the militants.This came on the heels of several recent advances by the army against the militants in the north.\n\nSince mid 2012, the government forces have been fighting with the various militants to take control of Aleppo, Syria's largest city and the country's former commercial hub. \n\nAccording to opposition sources Hezbollah also is engaged in the battle of Aleppo, this comes despite the Israeli intelligence which claims that most Hezbollah fighters returned to Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli media say that some 1,500 members of Hezbollah resistance movement have left Syria. Israeli website Debkafile said in a report on Monday that 1,500 Hezbollah forces left Syria last month and 3,500 others are about to return to Lebanon.\n\nThe report also said the return of Lebanon's resistance movement's forces shows that the government of President Bashar al-Assad's power to fight militants has improved.", "title": "\u1d34\u1d30FSA Rebels Defending District From Advancing Syrian Army In Battle Of Aleppo", "publishedDate": "2013-10-10T12:16:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9hZkD8iYS2k", "description": "Descarga y escucha la canci\u00f3n en: www.soundcloud.com/entraildeposit\n\nDirecci\u00f3n y Producci\u00f3n: Hein Palma\nPrimer videoclip de Entrail Deposit \"First Impression\"\nCampeche, Cam. 24 Feb 2012\n\nfacebook.com/entraildeposit\nTwitter: @entrailDeposit", "title": "Entrail Deposit - First Impression (OFFICIAL VIDEO) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-02-24T07:34:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9h_ThA54NTw", "description": "Clica em \"gostei\" e se inscreve no canal para receber mais novidades.\n\nFACE -- www.facebook.com/vinny.barbosa25\nTWITTER / INSTAGRAM -- @_oMarcus", "title": "GAROTA SAFADA - EU T\u00d4 DE BOA [MAIO 2014]", "publishedDate": "2014-05-02T16:59:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "9h_ZUhUq5RI", "description": "Como fazer um Cone de papel para utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o na Cozinha: Decora\u00e7\u00e3o de pratos, funil, moldes de biscoito, ou usar como um mini saco de confeiteiro.\n\nPara mais detalhes desta e de outras receitas acesse:\n\nhttp://www.receitasevideos.com/2011/09/ola-todos-hoje-temos-um-post-bem-curto.html\n\nCurta nossa FanPage: http://www.facebook.com/receitasevideos\n\nSiga-nos no twitter: @receitasevideos", "title": "Como fazer Cone de Papel para decora\u00e7\u00e3o", "publishedDate": "2012-11-03T23:28:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "9h_ZrD7axi4", "description": "Audio available for download from SoundCloud: http://soundcloud.com/alexhp-1/supernova-sonata\n\nOriginal post: http://www.astro.uvic.ca/~alexhp/new/supernova_sonata.html\n(Site is back up!)\n\n\nFrom April, 2003 until August, 2006, the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope watched four parts of the sky as often as possible.

Even though such a small fraction of the sky was monitored, 241 Type Ia supernovae were seen during the period of observation. \n\nThis video is a compilation of the 241 Type Ia supernovae seen in these fields during the CFHT Legacy Survey. The four Deep Fields are shown in color, and the positions of all the supernova are illustrated as time progresses. The animation is rendered at 15 frames per second, and each frame corresponds to just under a single day (one second in the animation corresponds to roughly two weeks of real time). \n\nEach supernova is assigned a note to be played: \n\nVolume = Distance: The volume of the note is determined by the distance to the supernova, with more distant supernova being quieter and fainter. \n\nPitch = \"Stretch:\" The pitch of the note was determined by the supernova's \"stretch,\" a property of how the supernova brightens and fades. Higher stretch values played higher notes. The pitches were drawn from a Phrygian dominant scale. \n\nInstrument = Mass of Host Galaxy: The instrument the note was played on was determined by the properties of the galaxy which hosted each supernova. Supernovae hosted by massive galaxies are played with a stand-up bass, while supernovae hosted by less massive galaxies are played with a grand piano. \n\nNote that the brightness of the supernovae as shown in the animation are not to scale. Because they are so distant, even these extremely powerful explosions appear very faint upon reaching us here on Earth.\n\nSource of images: Stephen Gwyn's CFHTLS pages - http://www2.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/community/CFHTLS-SG/docs/cfhtls.html\n\nSource of SNe data: \n(Conley et al. 2011) http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1104.1443\n\n(Sulivan et al. 2011) http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1104.1444", "title": "Supernova Sonata - Music of the (Exploding) Spheres", "publishedDate": "2011-05-19T00:10:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9h_eLt9oz7M", "description": "vbvvbxbx", "title": "Bagasse", "publishedDate": "2007-12-10T18:56:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9h_okYjL_E4", "description": "Music video by Bow Wow performing You Can Get It All.

Stanley Hall and Arthur Allin described a \"tickle\" as two different types of phenomena.[3] One type is caused by very light movement across the skin. This type of tickle, called a knismesis, generally does not produce laughter and is sometimes accompanied by an itching sensation. Another type of tickle is the laughter-inducing \"heavy\" tickle, produced by repeatedly applying pressure to \"ticklish\" areas, and is known as gargalesis. Such sensations can be pleasurable or exciting, but are sometimes considered highly unpleasant, particularly in the case of relentless heavy tickling.\n\nThe question as to why a person could not tickle him/herself was raised by the Greek philosopher Aristotle.[4]\n\nFrancis Bacon and Charles Darwin belie", "title": "Ginormica hand held 1", "publishedDate": "2014-10-29T20:33:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "9hfJiqXvIJ0", "description": "", "title": "TENSOR \u9278\u93c8\u4ecb\u7d39", "publishedDate": "2012-04-30T06:16:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9hfrZs7EFQw", "description": "Download this clip from our video collection at:\nhttp://www.pond5.com/stock-footage/22403179?ref=motortion\nYou can find more similar stock footage clips here:\nhttp://www.pond5.com/video/1/clipbin:534380.html?ref=motortion\nSign up on Pond5 and get a special 10% discount on our footages!\nDetails: http://www.pond5.com/artist/motortion/?ref=motortion\nBrowse our stock media content on:\nhttp://bit.ly/ShutterStockPortfolio\nhttp://bit.ly/iFootages\nPlease subscribe to our channel if you are interested in free stock footage video promotions.\nThank you for watching video clip Female sportswoman works out elbow to knee fitness exercise for abs and obliques", "title": "Female sportswoman works out elbow to knee fitness exercise for abs and obliques.

Once she got home though, she decided she wanted some extra services rendered and forced him to enter her abode and then herself by using a 10cm long knife to get her point across.\n\nThey got freaky twice, but when Nicolae ran outta gas, Luminita was furious, and let it be known with a few jabs of the knife. Nicolae managed to escape the dominatrix by barricading himself in the john and called the cops.\n\nShe tried to blame the cabbie as the rapist in the trial, but the judge saw through the BS and gave her 5 years in jail. However that was reduced to a slap on the wrist in the appeals phase due to her having been on some serious meds at the time. \n\nMeanwhile Nicolae's manhood is under constant assault.

The question remains as to whether the bright spot seen moving away from the sun was simply debris, or whether a small nucleus of the original ball of ice was still there. Regardless, it is likely that it is now only dust.\nComet ISON, which began its journey from the Oort Cloud some 3 million years ago, made its closest approach to the sun on Nov. 28, 2013. The comet was visible in instruments on NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or STEREO, and the joint European Space Agency/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO, via images called coronagraphs. Coronagraphs block out the sun and a considerable distance around it, in order to better observe the dim structures in the sun's atmosphere, the corona. As such, there was a period of several hours when the comet was obscured in these images, blocked from view along with the sun. During this period of time, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory could not see the comet, leading many scientists to surmise that the comet had disintegrated completely. However, something did reappear in SOHO and STEREO coronagraphs some time later -- though it was significantly less bright.\nWhether that spot of light was merely a cloud of dust that once was a comet, or if it still had a nucleus -- a small ball of its original, icy material -- intact, is still unclear. It seems likely that as of Dec. 1, there was no nucleus left. By monitoring its changes in brightness over time, scientists can estimate whether there's a nucleus or not, but our best chance at knowing for sure will be if the Hubble Space Telescope makes observations later in December 2013.\nRegardless of its fate, Comet ISON did not disappoint researchers. Over the last year, observatories around the world and in space gathered one of the largest sets of comet observations of all time, which should provide fodder for study for years to come.

Science says \"Flares are intense brightenings that occur in the solar chromosphere. Flares are generally observed from Earth using narrow band filters, typically with a bandwidth of less than 0.1 nm, and often centred on the Hydrogen-Alpha wavelength of 656.3 nm. (Flares also have counterparts, that is, sudden outbursts, in the radio and X-ray spectrum).\n\nMost flares occur around active regions associated with sunspot groups. However, occasionally a flare (sudden brightening) is observed well away from an active region or sunspot group. These flares are invariably associated with the sudden disappearance of a large (thick, long, 'bushy') dark solar filament, and are termed Hyder flares.\n\nWhat produces Hyder flares?\n\nHyder's explanation of the flare type now named after him depended on the observational evidence that (1) often the flare was a parallel ribbon flare with one ribbon each side of the filament channel, and (2) that geomagnetic storms were not associated with these flares. This led to the speculation that the filamentary material was not ejected far into the corona, but in fact fell back to the chromosphere producing the flare.\"\n\nTHORnews says \"Holy shit that shit looks crazy. I told y'all the Sun was freaking out.\"\n\nWe're going to keep our eye on this.

Cicadas are in the superfamily Cicadoidea. Their eyes are prominent, though not especially large, and set wide apart on the anterior lateral corners of the frons. The wings are well-developed, with conspicuous veins; in some species the wing membranes are wholly transparent, whereas in many others the proximal parts of the wings are clouded or opaque and some have no significantly clear areas on their wings at all. About 2,500 species of cicada have been described, and many remain to be described. Cicadas live in temperate-to-tropical climates where they are among the most-widely recognized of all insects, mainly due to their large size and unique sound. Cicadas are often colloquially called locusts,[1] although they are unrelated to true locusts, which are various species of swarming grasshopper. Cicadas are related to leafhoppers and spittlebugs.\nCicadas are benign to humans under normal circumstances and do not bite or sting in a true sense, but may mistake a person's arm or other part of their body for a tree or plant limb and attempt to feed.[2] Cicadas have a long proboscis, under their head, which they insert into plant stems in order to feed on sap. It can be painful if they attempt to pierce a person's skin with it, but it is unlikely to cause other harm. It is unlikely to be a defensive reaction and is a rare occurrence. It usually only happens when they are allowed to rest on a person's body for an extended amount of time.\nCicadas can cause damage to several cultivated crops, shrubs, and trees, mainly in the form of scarring left on tree branches while the females lay their eggs deep in branches.[3][4][5]\nMany people around the world regularly eat cicadas. They are known to have been eaten in Ancient Greece as well as China, Malaysia, Burma, Latin America, and the Congo.[6] Female cicadas are prized for being meatier.[6] Shells of cicadas are employed in the traditional medicines of China.[7]\n\nCicadas are arranged into two families: Tettigarctidae (q.v.) and Cicadidae. There are two extant species of Tettigarctidae, one in southern Australia, and the other in Tasmania. The family Cicadidae is subdivided into the subfamilies Cicadinae, Tettigadinae, and Cicadettinae,[8] and they exist on all continents except Antarctica. Some previous works also included a family-level taxon called the Tibiceninae.\n\n\nA 17-year cicada, or Magicicada\nThe largest cicadas are in the genera Megapomponia, Pomponia and Tacua.\nThere are some 200 species in 38 genera in Australia, about 450 in Africa, about 100 in the Palaearctic, and only one species in England, the New Forest cicada, Melampsalta montana, widely distributed throughout Europe. There are about 150 species in South Africa.\n\nsharing what i seen today with you.\nif you have some time\nplease leave a comment below. \nand Please Subscribe to my channel \n \nand thank you very much for watching my videos..\n\npictures of Griffith IN  here \nhttp://christopherphoto.blogspot.com\n\nVisit Griffith Indiana's Nature on facebook \nhttp://www.facebook.com/GriffithIndianasNaturePhotos\n\njoin me on Google+ \nhttp://plus.google.com/112815794394767726853\n\nJoin me on Twitter\nhttp://twitter.com/griffithindiana", "title": "Cicada", "publishedDate": "2013-08-29T10:11:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "9iNALk2ClIk", "description": "Interview with Professor Sumimoto, explaining the benefits of the Nephron Filtration system at Ariake Port on 21 April 2010.", "title": "Nephron System - Oil Filtration", "publishedDate": "2010-04-23T06:07:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "9iNBbkLTXl4", "description": "My baby is sick", "title": "Nevamoa coughing", "publishedDate": "2012-09-08T23:41:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "9iNCRDYt3zI", "description": "Das Handling von Kornnattern ist ein umstrittenes Thema.Eine Gruppe von Schlangenhaltern vertritt die Meinung, dass Schlangen prinzipiell ins Terrarium geh\u00f6ren,\nau\u00dfer zur Kontrolle der Tiere und zum umsetzten.

It was very dangerous for the chaplain who was with me so they lowered the body of this seafarer on to the barge so that he could be given the sacraments of death.\n\nThe organization also helps on solid ground. They have a total of 418 centers in ports where  religious and secular people alike offer friendship and spiritual and material aid such as internet, libraries, and arcade games. \n\nXavier Pinto\nApostleship of the Sea\nThis is a great connection wherever I go with fishing communities and sailors. They look at this and say wow where did you go? I'm not going to tell them where I went but I can always tell why I went, having to bring the heart of God to them and some friendship into their loneliness.\n\nThe apostles of the sea hope this initiative encourages those who live near ports to help the seafarers that arrive, as well as the families of those who have set sail. .\n\n---------------------\n\nSuscr\u00edbete al canal: http://smarturl.it/RomeReports\nVisita nuestra web: http://www.romereports.com/\n\nROME REPORTS, www.romereports.com, is an independent international TV News Agency based in Rome covering the activity of the Pope, the life of the Vatican and current social, cultural and religious debates.

Unfortunately, 10% benzoyl peroxide is a little too high of concentration, and will cause negative side effects like dry, flaky, and/or red skin.\n\nCompared together, Equate's spot treatment is much better than Zapzyt, for the simple fact that the Equate treatment does NOT contain beads. (Why should their be beads in a spot treatment / benzoyl peroxide lotion treatment anyway?) \n\nAlthough Equate does work, much like Zapzyt, the 10% benzoyl peroxide is far too high of a concentration. Rather than using a product that contains 10% b.p. (benzoyl peroxide), you should always go for a product containing 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. \n\nMore about Benzoyl Peroxide coming soon...", "title": "Equate Spot Treatment Review with 10% Benzoyl Peroxide", "publishedDate": "2013-09-01T23:39:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "9iU1eSdyoso", "description": "CRAZY BALDHEAD COVER- COMITY ROOTS REGGAE", "title": "Comity Roots Reggae", "publishedDate": "2014-10-29T08:22:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "9iU3FlCmgwM", "description": "Concept and Script FOSE \nImage Luchian Ciobanu\nMontage Luchian and FOSE\nWardrobe Consultant EUGENIE\nSpecial thanks to Cosmin\nhttps://zichmannfose.wordpress.com/\nhttp://luchian.ro/\nhttp://portofoliueg.blogspot.ro/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm7nFCqPb4w\n\nMix/Master Benzen\n\nCollaborative Artists:\nRobert Acsintoaie - Bass\nAlexandru Nitu - Guitar\nAlex Kocsis - Drums\nGabriel Balasa - Percussions\n\nContact: tonybaboonband@gmail.com\nWebsite: https://www.facebook.com/TonyBaboon", "title": "Tony Baboon - Baobab Sawyer", "publishedDate": "2013-08-21T12:08:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "9iUaIG5mLgU", "description": "Paracentesis, azul y viscoelastico3", "title": "Paracentesis, azul y viscoelastico3", "publishedDate": "2008-08-15T13:40:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "9iUf33bMO5Q", "description": "Moving salt", "title": "Ojibway salt mine", "publishedDate": "2011-12-20T22:02:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "9iUu_SZNMCU", "description": "Students are prepared with the knowledge and skills necessary to function as a Central Service Technician.
