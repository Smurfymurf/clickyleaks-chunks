He's dedicated to his job, but hates small town politics.  Years ago, a wad of gum was jettisoned in space by Apollo 13, doused by cosmic energy, and has now landed in the outskirts of his city. \n \nThe town drunk swears it vaporized his dog and beef jerky.  As word gets around, curious townspeople, sci-fi buffs, cult members, and Chinese scientists begin disappearing.   Powerful Mayor Gong sees this as a money making tourist attraction and scoffs at the danger.\n \nThe Sheriff fights City Hall in vain to keep more people from disappearing.

The propulsion is induced by modification of the liquid surface using organic vapour transported through a nanocellulose aerogel membrane. The steady velocity is achieved through continuous supply of fuel vapour that lowers the surface tension of the liquid, combined with the spontaneous recovery of the surface tension after the floating machine has \ufffcpassed. The membranes are gas permeable from their open-porous water and oils due to their superhydrophobic and superoleophobic selecting solvents with different vapour pressures.\n\nThis video is part of the publication:\nVapour-Driven Marangoni Propulsion: Continuous, Prolonged and Tunable Motion\nHua Jin,  Abraham Marmur,  Olli Ikkala and Robin H.

Esto es m\u00e1s notable en las nalgas y los muslos, y lo m\u00e1s normal es que se produzca despu\u00e9s de la pubertad.\n\nLa celulitis es tambi\u00e9n conocida como adiposis edematosa, dermopanniculosis deformante, estado protrusus cutis, y la lipodistrofia ginoide en el campo de la medicina, y como piel de naranja, piel de reques\u00f3n y fen\u00f3meno de colch\u00f3n en el lenguaje coloquial.\n\nLa celulitis se clasifica a menudo en tres grados:\n\n\u2022Grado 1. La celulitis presenta s\u00edntomas cl\u00ednicos, pero un examen bajo microscopio de las c\u00e9lulas de la zona puede detectar cambios anat\u00f3micos subyacentes.\n\n\u2022Grado 2. La celulitis produce palidez en la piel, menor temperatura,\ny disminuci\u00f3n de la elasticidad, adem\u00e1s de los cambios anat\u00f3micos observados por ex\u00e1menes microsc\u00f3picos.\n\n\u2022Grado 3. La celulitis tiene rugosidad visible de la piel (como la piel de una naranja), junto con todos los signos del grado 2.\n\nAunque la celulitis puede afectar a ambos sexos, es mucho m\u00e1s com\u00fan en las mujeres, principalmente debido a que son m\u00e1s propensas a tener determinados tipos de grasa y tejido conectivo.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 causa la celulitis?\n\nLas causas de la celulitis a\u00fan no han sido identificadas, pero hay varias teor\u00edas que proponen diferentes formas de explicar su aparici\u00f3n. Entre ellas encontramos:\n\n\u2022Los factores hormonales\n\n- Las hormonas probablemente juegan un papel importante en el desarrollo de la celulitis. Muchos opinan que la insulina, el estr\u00f3geno, la noradrenalina, prolactina y hormonas tiroideas son parte del proceso de producci\u00f3n de la celulitis.\n\n\u2022gen\u00e9tica\n\n- Se requieren ciertos genes para el desarrollo de la celulitis. Los genes suelen predisponer a un individuo a las caracter\u00edsticas particulares asociadas a la celulitis, tales como: g\u00e9nero, raza, metabolismo lento, distribuci\u00f3n de grasa justo debajo de la piel e insuficiencia circulatoria.\n\n\u2022dieta\n\n- Las personas que comen demasiada grasa, carbohidratos o sal y muy poca fibra son propensos a tener una mayor cantidad de celulitis.\n\n\u2022El estilo de vida\n\n- La celulitis puede ser m\u00e1s frecuente en fumadores, los que no\nhacen ejercicios y los que se sientan en una posici\u00f3n durante largos per\u00edodos de tiempo.\n\n\u2022ropa\n\n- La ropa interior con ligas ajustadas en las nalgas (que limitan el flujo de sangre) pueden contribuir a la formaci\u00f3n de la celulitis.\n\nPara conocer m\u00e1s acerca del tema, visita ahora mismo\n\u25ba\u25ba http://eliminartucelulitis.com/piel-de-naranja\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gYtDHcdFNA\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8t9153akw\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNpIqDZci1Y\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV1jYFgRaYU\n\nGoogle +\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/108685665920792732234/posts\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/CelulitisLaCura\nMozilla\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/user/lizethal/\n\nEste v\u00eddeo responde tambi\u00e9n a los siguientes t\u00e9rminos:\n\ncomo quitar la piel de naranja\ncomo eliminar la piel de naranja\nque es la piel de naranja\nque es la celulitis\nejercicios para la celulitis\ncomo eliminar celulitis\ncelulitis en las piernas\ntratamientos para la celulitis\neliminar la celulitis\nremedios para la celulitis\ntipos de celulitis\ncomo se quita la celulitis\ntratamientos anticelul\u00edticos\npiel de naranja", "title": "Piel de Naranja - Descubre que es y Como Quitar esa Horrible Piel de Naranja", "publishedDate": "2013-11-07T01:24:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "B6c5ZzxDUzg", "description": "Tour Scotland video of the St Columba stained glass window in St Margaret's Chapel in Edinburgh Castle, Edinburgh, Scotland.

Con esos compases, el Sevilla control\u00f3 m\u00e1s que domin\u00f3 el partido porque \nlo cierto es que su mayor posesi\u00f3n del esf\u00e9rico se convirti\u00f3 en un bocado al aire, poco que llevarse al hambriento \nest\u00f3mago porque el Benfica es un equipo disciplinado, con mucho cuajo. \n\nEn el primer tiempo, el Benfica se hizo due\u00f1o del bal\u00f3n y el Sevilla trat\u00f3 de sorprender al contragolpe con la rapidez \nde Ivan Rakitic y Carlos Bacca, siendo las mejores ocasiones para el equipo portugu\u00e9s. Esas mejores oportunidades llegaron \nen los dos minutos de descuento de la primera parte. La primera fue del lateral uruguayo Maxi Pereira, que se encontr\u00f3 solo \nfrente a Beto al recibir un pase adelantado de Ruben Amorim, y su remate se estrell\u00f3 en el cuerpo del portero.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, en una aut\u00e9ntica tromba de juego benfiquista, el argentino Nico Gait\u00e1n se encontr\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n solo ante Beto, \npero en el forcejeo con su compatriota Federico Fazio cay\u00f3 al suelo, reclamando penalti.\nLa segunda parte empez\u00f3 como hab\u00eda terminado la primera, con nuevas ocasiones del Benfica, dos claras en el minuto 48. \n\nEn la primera un pase de Maxi Pereira dej\u00f3 solo al brasile\u00f1o Lima, pero cuando su remate se colaba fue sacado por el \nargentino Nico Pareja. El Sevilla tuvo su primera ocasi\u00f3n del partido en el minuto 52 cuando Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes, exjugador \ndel Benfica, recibi\u00f3 un pase de Rakitic que lo dej\u00f3 frente al portero esloveno Jan Oblak pero su disparo se march\u00f3 fuera.\n\nEn el espacio de tres minutos llegaron dos jugadas dudosas en el \u00e1rea sevillista, aunque en ninguna de ellas concedi\u00f3 penal \nel \u00e1rbitro alem\u00e1n Felix Brych. En el 57, Alberto Moreno derrib\u00f3 a Lima y en el 60 un disparo de Rodrigo dio en la mano de \nDaniel Carri\u00e7o. \n\nEl Benfica puso toda la carne en el asador dando entrada a Cardozo por el lateral Siqueira. Emery introdujo a Marko Marin, \nal que retir\u00f3 al rato por su lamentable actitud. En su lugar entr\u00f3 Gameiro, con un esguince en la rodilla sin curar. El \nfranc\u00e9s dio ox\u00edgeno y fe a un equipo con poco aliento. La maldici\u00f3n de Bela Guttman planeaba sobre el Juventus Stadium. \nLos penaltis eran el destino.\nBacca, Mbia, Coke, Gameiro y las dos paradas de Beto dieron la gloria al Sevilla. El portugu\u00e9s se convirti\u00f3 en el nuevo \nPalop, h\u00e9roe por siempre de la porter\u00eda sevillista. Rakitic, el mejor jugador del encuentro por puro talento y capit\u00e1n, \nlevant\u00f3 el trofeo para delirio de un p\u00fablico entregado al orgullo que mostr\u00f3 su equipo para ganar una final imposible.\n\n\nhttp://youtu.be/B72d3LRlMEk", "title": "Carlos Bacca Campe\u00f3n En Europa | Sevilla Campe\u00f3n De La UEFA Europa League", "publishedDate": "2014-05-15T12:00:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "B72xdKfwg4Q", "description": "Extrait de \"20\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle\" - Small, 1998.", "title": "Statics - Par-dessus tout", "publishedDate": "2013-11-11T15:36:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "B730Wg4bFPg", "description": "---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Lucy Hau lucyhau@primesearch.com.hk\nDate: Thu, Oct 2, 2014 at 11:09 AM\nSubject: Fwd: Oct. 1st Breakfast\nTo: stanley hau drstanleyhau@gmail.com, mark hau markhau@gmail.com\n\n\nForgot to cc you earlier.\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Lucy lucyhau@primesearch.com.hk\nDate: Wed, Oct 1, 2014 at 9:24 AM\nSubject: Oct. 1st Breakfast\nTo: Ingrid Hau-text ingridhau@hotmail.com, Michelle Hau mh334@hotmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n\n\n-- \nLucy Hau\n\nManaging Director\nPrime Search Ltd.\nTel. 2167-8309 Direct\nEmail: lucyhau@primesearch.com.hk\nWebsite:  www.primesearch.com.hk\n\nBanking & Finance Recruitment:\n2/F Eton Tower\n8 Hysan Avenue\nCauseway Bay, Hong Kong\n\nGeneral Recruitment:\nSuite 1707, Tower II\nAdmiralty Centre\n18 Harcourt Road, Hong Kong\n\n* * *\nCONFIDENTIAL NOTE:  This email is intended for the named addressee only.

When it reaches maturity it is about the size of a rabbit, making it one of the smallest ungulates. It is found in forests in Java and perhaps Bali, although sightings there have not been verified.\n\nMouse-deer possess a triangular-shaped head, arched back, and round body with elevated rear quarters. The thin, short legs which support the mouse-deer are about the diameter of a pencil. Although Java mouse-deer do not possess antlers or horns like regular deer, male Java mouse-deer have elongated, tusk-like upper canines which protrude downward from the upper jaw along the sides of their mouth. Males use these \u201ctusks\u201d to defend themselves and their mates against rivals. Females can be distinguished from males because they lack these prominent canines, and they are slightly smaller than the males. The average size of a Java mouse-deer ranges from 1\u20132 kg, with females falling on the smaller end of this spectrum. Java mouse-deer can furthermore be distinguished by their lack of upper incisors. The coat coloration of the Java mouse-deer is reddish-brown with a white underside. Pale white spots or vertical markings are also present on the animal\u2019s neck.\n\nThe height of the Java mouse-deer is 30 centimeters (12 inches) on average. With average lengths of 45 centimeters (18 inches) and an average tail length of 5 centimeters (2 inches), the Java mouse-deer is the smallest extant artiodactyl (even-toed hoofed mammal). Java mouse-deer are endothermic and homoeothermic, with an average basal metabolic rate of 4.883 W. Tragulus javanicus also possess the smallest erythrocytes of the mammalian species, and their erythrocytes are unique in that 12.8% of their erythrocytes have pits in them. Pitted erythrocytes are unique and have never been seen before physiologically or pathologically. Java mouse-deer are also considered the most primitive ruminants, thus they provide the living link between non-ruminants and ruminant species.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

The demonstration experiment was carried out on beamline I12 (JEEP) at Diamond Light Source, UK. The external hutch of the JEEP instrument is a large-scale engineering test bed for complex in situ processing and simulation experiments. The hutch incorporates a large capacity translation and rotation table and a selection of detectors for monochromatic and white-beam diffraction and imaging. These capabilities were used to record X-ray movies of a motorcycle internal combustion engine running at 1850 r.p.m. and to measure strain inside the connecting rod via stroboscopic X-ray diffraction measurement. The high penetrating ability and high flux of the X-ray beam at JEEP allowed the observation of inlet and outlet valve motion, as well as that of the piston, connecting rod and the timing chain within the engine. Finally, the dynamic internal strain within the moving connecting rod was evaluated with an accuracy of ~50 \u00d7 10-6.\n\nRead the paper : http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0909049513000885", "title": "A  running internal combustion engine using synchrotron X-ray beams", "publishedDate": "2013-10-15T10:02:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "B7GkZq51c6U", "description": "Video series about healing foods and superfoods and how they empower your body to heal itself.

WWE first produced the event in 1985 to be its premier annual event and has since produced thirty editions, the thirty-first in Santa Clara, California in 2015. WWE regards WrestleMania as its flagship event due to it being the most successful and longest-running professional wrestling event in history. It is considered to be the WWE's Super Bowl equivalent. WrestleMania was conceptualized by WWE owner Vince McMahon.\n\nWrestleMania's widespread success helped transform the professional wrestling industry and make WWE the most successful wrestling promotion in the world. The event has facilitated the rise to stardom of several top WWE wrestlers. Celebrities such as Aretha Franklin, Cyndi Lauper, Muhammad Ali, Mr. T, Alice Cooper, Lawrence Taylor, Pamela Anderson, Mike Tyson, Donald Trump, Floyd Mayweather, Snoop Dogg, Snooki, Sean Combs and others have participated or made special appearances within the events.\n\nWrestleMania propels the worldwide commercial success of the WWE through media, merchandise and shows. All of the events produced, except for Wrestlemania 13, have been sold out within a short period of time, with recent editions being sold out within minutes of tickets going on sale. The first WrestleMania was held in Madison Square Garden in New York City; the 10th and 20th editions were also held there. WrestleMania III in the Detroit suburb of Pontiac, Michigan was the highest-attended indoor sports event in the world, with 93,173 fans in attendance. The record stood until February 14, 2010, when the 2010 NBA All-Star Game broke the indoor sporting event record with an attendance of 108,713 at Cowboys Stadium. All editions of the event have been hosted in North American cities, with 28 in the United States and 2 in Canada.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR WATCHING!", "title": "LEGO WWE Wrestle Mania KnockOff Minifigures World Wrestling Entertainment", "publishedDate": "2014-07-01T18:10:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "B7bNiSDfRs0", "description": "03/20/2014", "title": "Kayla", "publishedDate": "2014-03-21T03:14:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "B7bZv4ITwP4", "description": "Trailer for forthcoming documentary on the 5 Rhythms of Dance, founded by Gabrielle Roth.", "title": "Gabrielle Roth Documentary Trailer", "publishedDate": "2010-03-17T09:48:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "B7bu_3d-MQ4", "description": "How to quickly and simply make a lace flower", "title": "Making a quick lace flower", "publishedDate": "2011-06-03T00:13:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "B7bz0LTLBOE", "description": "Vader shoots on Bret Hart burying Ric Flair.\n\nALL CREDIT TO KAYFABE COMMENTARIES\nhttp://kayfabecommentaries.com\nhttp://kayfabecommentaries.com/DVD_TW_1993.html", "title": "Vader shoots on Bret Hart / Ric Flair", "publishedDate": "2014-08-28T19:43:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "B7cmWqUvdyQ", "description": "Uno dei formaggi pi\u00f9 amati ed odiati,  per via del suo caratteristico profumo, si sposa col risotto.

California law stated that, any settler who's cattle was killed by Indians would receive full compensation for all cattle lost. No government official checked to see it the settlers stories were indeed true. Really no one cared.  This is one of such story.

It was first known in the 17th century, later it became a dangerous devil to human life.\n\nAgain Diabetes is differentiated in to two types\u2019 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Diabetes mellitus is mainly caused by deficiency of insulin due to either lack of energy in pancreas (or) any auto-immune disease. While diabetes insipidus is caused by defect in secretion of vasopressin (Antidiuretic hormone) which is secreted from pituitary gland present in hypothalamus.  Its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the kidney and due to this it control the concentration of urine. But its deficiency caused increased water excretion through urine even in low intake of water.\n\nDiabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are unrelated, although they have similar signs and symptoms like excessive thirst and excessive urination. Diabetes mellitus is more common than the Diabetes insipidus.\n\nDIABETES MELLITUS:  There are mainly three types of Diabetes mellitus \n\nTYPE 1 DIABETES: \nThe body does not produce insulin due to dis-function of pancreas. Such diabetes called as insulin dependent diabetes. People usually develop type-1 diabetes before their 40th year often in early adulthood (or) teenage years.\n\n Today type 1 diabetes has no proper treatment in all over the world.  So these individuals are insulin dependent to rest of their life. Approximately 23 % of all diabetes cases are type 1.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\n\uf0fc Unusual weight loss.\n\uf0fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\uf0fc Excessive thirst.\n\uf0fc Increased urination (sometimes as often as every hour).\n\uf0fc Nausea perhaps vomiting.\n\uf0fc Blurred vision.\n\uf0fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\uf0fc Dry mouth.\n\uf0fc Itching skin.\n\uf0fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nTYPE 2 DIABETES:  Globally as of 2013 an estimated 382 million people have type 2 diabetes worldwide. About 90% cases are type 2 diabetes. This is happening due to lack of energy in the pancreas. So that pancreas cannot produce sufficient insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in our body.\n\n COMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES: \n\n\uf0fc Unusual weight loss (or) gain.\n\uf0fc Excessive thirst.\n\uf0fc Excessive hungry.\n\uf0fc Weak eye sight.\n\uf0fc Increased urination (especially during night times).\n\uf0fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\uf0fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\uf0fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nGESTATION DIABETES: This type of diabetes usually occurs in pregnant mothers during gestation (pregnancy) period. So there is an increase in high blood sugar in pregnant mother. Most gestational diabetes goes away after child birth, but it does put you at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF GESTATION DIABETES: \n\uf0fc Increased urination\n\uf0fc Fatigue (or) tiredness\n\uf0fc Increased thirst\n\uf0fc Nausea and vomiting\n\uf0fc Blurred vision\n\uf0fc Weight loss\n\uf0fc Hormonal imbalance\n\uf0fc Head aches\n\uf0fc Body pain \n\nRead More\n\nhttp://diabetestreatmentinnadipathy.blogspot.in/\n\nFor more information please log on to\n\nwww.nadipathy.in\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYxb4HnTMmGJUTHnGsYbafwN-IwYyNFP\n\nNADIPATHY  DIABETES  TREATMENT CENTERS\n\n1: KAKINADA\nContact No: 0884-6459111\n\n2: HYDERABAD\nContact No: 040-65459111", "title": "Sugar(Diabetes) controlled in 20 days - Nadipathy", "publishedDate": "2014-07-13T05:59:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "B8DshdGLrwo", "description": "Audio Feedback issue cause by Honda Active Noise Cancellation (ANC).

It is necessary to avoid the placements for which a detailed judgement is necessary. \n\nLEVEL 13: I \u306e\u53f3\uff12\u306f\u5584\u3057\u60aa\u3057\u306f\u3068\u3082\u304b\u304f\u3001\u610f\u56f3\u7684\u306a\u63a5\u5730\u3002\u53f3\uff12\u306b\u7acb\u3066\u308b\u64cd\u4f5c\u306f\u7dd1\u306a\u3069\u3082\u81ea\u4fe1\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u56de\u305b\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3002\n\nLEVEL 13: It is necessary to place the I piece vertically in column 9 with confidence.

For this placement I started with IRS(A) and DAS, and then used C and lock. The most efficient timing to lock is at the same frame you input C.

Hawn stars as Joanna Stayton, a snooty heiress who summons carpenter Dean Proffitt (Russell) to her lavish yacht, where she wants an expanded closet constructed that will house her valuable wardrobe. When Dean fails to build the closet out of cedar, Joanna haughtily dismisses him without payment. Later, Joanna falls overboard and is struck by another boat, causing amnesia. Seeing her story on the news, Dean constructs an elaborate scheme to pretend that Joanna is his wife, Annie. Soon, the former rich snob is cleaning Dean's home and babysitting his four rambunctious boys. Although at first she's a disaster, \"Annie\" grows into her role and begins to love being a mom and middle-class wife. When her real husband, Grant (Edward Herrmann), comes looking for her, however, her memory is jogged, and she must decide between a life of privileged ease and a life of happy housework.

In mathematics, the definition of number has been extended over the years to include such numbers as 0, negative numbers, rational numbers, irrational numbers, and complex numbers.\nMathematical operations are certain procedures that take one or more numbers as input and produce a number as output. Unary operations take a single input number and produce a single output number. For example, the successor operation adds 1 to an integer, thus the successor of 4 is 5. Binary operations take two input numbers and produce a single output number. Examples of binary operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The study of numerical operations is called arithmetic.\nA notational symbol that represents a number is called a numeral. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (telephone numbers), for ordering (serial numbers), and for codes (e.g., ISBNs).\nIn common usage, the word number can mean the abstract object, the symbol, or the word for the number.\n\n\nSubscribe Our Channel for more animated and creative videos for kids\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=Kidsclassroom", "title": "Learn Number Names 91 to 100", "publishedDate": "2013-01-01T15:33:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "B8lZ95X0hw0", "description": "", "title": "Curva Sud Reggiana-L'Aquila", "publishedDate": "2014-10-20T23:15:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "B8l_i0Wbhnw", "description": "Addet mich auf Facebook http://www.facebook.com/baestardtv und liket meine Gef\u00e4llt mir Seite http://www.facebook.com/pages/BaestardTV/180552551975949?ref=ts", "title": "Werder Bremen - HSV 2:0 Kommentiert  01.09.2012", "publishedDate": "2012-09-01T20:57:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "B8lhYtLKVwE", "description": "- ODYSSEY - Alirocumab evaluation in the ODYSSEY Combo II, HF I and II and ODYSSEY Long term \nChristopher CANNON - Boston, US\n- SIGNIFY - Ivabradine in patients with stable coronary artery disease without clinical heart failure\nKim FOX - London, GB\n- Pharmacology - Important drug interactions, what you should know ?\nChristian FUNCK-BRENTANO - Paris, FR", "title": "ESC TV 2014 - ISCHEMIA AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE", "publishedDate": "2014-09-17T08:06:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "B8lkMq2djfU", "description": "Chat Dating: http://tinyurl.com/ktyrfcz\n\n\namputee, women amputee girls, women, beautiful amputee woman, girls amputee, Prosthetic Leg, wheelchair, crutches, phocomelia, ladies with disabilities, Beautiful legs, prosthetic legs, practicing, stunning stump, double amputee, Paraplegic girls, legs, Prosthetic", "title": "girl amputee I can walk as far as I like", "publishedDate": "2014-11-20T15:19:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "B8lyy7b5DEY", "description": "http://www.virginiadivorceattorney.com They are the stealth weapons in the divorce process in my opinion.

So we subpoena the company that generates the documents and ask them for copies to make sure that we have all of the documents that are relevant to your case, and its very helpful because sometimes under a request for production of documents to your husband, he doesnt necessarily give us all the documents, but by using a subpoena duces tecum we can go around him and go to his employer, or go to wherever he has accounts and get the information directly from them.  So its a powerful weapon and oftentimes we will find information that was not volunteered to us by reviewing those documents and really help our clients.

I've been wanting this tattoo for a while now but never had the time too. My first tattoo was done by Ali'i Scanlan, owner and artist of Matai Tattoos. He is a licensed tattoo artist with amazing skills. Of course when it was time to make my appointment I gave him a call. \n\nThe night before my appointment he called me saying that the electric at his shop was out because of nearby construction workers that accidentally hit the electric line. He then asked me if I didn't mind tatting at his house. I didn't mind at all. He has done my moms, sisters, cousins, and brother in-laws tattoos.\n\nThe first session was about 4-5 hours long. I left early due to prior arrangements. I scheduled to finish my Tako one week later and got to tat in his shop. \n\nI put together this video for Ali'i to showcase some of his work. All of it was filmed with a GoPro Camera. Enjoy!\n\nThe real octopus tattoo meaning comes from its ability to grow back limbs. Much like humans octopus adapt to the conditions they are in. If they are in a tough situation then octopus will use their brain and respond intelligently much like a human would. The moral of the story? That much like octopus humans can learn to disengage things in their life that are not needed anymore. Bad habits and addictions can all be changed. We like octopus, can adapt to new surroundings and change with the time. \n\nAnother reason why I wanted a Tako as a tattoo is because I love to dive and eat Tako!\n\n\nFor bookings contact Ali'i Scanlan @ 808-330-8947\n\nI do not own this song.\nJ Boog - Let It Blaze\nNo copyright intended.", "title": "Matai Tattoos by Ali'i Scanlan", "publishedDate": "2013-10-08T11:17:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "B8p0Rnm_ICs", "description": "acuerdo,acuerdos,acular,aculea,aculeae,aculeiform,aculeolate,aculeolus,acumble,acuminose,acuminulate,acupress,acupunctuate,acupunctuation,", "title": "\ub2e8\uc21c\uc601\uc5b4 - 30   \ucd95\ud558\ud574\uc694   Congrats!", "publishedDate": "2014-05-09T19:23:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "B8pLf4IZJ88", "description": "Top Angebote - http://www.sonnenklar.tv/videos/video/9146.html?cm_mmc=Media-_-Social+Media-_-Youtube-_-Ober%C3%A4gypten\n\nJetzt den kostenlosen sonnenklar.Tv Newsletter bestellen: http://www.sonnenklar.tv/newsletter.html?cm_mmc=Media-_-Social+Media-_-Youtube-_-Newsletteranmeldung", "title": "Hatschepsut Tempel - Assuan, Ober\u00e4gypten, \u00c4gypten - Urlaub - Reise - Video", "publishedDate": "2011-11-08T19:15:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "B8ppcb8WHHc", "description": "Somehow I overlooked putting this awesome song up.

The plants you see in the pictures can be made up of several plants that are groomed and shaped to make perfect pink mounds.

During a freeze and thaw cycle, moisture can crack terra cotta and the pots will chip and flake.\n\nStep 3: Protect exterior-glazed pots\nStore pots that are glazed on the outside away from wet weather. Since the entire pot isn't protected by glaze, moisture can penetrate the pot and cause it to crack.\n\nStep 4: Protect exterior- and interior-glazed pots\nCare for glass pots, and pots that are glazed inside and out by moving them indoors if they are empty. If they're not empty because you're growing perennials, avoid watering them. During a freeze, wet soil can expand and crack your pot.\n\nStep 5: Consider pot material\nConsider safe winter materials for your pots. Pots made of Styrofoam, plastic, polyurethane, and fiberglass can be left out over the winter, as well as wooden and concrete pots.\n\nStep 6: Protect pots left outdoors\nProtect fragile pots that you leave out over the winter by wrapping them in bubble wrap, covering them with leaves or straw, or placing them somewhere with a warmer area, such as against one of your house's exterior walls.\n\nStep 7: Store pots in a garage or crawl space\nStore your pots in a garage or crawl space if you don't have room in the house. As long as the pots aren't directly exposed to the elements, they won't crack or break.\n\nDid You Know?\nIn 2009, 2 dairy farmers from Connecticut began producing flower pots molded from dried, deodorized cow manure.", "title": "How to Protect Outdoor Flower Pots in the Winter", "publishedDate": "2010-11-24T14:46:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9Mp5HL4btU", "description": "GABRIEL'S OBOE FOR TUBA CLIP\n\nhttp://www.wessex-tubas.co.uk/\nhttp://www.wessex-tubas.com/", "title": "ENNIO MORRICONE THE MISSION - WESSEX TUBAS CD", "publishedDate": "2012-11-11T00:34:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9Mt6JmKSpw", "description": "Servizio di E' TG su Incontro al fiume settembre 2008", "title": "etg2008 incontroalfiume", "publishedDate": "2009-08-14T11:33:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9MwUIMNbww", "description": "Instructions \u00e9crites sur mon blog: http://tricoti-tricoton-tricot-facile.blogspot.fr/2012/10/tricot-point-d-astrakan.html\nPour r\u00e9aliser ce point il faut un nombre de maille qui soit divisible par 4 et ajouter 2 mailles lisieres.", "title": "D.I.Y TUTO TRICOT APPRENDRE A TRICOTER LE POINT D' ASTRAKAN OU TRINITE POINT DE TRICOT FANTAISIE", "publishedDate": "2012-09-09T21:15:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9N74d04kGw", "description": "Comercial de Gel Ego de Colombia del a\u00f1o 2014.", "title": "Comercial Gel Ego Colombia 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-11T22:52:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9NRGudH1-4", "description": "Matthew and I play with a new engine", "title": "Virginian AE 2-10-10-2", "publishedDate": "2011-03-01T00:48:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9NiGYTSG5k", "description": "In this video I will be showing you how to remove a difficulty lock and give you some useful tips for doing so.\nIf you like the video please like and subscribe.", "title": "Minecraft 1.8 difficulty lock removal", "publishedDate": "2014-01-24T01:48:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9NqfJMUynI", "description": "Plastron vesicular secundario a litiasis vesicular resuelto por cirugia laparoscopica", "title": "plastron vesicular resuelto por cirugia laparoscopica", "publishedDate": "2013-04-22T21:58:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9OLwyvFARY", "description": "Inside view of the different options in the sleeping coach onboard the California Zephyr", "title": "Sleeper Coach California Zephyr", "publishedDate": "2013-04-22T07:49:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9OW8DXYdyY", "description": "This video is about Dancers Against Racism", "title": "#DancersAgainstRacism-Gen X - Shatta Wale- You Can't Touch Me PT3", "publishedDate": "2014-06-26T03:03:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9OoCtOd6X4", "description": "East Turkestan ( so-called Xinjiang ) in 2012", "title": "East Turkestan ( so-called Xinjiang ) in 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-12-17T22:14:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9OommJlrPY", "description": "Buddy Wasisname - The Gravel Pits (with lyrics) ... funny song about the may 2-4 weekend.", "title": "Buddy Wasisname - The Gravel Pits (with lyrics)", "publishedDate": "2009-06-01T22:49:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9Ow1-r-Bgw", "description": "Rickard Bindery, based in Chicago, IL, specializes in all types of folding applications, from oversize and map folding down to miniature and pharmaceutical folding.

Each college will have its distinct features, but all of them will emphasise multidisciplinary learning, with intensive small-group sessions to encourage interaction and discussions,\" he said.\n\nMr Lee said UTown is part of broader efforts to upgrade Singapore's tertiary education system. But he believes that improving tertiary education cannot just be about increasing university places.\n\nMr Lee said: \"But improving tertiary education cannot just be about increasing university places. Other countries have found that having large proportions of students going to university does not necessarily guarantee happy outcomes.\n\n\"Take for example South Korea, where 70% of students attend university, but the Korean economy cannot generate jobs for all of them, especially jobs to match their training and their aspirations, so unemployment among university graduates is higher even than graduates of vocational high schools.\n\n\"Or take Denmark, a Scandinavian country, much admired and with much to learn from. 50% of each cohort attend university, but after they graduate, within a year more than a quarter of those who graduate are still unemployed.\"\n\nHe said Singapore's universities must equip students with skills that are relevant in the future, while maintaining their rigour and standards.\n\nAnd this is a consideration even as the government expands the university sector, with Singapore's fifth and sixth universities offering full-time applied degree programmes from next year.\n\nTheir challenge, Mr Lee said, is to keep improving and serving Singaporeans better.\n\nAnd this cannot be measured by international rankings alone.\n\nHe said: \"Because our universities are unlike top universities in bigger countries - Harvard or Stanford in the US, Oxford or Cambridge, Beida or Qinghua in China, University of Tokyo in Japan.\n\n\"These admit a very small percentage of the university students in their countries. Whereas in Singapore, our universities admit the bulk of Singaporean students who are going to university, and therefore, besides maintaining good research rankings our universities have to work hard, to develop each student to his or her full potential.\"\n\nAt the same time, Mr Lee said Singapore's universities have important national and social roles - to develop students' character, imbue in them Singaporean values and ethos, and build lasting friendships.\n\nwww.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/improving-tertiary/851182.html", "title": "PM Lee: Improving tertiary education can't just be about increasing varsity places - 17Oct2013", "publishedDate": "2013-10-18T15:04:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9Sv7MHJlME", "description": "Jon Huntsman and Mitt Romney have a spirited debate on the topic of pulling US troops out of Afghanistan.  \n\nHuntsman tells Romney \"Did you hear what I just said?\" at the 0:59 mark.\n\nRepublican National Security Debate, CNN\nNov 22, 2011", "title": "Huntsman to Romney: \"Did You Hear What I Just Said?\" (on Afghanistan at National Security Debate)", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T05:14:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9TVk_AT1n4", "description": "Tennessee Schmaltz, a klezmer band, performs 'Shalom Aleichem/Eliyahu Hanavi' during their biannual concert at the Laurel Theater on Dec. 3, 2011.

Edwards is the director of the new film The Better Angels, which highlights the formative years of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. In this Big Think interview, Edwards shares thoughts about his visual aesthetic and explains the decision to shoot the film in black and white.\n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://goo.gl/mvSI4O\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\nTranscript: The Better Angels was conceived in black and white from the very beginning. It was just the way that I felt Lincoln existed. Lincoln lives in black and white and I didn\u2019t want to see him in color. The reason why we thought it was appropriate wasn\u2019t purely for aesthetic reasons but also to remove the romance of frontier life, you know, what we imagine with the coonskin caps and the muskets, the Lincoln log cabin. It could lean towards Disneyland or something like that. And so we were after austerity and starkness like you would have in a Bresson picture or a Carl Dreyer picture. And because especially and the frontier life plus Lincoln on top of that, there\u2019s a lot of sentimentality that you could lead into or, you know, just the tropes of just the Americana patriotic story. So yeah, we wanted a bit more integrity to the film than the clich\u00e9\u2019s that could have happened.\n\nWe wanted the film to be a sensory experience. It wasn\u2019t just to be a Wikipedia article about the facts and information of Lincoln\u2019s life. We wanted people to walk beside him, labor with him, cry and laugh with him and black and white abstracts everything to turn it into icons. With color the image is much busier. There\u2019s much more to take in. There\u2019s more specificity to it. Black and white immediately abstracts things and makes symbols out of it so that man or woman suddenly isn\u2019t as specific. They suddenly can turn more almost into the image on the bathroom sign, you know, it\u2019s man and woman as a whole. It gives you a generality in the best way. In addition to the abstraction black and white provides the production design. You know it helped them immensely because, especially with the limited budget we were dealing with. Immediately when you see black and white you feel like you\u2019ve been transported into the past. And so, you know, 20 percent of the art department\u2019s team was accomplished purely by muting the color. Not to say that their job was then easy after that but it definitely gave them a leg up I feel and they would agree.\n\nYou know, the first thing if you say you\u2019re going to shoot black and white is everybody is worried for you. Black and white has a stigma that\u2019s attached to it. People view it as a disadvantage in that you\u2019re limiting your audience, your financial prospects and categorizing your picture as something that it may not be. You know if you shoot black and white people immediately think art or they immediately think serious. And so if someone is to consider black and white for their project I guess I would say the heads up that I would offer is that they need to be prepared to fight for it and lobby for that. Unless they\u2019re just surrounded by a fantastic group that\u2019s immediately encouraging and doesn\u2019t feel that there\u2019s any risk. Schindler\u2019s list I think made like 400 million dollars or something. And so if the story\u2019s there, the performances are there it will connect people. And connections are not in color or in black and white. They\u2019re invisible but just as real.\n\nDirected/Produced by Jonathan Fowler, Elizabeth Rodd, and Dillon Fitton", "title": "The Merits of Black and White Film, with A.J.

This is one of the most extreme challenges a human being can face.  The sailors are alone at sea for months and physical and emotional strength are essential.  Growlers (Icebergs), sea mammals, and massive waves are a constant danger.  On any day the forces of nature can bring an end to the best sailor's well made plans.  They harness the wind, hope for safe passage over the sea and push hard to win.  They are a testament to the audacity of the human spirit.  \n\nOn their journey, they will see the world in a way that few ever have the chance to see it.

With health issues on the rise from cancer to autoimmune, particularly in women, I saw a need for a non-toxic solution to underarm odor.   Introducing toxic chemicals to numerous glands and receptors under our arms, designed to release toxins and cool the body, seems unsconsionable and illogical. \n\nI also found that many of the natural brands were laced with petro-chemical ingredients, with numerous reports that they didn't work.  Resulting in the consumers need for the stronger unnatural lines.  \n\nTo this end, my mission was to create a product that was fully plant based, with constituents that targeted sweat glands and odor causing bacteria -- safely. \nWhy call it the best deodorant, my test market kept saying\", this is the best deodorant\", so there you have it.  I found a need and I filled it, plain and simple.  \n\nMost attest that the best deodorant has a delicate, very pleasant smell.  We do not use essentials oils as fragrance agents in benedetta preparations, and the best deodorant is no exception.  The aroma is from the organic active ingredients, each with a specific use.  To decrease the aroma would alter the effectiveness of the formula.\n\n I Am Proud To Offer You The Best Deodorant:\n- 100% Botanical -- Farm-Sourced \n- 100% Certified Organic Ingredients \n-  94% Certified ** Biodynamic\u00ae Ingredients\n-  96% California Harvest\n\n\u2022 No Propyl Or Methyl Paraben\n\u2022 No Petro -- Chemicals\n\u2022 No Isopropyl Alcohol\n\u2022 No Isopropyl Myristate\n\u2022 No Propylene Glycol\n\u2022 No Aluminum", "title": "The Best Deodorant | Business As Usual", "publishedDate": "2013-08-15T22:08:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9j41FZN-8o", "description": "http://www.imestetico.es/rejuvenecimiento_facial_splendor_tripler_lp.php \n\nTratamiento Splendor Triple R.

The dance is probably a late choreography to the folk song.  There are four versions to the Lawiswis Kawayan dance: one from Kolambugan, Lanao performed by the Waray settlers in that place. Another version from Eastern Samar uses a \"bangko/puruk-anan\" as an implement to the dancing.  The male dancers have a mango leaf on their mouth in one figure of the dance.\n\nThe two versios from Leyte are very distinct from each other. One version is performed with female dancers holding two branches of the \"kalipayan\" bush and are swayed in time to the music. This version is usually done during house blessings.  The last version is the one described in the classic Waray stage play \"Diri Bata, Diri Ulitawo, Diri Inasaw-an\". As described, the dancers hold one internode of a bamboo with leaves on it. The dance ends with a pose holding the nodes into one long bamboo pole.\n\nGiven below is the Lawiswis Kawayan song which was traditionally sung alongwith the musicians who play the dance music:\n      \n      LAWISWIS KAWAYAN\n      (Tanauan, Leyte version)\n\nAko magtatanum lawiswis Kawayan\nAkon la kan Pikoy palatay-latayan\nSalbahis ka Pikoy an imo paghuni\nNaghatag ha kalag, hin' ak' kalipayan\n\nBulahan ka Pikoy, ka Pikoy, tikang panginaun\nNagpili hin sanga,tinugdon, hinapun.\nUnina malupad, paglupad iya karantahun\nKundi pagka kulup mabalik guihapon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch out for my upcoming videos of the following dances:\nTinikling    (Waray)\nItik-itik\nKuratsa Samarnon  (Waray)\nLugkat  (Waray)\nLukay   (Waray)\nAn Marol  (Waray)\nSurtido Samare\u00f1o  (Waray)\nIsmayling    (Amoracion/Amoral)    (Waray)\nAn Lubi   (Waray)\nAn Lab-asero   (Waray)\nCosturera\nMaramyon  (Leyte version)   (Waray)\nPaspe   (Waray)\nGinabato   (Waray)\nPantomina de Samar   (Waray)\nSalampati   (Waray)\nTi Yadut   (Waray)\nLavezares    (Waray/Abaknon)\nJota han Kalipay   (Waray)\nLa Jota Samare\u00f1a   (Waray)\nKuradang   (Waray)\nAn Ulitawo   (Waray)\nBagol   (Waray)\nKadang   (Waray)\nIngkoy-ingkoy  (Samar version)  (Waray)\nPastores    (Samar version)   (Waray)\nEstudiantina    (Capul version) (Abaknon)\nMazurka Capule\u00f1a   (Abaknon)\nPanderetas       (Tanza, Ilo-ilo version) (Ilonggo)\nEnga\u00f1osa  (Pandangyado Mayor)   (Waray)\nPandangyado Cari\u00f1osa      (Samar)  (Waray)\nPandagyado Burawe\u00f1o\nPag-aring   (Basey, Samar)   (Waray)\nJota Paloana   (La Jota Navarra)  (Waray)\nPaso Doble      (Para\u00f1aque version) (Tagalog)\nPolka Tagala\nCulebra    (Bulacan)   (Tagalog)\nJota Cabangan   (Ilocano)\nJota Rizal   (Tagalog)\nJota Ibanag    (Ibanag)\nChotis Dingre\u00f1a   (Ilocano)\nSangkayao   (Bikolano)\nPangkilad   (Bikolano)\nFlaggey Libon    (T'boli)\nMadal Tahu    (T'boli)\nKaral Kafi    (Bilaan)\nAti-ati sa Bukid   (Cuyo, Palawan) (Cuyunin)\nBendayan     (Tchunggas)   (Benguet)\nKadal Onuk      (T'boli Bird Dance)\nKaratong       (excerpt)  (Cuyunin)\nInday na Kunday     (Southern Leyte)\nLikod-likod   (Ormoc, Leyte)\nGapus-gapusay    (Ormoc, Leyte)\nMan-manok    (Bago)\nSohten    (Subanen)\nKhinlesung   (Subanen)\nPangalitawo   (Subanen)\nMadrile\u00f1a    (Pangasinense)\nTakiling    (Kalingga)\nMinandagit   (Manobo)\nInahaw     (Higaonon)\nDugso    (Higaonon)\nSiring  (Tagbanwa)\nSarungkay   (Tagbanwa)\nBalisangkad  (Tagbanwa)\nTugatak   (Tagbanwa)\nDagit-dagit  (Kinaray-a)\nJota Moncade\u00f1a    (Ilocano)\nSurtido Boronganon   (Waray)\nTachok  (Kalingga)\nChalijok   (Kalingga)\nBallangbang  (Applay)\nKarasaguyon    (T'boli)\nPolka Lapis\nApoc   (Ilokano)\nPangalay   (Sama di Laut/Yakan)\nPaunjalay   (All girl version)   (Yakan)\nSilong sa Ganding   (MAguindanao)\nKandalamat sa Gandingan    (MAguindanao)\nIpat             (Demo)  (MAguindanao)\nMaong a Lalong    (Pangasinan)\nPalu-palo   (Ivatan)\nPawakan      (Sabong)   (Maranao)\nPinanyuwan   (Bontoc)\nBuhay sa Bukid  (Tagalog)\nPakkong  (Benguet)\nBuling-buling Pandacan    (Tagalog)\nTacon y Punta Danza   (Bikolano)\nTelipe   (Apayao)", "title": "LAWISWIS KAWAYAN: Philippine Folk Dance", "publishedDate": "2007-07-14T07:08:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9qrvxo0Qnc", "description": "Darksiders II Official Soundtrack\n\nwww.Facebook.Com/Meriyet.Official\nwww.Facebook.Com/MustafAlkan.Meriyet", "title": "TR | Meriyet - Darksiders II Soundtrack (Slipknot - Duality Dubstep Edition)", "publishedDate": "2013-11-26T04:24:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9qsOEUHgrY", "description": "", "title": "Comercial Paulina Vega Dieppa Miss Colombia 2013-2014 / Jolie de Vouge", "publishedDate": "2014-11-02T01:49:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9qztFTwRJI", "description": "Setting the paper type for each cassette can rectify copy quality problems such as poor fusing, image vividness and even jamming.

Oats did not become important to man as early as wheat or barley. Oats probably per\u00adsisted as a weed\u2011like plant in other cereals for centuries prior to being cultivated by itself. Some authorities believe that our present cultivated oats developed as a mutation from wild oats. They think this may have taken place in Asia Minor or south\u00adeastern Europe not long before the birth of Christ.\n\nProbably the oldest known oat grains were found in Egypt among remains of the 12th Dynasty, which was about 2,000 B.C. These probably were weeds and not actually cultivated by the Egyptians. The oldest known cultivated oats were found in caves in Switzerland that are believed to belong to the Bronze Age.\n\nThe history of oats is somewhat clouded because there are so many different species and subspecies, which makes identification of old remains very difficult. The chief modern center of greatest variety of forms is in Asia Minor where most all subspecies are in contact with each other. Many feel that the area with the greatest diversity of types is most likely where a particular plant originated.\n\nOats were first brought to North America with other grains in 1602 and planted on the Elizabeth Islands off the coast of Massachusetts. As early as 1786, George Washington sowed 580 acres to oats. By the 1860s and 1870s, the westward shift of oat acreage in the United States had moved into the middle and upper Mississippi Valley, which is its major area of production today.\n\nPredominant Areas of Oat Production   \nOats are chiefly a European and North American crop. These areas have the cool, moist climate to which oats are best adapted. Russia, Canada, the United States, Finland, and Poland are the leading oat producing countries. Oats are adapted to a wide range of soil types, thus temperature and moisture conditions are the usual limiting factors as to where oats are grown. Perhaps no other country uses oats as much in their cropping system as does Scotland. Some winter oats are produced in the United States, but most are spring oats produced mainly in the north central states.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, the five leading states in production usually were Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, and South Dakota. By the 1960's, the main oat producing area began moving somewhat north and westward. In 2000, the rank of states in order of production was Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin, South Dakota, and Iowa. Iowa acreage peaked at about 6.4 million acres in 1950 and slumped to 270,000 acres, of which only 180,000 acres were harvested, by 2000. The more profitable crop, soybean, has replaced the oat acreage.\n\nUses of Oat\nOats have been used as livestock and human foods since ancient times. Some have been used as pasture, hay or silage; but most have been used as a feed grain. Oat straw has been an important bedding for livestock through history. In Samuel Johnson's dictionary, oats were defined as \"eaten by people in Scotland, but fit only for horses in England.\" The Scotsman's retort to this is, \"That's why England has such good horses, and Scotland has such fine men!\"\n\nIn the United States, oats were formerly grown mainly for horse feed; but with the coming of the motorized age, oats became a feed chiefly for young stock and poultry. There has been an increase in oats used for human food in recent years. Oat Bran has received considerable attention from the medical community for its role in reducing blood cholesterol. Nutrition experts believe that Beta glucans, the water-soluble fibers present in oat bran inhibit cholestrol, which helps prevent heart disease. Nutritionists recommend increased daily intake of fiber, such as that in oat bran, because it assists in regulating gastro-intestinal function.\n\nSeveral breakfast cereals and bread products are made from oat flour and rolled oat products. Oat hulls have also been used as a raw material for fermentation to furfural, a chemical solvent used in refining minerals and for making resin. Another oat product has been used as an antioxidant and stabilizer in ice cream and other dairy products. Iowa continues as a center of oat processing in North America, although the newer processing facilities, built over the last several decades, are more northward in Minnesota and Canada .\n\nA bushel of oats weighs 32 pounds.\n\nHistory and Origin of Wheat", "title": "Oats", "publishedDate": "2013-02-13T19:27:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "B9v8avnYuIs", "description": "Music video by Owl City performing Dreams Don't Turn To Dust.

While at war, he met, saved, and formed a close bond with four fellow soldiers: \"Ter\" (Freud-Nattapong Chartpong), \"Puak\" (Pongsathorn Jongwilas), \"Shin\" (Auttarut Kongrasri), and \"Aey\" (Kantapat Permpoonpatcharasook) -- (The 4 main cast from Phobia 2 Episode \"In The End\") \n\nOnce the war was over, Mak invited his four best friends to visit his home at a town called Phra Khanong. When they arrived to Phra Khanong, Mak introduced them to his beautiful wife \"Nak\" (Davika Hoorne) and \"Dang\" his newborn baby boy. Ter, Puak, Shin, and Aey decided to stay in Phra Khanong for a while and moved into the old house across from Mak's house.\n\nDespite having met Nak and Dang, a village rumor was going around that Nak had died giving birth to her stillborn baby, Dang. \n\nIt turns out that Auntie Priak, owner of the local liquor shop, was the source of the town rumor. This was completely absurd to Ter, Puak, Shin, and Aey. The four friends refused to believe this to be true and were determined to prove the rumors wrong.\n\nAunty Priak was found dead a few days later, her body floating along the river.

Co-authors:  Ryan L. Reid, Angela K. Hawkins,  Sara E. La Roya, Brandi C. Cannon, Timothy J. Verastegui, Victor G. Tarson, Lindsey D. Garza and Christopher P. Randle\n\nA previous pilot study by demonstrated that Phoradendron serotinum seedlings establish haustorial connections following in vitro  germination in 3% hydrogen peroxide. The rate of successful haustorial formation was independent of the age of growth of a woody stem of a known host (Quercus nigra); haustorial establishment occurs with non-distinguishable frequency on second year growth (branches) or old growth (trunks). However, haustoria did not form when germinated seeds are planted on killed wood (logs). This indicates that host cues differ among living and dead tissues. In the present study, we test three hypothetical host cues for successful growth and establishment of haustoria: A) light cues, B) chemical cues associated with the host cork, and C) gaseous cues emanating from living hosts. Three experiments were preformed to test each of these hypothetical cues independently A) by shielding germinated embryos from light during growth, B) by insertion of a non-permeable, but transparent substance between the embryo and the host, and C) by testing the ability of an embryo to orient haustorial growth toward a living twig 5mm distant. Experiments each consisted of 100 replicates at two sites germinated in 3% hydrogen peroxide and planted during late winter. Haustorial growth and establishment was monitored weekly for 16 weeks.", "title": "Amber Faust - Botany 2010", "publishedDate": "2010-08-05T01:38:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "BA2t7Ddpe-E", "description": "\u21202014 \u2013 Starting in 2015, allotments can no longer be used for purchasing, leasing or renting personal property.\n\nhttp://www.dvidshub.net/video/376104/department-defense-changes-allotment-rules", "title": "Department of Defense Changes Allotment Rules", "publishedDate": "2014-11-21T19:11:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "BA3JuZ1PKkA", "description": "Rumunsk\u00e1 gymnastka Andrea Tufa na prostn\u00fdch na Memori\u00e1lu Jana Gajdo\u0161e 15.11.2008.

Processed vermiculite from the WR Grace Libby MT Mine contained tremolite, a form of asbestos, that was allowed to contaminate local homes and has caused hundreds of cases of asbestos-related disease in this small mountain town. Since November, 1999, the US EPA has cleaned up the major source areas of contamination around town. US EPA is now cleaning up smaller sources found in a variety of places such as around homes and businesses. EPA conducts stringent clearance sampling after cleanup and has begun some targeted sampling to measure the effectiveness of cleanup several months later.  In February 2005, seven executives and managers of W. R. Grace were indicted on ten federal criminal counts of knowingly endangering residents of Libby, and concealing information about the health effects of its mining operations. The defendants are also accused of obstructing the government's cleanup efforts and wire fraud.  For more and current information on the asbestos abatement work in Libby, go to the US EPA website at http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/libby/ .  For more information about asbestos and the proposal to finally ban its use in the US, go to Senator Patty Murrays website http://murray.senate.gov/asbestos/index.cfm .

The requirement of objectivity is often regarded as the basic criterion for science.\" (p 59)\n\n* \"The decree of narrow knowledge with a given meaning is not consistent with the school's gender equality efforts.\"(p 64)\n\n* \" A gender-aware and gender sensitive Physics requires a relational approach to Physics and that a lot of the traditional scientific knowledge of physics removed. (p 65) \"\n\n* \"The idea of the scientific thought's supposed supremacy is in conflict with equality and democratic ideals ... If one does not pay attention to this one risks making misleading assessments. For example by unquestioningly assume that scientific thinking is more rational and therefore should replace everyday thinking.(p 24)\"\n\n* \"A school with gender equality works with respect for the pupils's own life world and world view, and a democratic education can then not be a matter of replacing the pupil's \"everyday understanding\" with a\"scientific\" one. According to Sundgren (1996 p.31), there must be a dialogue, so that the school does not exercise symbolic violence on the pupils by imposing a given meaning\". (p 7)\n\n* \"One can, by Sundgren (1996, pp. 86ff), question this tradition that insists on mediating scientific concepts and their given priority of interpretation, as it is invading everyday understanding by also taking over everyday concepts and give them priority in terms of interpretation, such as the concept of \u201cforce\". (p. 24)  \n\n* \"It is likely that a gender equal curriculum would be seen as a challenge or a provocation to many teachers and to many in the scientific community, who would like to see their own knowledge being taught in school.\" (p 65)\n\n* \"Sylvia Benckert (1997) says that Physics as a university discipline seeks an impersonal purity, and a quest (=str\u00e4van) to appear as being above and free from human desires, and it is precisely this apparent impersonality and absence of gender that is tied to notions of masculinity, which makes Physics unattractive to girls.\" (p 16) \n\nNote!

The round building of the Employment Office is a classic example. There were several entrances that led the visitors directly to the departments concerned and when you were finished you would not miss the exit. This principle of open doors and low thresholds was in fact a masterpiece. If you had the courage at the beginning of the 20th century to design an employment office in such a way that the impoverished visitors did not have to wait a long time to receive some financial aid to obtain food, then you had hit a bull's eye. Like those bodies that in 2002/03  have shown the courage to restore the run-down building. \nWalter Gropius really became famous with the transparent glass architecture of the Bauhaus building. Gropius designed the building as a well functioning cover that would bring the outside world in, and let the inside world out.

They have elongated, cylindrical, non-scaled bodies, typically growing to about 2 meters in length, and 20 kilograms in weight. Male electric eels are also much smaller than the female electric eels. They can live from 10 to 22 years in captivity. Electric eels are obligate air-breathers and hence they rise to water surface every about 10 minutes to gulp air before returning to the bottom. As the name implies, the species is capable of generating electric shocks which it uses for different purposes. The coloration of electric eels helps them to blend in very well with their surroundings. Although they do not have very good vision, they enjoy a great sense of smell that they rely upon.\n\nDistribution and habitats: Electric Eel is found in freshwater bodies in South America such as Amazon and Orinoco Rivers. They also live in locations that provide them with food supplies including river floodplains, swamps, creaks and coastal plains. They often live on muddy bottoms in calm water and in stagnant rivers. \n\nFeeding habits: Adult electric eels feed on invertebrates, fish, and small mammals. The young of electric eels may develop cannibalistic behavior whenever their favorite food is not sufficient. In this situation, they may eat eggs, embryos or younger hatchlings. The juveniles of electric fish feed mostly on invertebrates such as shrimp or crab.\n\nReproductive behavior: The mating is prepared for by the male who create the mating nest from his salvia. The female will enter the nest where she lays about 1,200 -- 3,000 eggs. Laid eggs are fertilized by the male's sperm. Afterwards and because fertilized eggs are left unattended, they will experience high losses due to predation ending by low survivors which become adults.\n\nElectric eels in captivity: Keeping electric eels in captivity is difficult and mostly limited to zoos and aquariums. Whenever intended to keep them as pets, special precautions must be secured. As expected, electric eels cannot be kept with any other fish.\n\nElectric discharges: The electric eels produce powerful electric charges through special organs located in the tail. Electric charges produced by electric eels could be either low intensity (voltage) impulses or high intensity impulses. The low impulses are used for sensory perception and would make up the poor vision of electric eels especially in muddy waters. The high intensity charges can reach up to 500 volts or more. Such lethal charge is used during eel's for stunning or killing eel's prey but the charge is also used for self-defense. This high charge could be fatal to human. The electric charges emitted by electric eels is related to their size as smaller eels (about 10 cm in length) can produce charges of up to 100 V while eels with 1-m length or more can produce charges of 450 to 650 volts of electricity with 500 V as the most accepted value. \n\nReferences:\nThe Physics Factbook\nWild Facts\nBioExpedition in Animals\nWikipedia\nSpecies poster, Freshwater aquarium, Sea World", "title": "Electric Eels,  Electrophorus electricus", "publishedDate": "2012-07-07T17:55:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "BAR8CFJZVxo", "description": "", "title": "Singer attachments", "publishedDate": "2013-06-08T23:43:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "BARLmd_Y7ts", "description": "Get those medical secrets: http://www.health101.pw/Medical-Secrets.shtml\n\nThis video shows you how to say or pronounce Dietary Protocol.\n\nAudio is from cancer.gov.", "title": "How to Say or Pronounce Dietary Protocol", "publishedDate": "2013-08-08T04:29:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "BARfDD16dtM", "description": "", "title": "BMW 535d, no particulate filter, v-tech stage 2, 370hp 750nm, double turbo, diesel power Wrapped red", "publishedDate": "2014-10-29T18:47:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "BASEnd9_7fg", "description": "Solo mating dance", "title": "Virgil mating dance", "publishedDate": "2013-05-27T14:05:11.000Z"}]
