Video footage of South Side convenience store clerk Mayura Dissanayake's. The men who tried to hold up his gas station didn't know about his skills.They found out pretty quickly! LOL++\nhttp://redhottopics.com/mma-fighter-beats-up-thieves-at-gas-station-texas/\n\nGas store Clerk who is a MMA Champion used his Skills to surprise the thieves. Feature footage of South Side accommodation store representative Mayura Dissanayake's The men who attempted to hold up his service station didn't know about his skills.Boy they quickly learned. LOL!! \n\nAccording to sources, Dissanayake was behind the counter on July 10 at a Fuel Depot in South Wayside, when he saw his collaborator pulling into the parking garage in the wake of coming back from the bank. The colleague had evidently been trailed by a gathering of men in a SUV, who rose up out of the auto and began thumping him and this being seen on camera by the \"CHAMPION\". \n\nA five-time MMA champion who's been preparing for 10 years, Dissanayake promptly sprung to action, heading out to the parking garage to safeguard his associate. \"The main fellow I saw, I simply kicked him in the face,\" Dissanayake told sources. \"At that point I punched the other gentleman.\" \n\nThe aggressors promptly withdrew, leaving one of the homeboys, 33-year-old Odell Mathis, behind on the ground. Dreading he was outfitted with a blade or weapon, Dissanayake place Mathis into accommodation, in the same way that he does in the ring, until police landed to capture him. \n\nWe should all learn that we must not assume the impossible as a champion can quickly prove you his success, and maybe wont be pleasant but will do it with dignity as the champ did.\n\nhttp://redhottopics.com/mma-fighter-beats-up-thieves-at-gas-station-texas/", "title": "MMA fighter Beats Up Thieves at gas station Texas", "publishedDate": "2014-07-27T18:18:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "8tngIct3Moo", "description": "iTUNES : http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/daroo-charnee-feat.-dj-sanj/id549558972\n\nTRACK - DAROO CHARNEE\nARTIST - ADH\nMUSIC - DJ SANJ\nLABEL - MOVIEBOX", "title": "DAROO CHARNEE | OFFICIAL VIDEO | ADH", "publishedDate": "2012-08-02T10:27:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "8tnyY1WzASU", "description": "Clinical Praxis for 5th year Medical Students.

This resulted in the appearance of the so-called legendary components. With their help some enthusiasts were able to assemble designs which were not supposed to have these components on them. A vivid example of such component is radio valve 6P3S.      6P3S is an output beam tetrode with an indirectly heated oxide cathode. Its heating voltage is 6.3 V. The maximum anode voltage is 400 V. The maximum power dissipated on the anode is 20.5 W. Amplification coefficient is 13.5. Transconductance is 6 mA/V.The valve works in any position. It has a glass design of cylindrical or figured shape. Lifespan is at least 500 hours. It has a 6-pin octal base with the alignment pin. It weighs no more than 70 g. The valve was used for amplifying low-frequency power. It was used in single-cycle and push-pull output stages of receivers and low-frequency amplifiers. The valve was also used as a high-frequency generator in tape recorders, transmitting devices, and other equipment. Its foreign analog designs are 6L6, 6CN5, and EL34.      This valve became legendary because unlike other valves it was sold almost everywhere. But the most important thing was that you could assemble quite a powerful short-wave radio transmitter from this valve. This was actively used by radio pirates.      The history of the valve is also worth mentioning. Our legendary 6P3S went through several modifications. Its family tree starts with a metal 6L6 valve made in 1937. The first glass sample of 6L6 of the late 40s turned out to be unsuccessful because its reduced-size bulb was overheating. Valve 6P3 at the beginning of the 50s which had a glass design despite the absence of \"S\" labeling had poor performance. Only by the middle of the 50s the valve design was improved. This was already a classical 6P3S. It is still manufactured with small improvements. It is labeled 6P3S-E. The valve is highly respected among audiophiles. These valves are still used for developing and assembling various amateur designs. Most often, these are audio-frequency amplifiers.", "title": "6P3S Radio Valve", "publishedDate": "2010-11-30T20:30:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "8u5QHQHvVN4", "description": "", "title": "Reaction of Ferric Solution with Ammonium chloride solution", "publishedDate": "2013-02-19T20:42:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "8u60MOV7HX0", "description": "The Kema 1 is a compact pneumatic bead breaker.

Cold kick is a nice ranged ability to add to the monk and great for single target. It is still best to go with Cyclone Strike for aoe within the spec. With this spec, it requires less gear than the lightning spec I currently run. This spec relies more on crit chance and critical hit damage. It requires significantly less attack speed.\n\nItems with dext and +% cold damage are inexpensive compared to lightning damage with dexterity, so try to get some affordable pieces if you plan to run this. I ran in very low budget gear to do this.\n\nFor this setup, 1-2 targets = Lashing Tail and 3+ targets = Cyclone Strike. Other than that, use Cyclone strike when you need to heal. I specced into the increased spirit regeneration of Breath of Heaven. Again, this spec is significantly less expensive than the Lightning version of the spec. I run with the increased armor with dext, fire res = all res, and life per spirit spent innate abilities.\n\nFor this spec, try to get +% to holy damage and +% to cold damage. Focus on crit chance and crit hit damage. Life on hit is nice to have for the spec, but you need significantly less than with the lightning kick spec.\n\nThe most affordable way to gear for this is to get a chest piece and shoulders from the new Demon set with +cyclone strike damage and +health globes. Then buy a Skorn of at least 1250 dps with a sock, and 500+ life on hit, with 160+ crit hit damage. Its worth putting a Radiant Star Emerald in it. For the legs, get Inna's with the extra stat of fire resist. Get a pair of yellow boots with +% to lashing tail kick and dext and vitality. For your helm, get an Inna's with 6% crit and spirit regeneration (its quite affordable) and if you can, fire resist (less affordable with both). In the socket, put a Radiant Star Amethyst. Try to put diamonds of flawless square+ or Radiant Star Emeralds in the rest of the slots. If you already have +600 or more life on hit unincluding weapon, then you don't even need life on hit on your weapon itself. Try to get a little attack speed, 40% crit (which I don't have currently as my main spec is lightning kick), and at least 300% crit hit damage.\n\nFor a cheap amulet, buy a tals amulet with dexterity on it and cold % damage, or buy a rare ammy with at least 200 dext, 200 vit, some fire res, crit and crit hit damage, and hopefully cold %.\n\nFor Torment II, you will need 75k+ life\n12,000+ health globes\n600+ life on hit\n+8%+ attack speed (I am running in my lightning gear, which is above 25%)\n+40% crit\n+300%+ crit hit damage\nWeapon if 2h must have at least 1250 dps, if 2 1hs then 1150+ dps on both and drop attack speed for crit chance and crit hit damage. Running 2 one handers is perfectly viable, but generally more expensive due to the price of the weapon itself.\n3500+ armor\n840+ all res (including fire res).\n\nYou'd be nuking these mobs a lot faster than me on this video with those stats. Make sure to get demon's set pieces as they all come with fire resist on them. The price of this spec is half the price of my lightning kick spec. You could build the gear with an under 300 million gold budget to start on Torment 1, or under 500 million to start on Torment 2.\n\nThough the demon's gear has been going up in price, the pieces that are oriented for dext and cold% damage have not. I haven't seen others run the spec.\n\nThe nice thing in having the cold kick is its a ranged ability that also slows by 80%. While it may not have the faceroll stunlock affect of the lightning kick, its great for kiting and avoiding damage.\n\nAs for any questions, go ahead and ask away.\n\nThis video is intended for peer entertainment.

Duck Sauce is Armand Van Helden and A-Trak. They met in New York City, make house music and eat Chinese food. In 2010-2011 they literally filled everyone's ears with their smashing hit \"Barbra Streisand\". The song peaked at number one in Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Finland, Switzerland, Austria and Norway. It became a Top10 hit in Italy, UK, France, Germany, Ireland and Australia. In 2011, the song received a Nomination in 54th Grammy Awards for Best Dance Recording. It also reached #1 Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\nAs you know the duck never stops its quack quack and \"It's You\" is the new single by Duck Sauce. Worldwide promo just started and \"It's You\" gets itself talked about almost everywhere, from the US to Japan. It conquered Europe as well, hitting the dance floors in Belgium, the Netherlands, France and UK. It's a real bomb. Well, we should mention that \"It's You\" is the perfect song for a barber shop. It's the most amazing and suitable soundtrack for a hip haircut, dreadlock, afro head, Mohawk, hair extensions, fluorescent dye or a gorgeous teasing. Duck Sauce combs and brushes us with its new massive single (and video!).\nThe sauce makes the difference.

I was able to get some pretty sweet underwater shots while it was next to his kayak. The octopus was kept and enjoyed. It swallowed a pretty large hook so its survival was unlikely. I used a Kodak Playsport (Zx3) to film this.\n\nFurther info for the people commenting:\nFor the record, I didn't kill it, or eat it. I just filmed it. Also, it was not wasted. Its sacrifice was well respected among those that did eat it. I'm not a biologist of any kind, but a simple search on the internet shows that octopuses are not a rare animal. In fact, there is evidence that suggests they are overpopulated in their range. They have a life-span of 3 to 5 years so I'm guessing because of its size that this one was nearing the end of that span. So, I would rather it be killed quickly and not wasted than it be set free to suffer and starve for the last year or so of its life with a six inch hook in its mouth.\n\nTo all the \"Internet Marketers\":\nThe answer is no. \nI am not interested in your \"promotional opportunity\".", "title": "Octopus Caught While Kayak Fishing", "publishedDate": "2011-05-16T20:51:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "8uLiFOVmcUU", "description": "Instruction for using the spit-splice technique to join a new ball of yarn.", "title": "Knitting Help  - Spit Splicing", "publishedDate": "2009-09-02T05:04:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "8uLlC1kXx7Q", "description": "Detailing how to take retinal images with Volk's Pictor", "title": "Volk Pictor - Retinal Imaging", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T13:52:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "8uLuecS_PTk", "description": "Oct.2 (Bloomberg) -- From detonation to diamonds.

Hampered by a thunderstorm and strong currents, divers temporarily halted their search Monday.\n\nFrequent storms, badly maintained vessels and weak enforcement of safety regulations have been blamed for many past accidents at sea in the Phillipines, including in 1987 when the ferry Dona Paz sank after colliding with a fuel tanker, killing more than 4,300 people in the world's worst peacetime maritime disaster.\n\nCebu Gov. Hilario Davide III said 750 passengers and crew of the Thomas Aquinas were rescued. There were no signs of additional survivors late Sunday, though Davide told reporters he had not given up hope.\n\nPestillos, one of several people praised for saving others in the accident, said he distributed life jackets and launched life rafts before creating his own flotation device by tying three life jackets to his navy service rifle.\n\nAs the ferry sank, Pestillos said he fell into water that reeked of oil and was hit by a falling life boat. He said he gave his homemade flotation device to a woman who needed it to stay afloat.\n\nHe said he lost sight of her when he went to help seven others, including two toddlers, toward an overturned life boat.\n\nPestillos said rescuers found his rifle still tied to the life jackets, but it was not clear what happened to the woman.\n\n\"I'm really praying that she also made it to the shore alive,\" he said.\n\nCebu coast guard chief Commodore William Melad said records of hospitals, rescuers and the ferry owner indicate that 754 passengers and 116 crew were aboard the ferry when the accident occurred.\n\nCoast guard deputy chief Rear Adm. Luis Tuason said some of the missing could still be trapped in the sunken ferry, which has been leaking oil.\n\nTransportation Secretary Joseph Abaya said the cargo ship was leaving the Cebu pier when it smashed into the ferry's right side near the rear. He said the ferry was arriving from southern Agusan del Sur province and making a brief stop in Cebu before proceeding to Manila.\n\nOutbound and incoming ships are assigned separate routes in the narrow channel leading to the busy Cebu pier. It is not known if one of the vessels strayed into the wrong lane, coast guard officials said.\n\n\"There was probably a non-observance of rules,\" Melad told reporters in Cebu on Sunday, but he said the investigation will start after the search and rescue work ends.", "title": "50 Killed in Philippines Ferry Accident", "publishedDate": "2013-08-25T06:22:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ue_gSgPwRo", "description": "Memoria Micro Sd\nprotegida contra escritura\nmemoria protegida contra escritura \n2014\nmemoria \nsd\nSD protegida contra escritura\nMICRO protegida contra escritura", "title": "Tutorial- como quitar proteccion contra escritura de una tarjeta Micro SD 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-01-27T02:11:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ue_nL7i10M", "description": "To watch more: http://bit.ly/1vI385V", "title": "Premier Shorts: QPR (H) PREM 14/15", "publishedDate": "2014-11-16T06:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "8uemo-495Wg", "description": "Courtesy of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s \"Trip to the Moon\" (1902) and Facebook's LipCam we learn the exact moment when the Hornist in the Moon first learned to play.

The chloroplast inside the cell looks like a green ribbon.

B O O !!!  Who are these City leaders looking out for? Not you the Home owner. Pasadena will not provide emergency services outside of superficial excepting the loud for the \"mexico areas\". I take offense to that. I take offense that the City Council is now calling itself \"the people\" so it appears as if someone outside of the locked door secret real city council meetings approves of the rapeing in retrospect. repost and look into this travesty - its on your doorstep, in your kitchen, your bath. This is fixable. J.P.L. can still make rockets -  but like the playground bully has to learn to pee in the right place and not on people or in the drinking fountain... Hahamonga is not the right place. I love Pasadena. I love Hahamonga. I love J. P. L. yep. I Love NASA. I Love you America. I love you Every place else. I love love Earth. I love the Universe, some of my favorite people live here. So why is the importance of people's Health being dictated by people who hate people? Check it Out. Follow the trail from 2194 Corson The killing Jar right up the Mountain to Jack's Lab. Monk Hill treatment Plant that J.P.L. was forced to install for the immediate pricy Gentrified Community at the tip of Lincoln up in Alta Dena. Too Many Doctors with Cancer right there now to hide. People who handle lots of water and treatment are being treated t a phenomenally higher rate than others from the National Average. Eric says its because people are to fat. - Poisons Esp. rocket fuel attacks the bodes ability to regulate Fat production. So it's my fat ass's fault that I got a stroke - never mind the Poisonous gas rising up from the City's underground poison sump under 2194 - 2192 Corson. It leads right back to its Maker. Save Hahamonga. Save Pasadena. Save the People in the region. Retool J. P. L. to run a CLOSED SYSTEM RECYCLING AND TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR ALL ITS WASTE INC SEWAGE AND DRAIN WATER AS PRESCRIBED BY LAW. Law - oh that. Remember that Law only means something if its enforced. Why hasn't ANYONE enforced the orders already in place? Because the public has been lied to every day for over 20 years. There are more than 9,871 really bad toxic chemicals that the E. P. A. monitors with really special very sensitive equipment. When the EPA declares a place to be a Site its really Bad and usually takes a while to Clean up under the Watchful Eye of Big Brother E. P. A.  When one of those places is so Obscenely Bad far and above the Ordinary E.P.A. sites its called a SUPERFUND SITE. Yep this is a true dark distinction as Billions of Dollars are allocated for the rejuvenating of U. S. Soil after some uncaring greedy bastard(s) approved it with out regard to Human Health. This is happening way too much across America. So anyway a Superfund is Super Everything. This is why instead of using High tech state of the art sensing and monitoring equipment over seen by highly trained and protected professionals as normally would be expected in a Haz Mat monitoring situation, especially if the POSSIBILITY exists for direct or cross contamination such as a sloshing around or in an industrial stream bank. So what does the Rocket Science Industry bring us the little people whom live work get treated play shop in Pasadena Ca protect us with? Space suit wearing robots? No No No. Little girls with ph papers. Now this is really sick. Showing us how safe the water from JPL's Ballooning Colon with the healthy looking children. This is Nazi Style hatred for mankind. Eugenics is a Nazi - Thing  that came FROM Pasadena to Germany before Hitler.\n   Achtung  - Pasadena People - Dr. Eric Walsh has prepared a cure for your kind. Oh Yea. Nazi and Eugenics has evolved to accept the Other Races temporally during the take over phase of the Fourth Reich beginning with Pasadena it self. Pasadena.   I can guarantee you that these kids are not the children of our fearless leaders who don't live here.

Many seem to be quite effective as well, the question today is what about Muscle Pharm's Creatine? Does it belong with the best? Let's take a look at the label.\nSo here it claims that it promotes strength, power and endurance. It consists of 5 superior creatine blends, no loading is required, and it claims to be pharmaceutical quality. That all sounds really good, let's see what real consumers have been saying about this supplement, time for some social proof.\n\nReported Pros:\n1) Noticeable increase in strength\n2) Excellent Price\n3) Improves endurance\n4) No loading\n \nReported Cons:\n1) A hassle to mix\n2) Bloated feeling\n3) No flavor choice\n4) Some don't find it very effective\n\nSo far it's looking like a good creatine product for most. Here we see that bodybuilding.com provides 167 ratings scoring 8.6. Supplementreviews.com shows 10 ratings scoring a less impressive 7.2. This gives us a total of 177 ratings scoring 8.52. To investigate further let's dig into the active ingredients.\n\nCreaPure:\n- CreaPure is a micronized creatine monohydrate made in Germany. \n- CreaPure claims to be the only Creatine to be constantly tested to ensure purity and avoid unnecessary by-products. \n- CreaPure maintains an impressive 99.99% Creatine monohydrate content.\n- It is recommended to always mix CreaPure with caffeine-free liquids like water or fruit juice. A daily dosage of 3 grams must be maintained to see immediate results.\n \nCreatine AAB:\n- Creatine AAB stands for Creatine Alpha Amino-N Butyrate. \n- This Creatine blend is intended to improve blood circulation and the transportation of oxygen which is especially important to the vital organs that manufacture energy. \n- This results in a slower breakdown of proteins which maintains the structure of the muscles.\n \nDiCreatine Malate:\n- DiCreatine Malate is a patented version of creatine combined with malic acid. \n- Makers claim it to be an improved version that will promote muscle gain and increased strength when compared to standard creatines.\n- The malic acid component is greatly involved with the body's Kreb's cycle and, therefore, provides cellular energy that is required for providing stamina to perform strenuous exercises and workouts, such as weightlifting.\n \nCreatine Nitrate:\n- Creatine Nitrate is another creatine patent that has great water solubility making it easier to prepare and absorb in the body. \n- But this type of creatine is not as popular as others for there are a few speculated side effects of nitrate. \n- Dangers include the possibility of dramatic lowering of the blood pressure.\n \nCon-Cret:\n- Con-Cret is Creatine HCl which is creatine infused with hydrochloric acid. \n- HCL is supposed to allow faster absorption of creatine making a pre-workout intake immediately effective. \n- A 3 gram serving is the recommended daily dosage.\n- One study performed in the University of Manitoba 2009 reported that creatine HCL is in fact easier for the body to absorb.\nFinal Verdict\nOverall this supplement looks to be effective for most. Looking at some reviews it's clear that some people question the quality of the creatine. But all in all, the user can expect this creatine to:\n- Provide noticeable strength gains\n- Come at a low cost per serving\n- Allow for no loading\n- Improve endurance\nHowever, the draw backs to consider are:\n- Not everyone finds it effective\n- Some feel bloated\n- Lacks flavor\n- Doesn't mix perfectly\nIF you'd like to know when musclepharm creatine is having a promotion, visit rawmusclegain.com and sign up using our form.

This is to maintain \"state security\" and \"social stability\".\n\nZhang Zanning, Prof. of Southeast University School of Law,\nsaid that \"maintaining stability above all\" is in fact undermining the law. It would mean that there is no law.\n\"Stability\" is above the administration of justice and the\nConstitution, that is an authoritarian regime; the \"rule of man\".\n\nZhang Zanning (law Prof.): \"The fundamental root\nof \"instability\" is judicial injustice, and others injustice, such as administrative injustice and the injustice of the system.\nThat is the leading cause of fake and false charges and\nthe existence of activists.\nThat's why maintaining \"stability\" was launched. Maintaining\n\"stability\", in fact, is like \"drinking poison to quench thirst\".\nThe more action taken to strengthen the so-called \"stability\",\nthe more instability is taking place.\nOnly way to solve fake and false charges is justice,\nand in this case, the injustices will be reduced.\"\n\nScholars commented that in China, judicatory has\nadministrative characteristics, and has a state-character.\nNo matter who is a top judge of the Supreme Court, without\nreform, \"judicial independence\" will not be achieved.\n\nChen Yongmiao (Beijing constitutional scholar): \"Judicial\npersonnel management is controlled by the CCP regime.\nIn their hands, there is no way to achieve judicial justice.\nBecause of this, judicial corruption exists.\"\n\nZhang Zanning: \"In my view, the judiciary must\nbe independent. Otherwise, it is fake.\nIf a judiciary belongs to a specific department or a party\ngroup, then there is no justice at all.\n\nChen Yongmiao predicted that if the judiciary is not\nindependent, next years annual report will be the same.\nIt will be possible to have more strengthening of control,\nand intensifying of maintaining social \"stability\".\n\nChen Yongmiao (Beijing constitutional scholar): \"Without\njudicial independence, judges cannot apply justice.\nEven he (Wang Shengjun) mentioned good intent in the\nreport, but once it is operated under the Party system, it naturally will create judicial corruption.\nUnder the Party's leadership, this system will\nremain unchanged.\"\n\nZhang Zanning said that Judicial independence is the\nfoundation of justice.\nFor a country, when democracy is really implemented, and\npeople can truly elect their government, this government can be trusted by people.\nThe judicial system will allow justice,\nand society will be stable.\n\n\u300a\u795e\u97f5\u300b2011\u4e16\u754c\u5de1\u6f14\u65b0\u4eae\u70b9\nhttp://www.ShenYunPerformingArts.org/", "title": "Maintaining \"Stability\" Intensified; Judiciary Goes Backwards", "publishedDate": "2012-03-14T09:31:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vHNcNrojDM", "description": "Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg (1874-1951)\n\n3 Klavier St\u00fccke op. 11 (1909)\nMaurizio Pollini, piano\n\nThe historical and musical significance of Schoenberg's Three Piano Pieces Op. 11 can hardly be overstated. The consensus today that they are landmarks, situated as his \"earliest consistently atonal opus\" (in the words of George Perle), belies a long history of analyses by resistant theorists who attempted to valiantly shoehorn them, however awkwardly, into the syntax of tonal harmony. Where one theorist heard the opening thematic material of the first piece as outlining the Phrygian mode, another heard it as an E major-minor, with F as a lower neighbor note. Another said, amazingly, \"Of atonality there is no trace. One might possibly speak, however, of polytonality, of different tonalities heard simultaneously.\" \n\nSchoenberg saw music history as moving inevitably forward. The introduction of equal temperament made possible chromaticism, modulation techniques, and the tonal system of the eighteenth century. But Schoenberg saw that, carried to its logical conclusion, tonal music contained within itself the seeds of its own destruction. As Charles Wuorinen has put it, atonality was the end result of \"the tendency within tonal music for an ever-increasing number of foreign, ancillary tones to be introduced into the harmonic fabric.\" (Wuorinen) These pieces were Schoenberg's first conscious steps on the path toward serialism.\n\nLooking back to 1909, Schoenberg had this to say forty years later: \"My technique and style have not been developed by a conscious procedure. Reviewing this development today it seems to me that I have moved in many roundabout ways, sometimes advancing slowly, sometimes speedily, sometimes even falling back several steps. The most decisive steps forward occurred in the Two Songs, Op. 14, and in the Three Piano Pieces, Op. 11.\" (Schoenberg)\n\nYet despite Schoenberg's insistence that he proceeded by conservative and careful steps rather than one radical leap, what he achieved in Op. 11 was quite startling, and dramatically new.  In the words of Eric Salzman, \"For the first time, every sound, every interval, every event has a unique and independent value, free of the hierarchies of tonal discourse--and equally free of the meanings formerly invested in them. Thematic development remains, but totally abstracted from its old contexts.\"\n\nThis achievement alone earns these pieces a place as important pivotal works of the twentieth century.\n\nFrom: http://www.colleges.org/techcenter/music/modules/op11/op11pages/signif1.html", "title": "Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg - 3 Klavier St\u00fccke op. 11, no. 3", "publishedDate": "2009-12-13T22:57:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vHPjWexhBU", "description": "Learn how to keep your clematis blooming for two months!

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Michigan State vs Duke | 2014-15 ACC Men's Basketball Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-11-19T04:08:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vSenWuoEKE", "description": "Ohjaus: Niko Kempas\nKuvaus: Vincent Nordstr\u00f6m, Ville H\u00e4yrinen & Jere Hyv\u00f6nen\nEditointi: Vincent Nordstr\u00f6m\nKopterikuvista kiitos Aerial Media (www.aerialmedia.fi)\nBiitti: 10th Wonder\n\n\nK\u00e4yk\u00e4\u00e4 tykk\u00e4\u00e4 Solonen tai Kosola artistiprofiileista facebookis ni tied\u00e4tte mis menn\u00e4\u00e4, miss\u00e4 on keikkoja ja ket\u00e4 n\u00e4\u00e4 j\u00e4b\u00e4t on. http://on.fb.me/16NmU0H & http://on.fb.me/15dYFM8", "title": "Solonen & Kosola - Kolmetoista kertaa kovempi ku kukaan", "publishedDate": "2013-08-27T10:20:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vSfKe8Qs4E", "description": "The video shows a Bristol Centaurus 18-cylinder sleeve valve radial engine running up during a display at Old Warden in the UK.\n\n--\n\nhttp://www.aviationfilm.com\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Historical Aviation Film Unit\n\nThis video material may not be reproduced in any form (except as an embedded video on any other website), without the written permission of the Historical Aviation Film Unit.", "title": "Engine: Bristol Centaurus 18-cylinder engine run", "publishedDate": "2013-12-08T22:30:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vT8zr87qtw", "description": "The official refuse trailer.

ERIC) MV", "publishedDate": "2014-02-06T03:00:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vZoOesDCug", "description": "You asked a really good question. You want to know if you can be ovulating even though your home prediction test kit says that you haven't ovulated yet. Now, here's a little background information about how they work. Ovulation kits detect a surge in LH, which is Luteinizing Hormone, and that's what happens when you ovulate. A home test kit can get a positive result 16 to 48 hours before you actually ovulate. So, there's a big window there.\n\nThe fact that you haven't seen a positive result yet leads me to believe that you haven't ovulated yet. But, because there's always a chance that, you know, tests can be wrong. There are rare cases where they are. It never hurts to have intercourse every other day until you're through your most fertile window.

Monoxides react with water to give corresponding hydroxides with the formula M OHtwice. The conductivities of alkaline earth metal halides decrease from Beryllium to Barium in molten state, but increase in aqueous solution. 1 Except Beryllium halides, all the other group IIA metal halide are ionic in nature.\nAnomalous property of Beryllium:Beryllium differs from the other alkaline earth metals because of its small size and high electro negativity.  Beryllium differs from the other elements in the following aspects:1 Beryllium compounds are predominantly covalent due to its high polarizing power and its salts are readily hydrolysed.2 Beryllium is not easily affected by dry air and does not decompose water at ordinary temperature.3 Beryllium is an amphoteric metal. It disolves in alkali solutions forming beryllates.4 BeSO4 is soluble in water where as the sulphates of Calcium, Strontium and Barium are not soluble.5 Beryllium and its salts do not respond to flame test while calcium, Strontium and Barium give Characteristic flame colours. 6 Beryllium forms many complexes while the heavier elements do not show a great tendency to form complexes.7 Beryllium has a maximum covalency of 4 while other can have a maximum covalence of 6.es Cal, SrO and Peroxides CaO2, SrO2\n\n7 Active Technology Solutions Pvt.Ltd. is an educational 3D digital content provider for\nK-12.

They are obviously closer related to the snakes. Within the Squamata on their stem-line directed to Varanus, character-transformations due to evolution formed a distinctly elongated slender tongue with a forefront being deeply bifurcated. The conspicuous behaviour of e.g. Varanus or snakes to dart its tongue in and out has to be interpreted in context of Jacobson's organ, which very sensitively detects odors. These lizards/snakes therefore orientate themselves mainly using this olfactory sense, but also optically.\nThe filmed experiment with a Varanus (niloticus?) ornatus shows a goldfish in a glas container with water. First the lizard recognizes his prey optically and attacks the glas container. Finally it begins orientating more precisely using his bifurcated tongue. The frequency of darting the tongue in and out gains speed as nearer the animal comes to the prey.\nThe male Varanus ornatus specimen \"Zacharias\" was filmed in 2008. At this time it had an age of about 15 years. It died in March 2009.", "title": "Monitor lizard (Varanus ornatus) hunting for a goldfish", "publishedDate": "2011-08-01T13:32:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vgMwvB5wmA", "description": "", "title": "Un Cairoli convincente batte lo Spallanzani nella prima partita stagionale", "publishedDate": "2014-03-14T11:23:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vgqLwDxJ6I", "description": "from My Contribution To The Global Warming (2012)\n\nBuy it on iTunes : bit.ly/Z9QLMF\nBuy it on Beatport : btprt.dj/13WOJ6Y\n\nwww.etiennedecrecy.fr", "title": "Etienne de Crecy - Beatcrush", "publishedDate": "2013-03-15T16:38:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vgyrfaJWyU", "description": "iTUNES: http://smarturl.it/hwm-exister\nMERCH: http://riserecords.merchnow.com/search/?q=hot+water+music\n\nNever mind all the riddles, we're all sick the same\nBled dry and beaten but still quick to blame\nAll the marks, all the nicks on all the ragged excuses \n\nNever mind all the railing, they'll all get their own\nShot down and plundered, shipped out and sold\nFor all the marks, all the nicks by all the pessimistic tricks\n\nWe are here and time is relevant to mainline every worthy element.\n\nNever mind all the riddles, we're all sick the same \nBled dry and beaten for there ain't no shame\nIn taking hits, cuts or nicks as long as there's no excuses \n\nWe are here and time is relevant to mainline every worthy element\n\nOr are we emptiness?\nAre we dead to this?\nWhen will it all end?\nMay we cure the catalyst?\nAre we emptiness?\nAre we dead to this?\n\nWe are here and time is relevant to mainline every worthy element now", "title": "Hot Water Music - Mainline", "publishedDate": "2012-05-12T14:42:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vh7TTZwAeQ", "description": "My freshly molted Lasiodora parahybana was wiggling it's spinnerets a lot, so I took a video and sped it up a little.", "title": "HD - Macro - Dance of the Spinnerets", "publishedDate": "2009-01-08T01:33:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vhG5zMVy5Q", "description": "Just playing my happy song next to a Friends of Trees Tree\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrotia", "title": "Street Tree Sonata", "publishedDate": "2014-06-13T21:15:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vhVcQGRQjY", "description": "Because there are other ways to play Dark Souls II than mindlessly swinging a weapon...", "title": "MAYHEM (Dark Souls II) Passive Aggression", "publishedDate": "2014-04-22T09:37:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vhiUG5xMPY", "description": "NOTE: You won't understand this video unless you watch Potter Puppets Mysterious Ticking Noise.

Kill the police reinforcements until your wanted level (see bottom right of the screen) is maxed out. This will only take a minute or two.\nNow get into a vehicle and drive to a location where the cops cannot follow you. There is a really great spot for this in the very north of the \"The Loop\" district. Below the most northern street is a tunnel. At the western end of the tunnel is a room behind a gate.

Ganglia are clusters of nerve endings called nexuses and essential ganglia are located throughout the sympathetic nervous system.

Our philosophy is that, as with most products and services these days, you get what you pay for. When it comes to tattoos, what you're paying for is (read: should be) experience, professionalism, and longevity. At Damascus Tattoo, that's exactly what you're gonna get, in spades!\n\nDon't be practice skin! You're a collector and as anyone that's serious about their permanent art collection knows, your tattoo artist should treat your work with the skill and respect that such permanence deserves. Leave the tattoo party, scratchy, bullshit work to the kids whose parents didn't love them enough. Let the experience of the Bunch speak for itself.....www.dmastattoo.com\n\nOk, so maybe you're not a serious collector...yet. Maybe you've never had a positive experience getting a tattoo. That's probably because you've never been to a PROFESSIONAL artist before. Unfortunately, it doesn't take much to put together a shoddy, quick and dirty, kitchen magician tattoo 'business'. At DTC, we put on our scorn-face at those degenerates. Here you'll only be treated with the utmost care, using nothing but top-of-the-line equipment and pigments, in a comfortable and, most importantly, clean studio. That's what being a professional is all about; taking care of you, our valued clients!\n\nChances are, you'll spend oodles more on your next car than you do on your next tattoo (unless you don't mind drivin' a beater around). That car isn't going to last the rest of your life, but your tattoo should! Through a combination of experience and high quiality equipment and inks, we guarantee that your tattoo will look just as amazing down the road as it does the day it's all healed up (cause let's face it, they never look quite the same once they're healed as they do the day they're done!). Tattoo's truly are a lifestyle and we aim to keep true to both parts of that word.\n\nNow that you know what we're all about over here, it's time to send you on your way. It's been real, but seriously, we've got work to do. Why don't you go check out the site or maybe learn a little more about the artists. You might even want to call us to set up your next appointment. www.dmastattoo.com (301) 253-8800", "title": "Damascus Tattoo Co  2014", "publishedDate": "2014-03-12T20:59:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vwZsgROTKA", "description": "nerf pinpoint sight portugues                      acessem!!! http://www.newsnerf.blogspot.com.br/", "title": "Nerf Mission Kit Pinpoint Sight Unboxing Portugues Brasil (pt-br)", "publishedDate": "2012-11-16T00:23:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "8vwtdkx-XhA", "description": "This is my review on the GOLD standard Casein From Optimum Nutrition.

Given within the proper window of opportunity, TPA drugs can dissolve clots and minimize strokes.\n\n\"The sooner we can get the patient to the treatment table and give the treatment the more brain tissue we can save. And we learned now over the years and with very good data the golden hour i.e. the time line, 60 minutes after the patient walks thru the door, is the best time line we can give the patients the clot busting medicines,\" says Dr. Nima Mowzoon, neurologist on Lee Memorial Health System's medical staff. \n\nProven protocols allow the administration of clot-busters for up to 3 hours; time being a valuable commodity.\n\nThe impact of a stroke can be catastrophic to the brain. Studies show about 1-million nerve cells die every minute. That's why researchers looked for ways to expand treatment options. One of the most cutting-edge is to surgically remove the clot from the blood vessel.\n\n\"We thought of what else can we do that goes beyond the community standard to give our patients in the community the best quality of care that they could possibly get. Well the answer is thrombectomy,\" says Dr. Mowzoon. \n\nThrombectomy, also called clot retrieval, may be an option for patients who are timing out on the clot-busting drug, but still have salvageable brain. The delicate procedure is performed by an endovascular surgeon.\n\n\"Sometimes what he does is administer that TPA substance clot buster while he's attempting to retrieve the clot. So this is state-of-the-art technique that really isn't available in a lot of places around the nation. And we've started to implement these protocols now,\" says Dr. Mowzoon. \n\nThe cutting edge procedure is being established within the stroke unit at Gulf Coast Medical Center.\n\n\"The hospital has invested and bought and has employed this new program with CT angiogram and perfusion studies, which we can accurately map out which area of brain has already died and which area of the brain can die if we don't do anything about it,\" says Dr. Mowzoon. \n\nSo when the right opportunity strikes, there may be more treatment options for more people. \n\nView More Health Matters video segments at leememorial.org/healthmatters/\n \nLee Memorial Health System in Fort Myers, FL is the largest network of medical care facilities in Southwest Florida and is highly respected for its expertise, innovation and quality of care.

The goat is a member of the family Bovidae and is closely related to the sheep as both are in the goat-antelope subfamily Caprinae. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat. Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species, and have been used for their milk, meat, hair, and skins over much of the world. In 2011, there were more than 924 million live goats around the globe, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Female goats are referred to as \"does\" or \"nannies\", intact males as \"bucks\" or \"billies\", and their offspring are \"kids\". Castrated males are \"wethers\". Goat meat from younger animals is called \"kid\" or cabrito (Spanish), and from older animals is simply known as \"goat\" or sometimes called chevon (French), or in some areas \"mutton\" (which more often refers to adult sheep meat).  Etymology The Modern English word goat comes from Old English g\u0101t \"she-goat, goat in general\", which in turn derives from Proto-Germanic *gaitaz (cf. Dutch/Icelandic geit, German Gei\u00df, and Gothic gaits), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *\u01f5\u02b0aidos meaning \"young goat\" (cf. Latin haedus \"kid\"), itself perhaps from a root meaning \"jump\" (assuming that Old Church Slavonic zaj\u0119c\u01d0 \"hare\", Sanskrit jih\u012bte \"he moves\" are related)[citation needed]. To refer to the male, Old English used bucca (giving modern buck) until ousted by hegote, hegoote in the late 12th century. Nanny goat (females) originated in the 18th century and billy goat (for males) in the 19th. History Horn cores from the Neolithic village of Atlit Yam Goats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans. The mountain pygmy most recent genetic analysis confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild Bezoar ibex of the Zagros Mountains are the likely origin of almost all domestic goats today. Neolithic farmers began to herd wild goats for easy access to milk and meat, primarily, as well as for their dung, which was used as fuel, and their bones, hair, blow blows and sinew for clothing, building, and tools billy . The earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 years before present are found in Ganj Dareh in Iran. buck bucks fight fighting fights Goat remains have been found at archaeological sites in Jericho, Choga Mami Djeitun and \u00c7ay\u00f6n\u00fc, dating the domestication of goats in pygmy sheeps pygmies Western faint faints fainting mate mates mating Asia at between 8000 and 9000 years ago rabid rabies billy goat goats disease diseases diseased farm farms animal animals chicken chickens hen hens rooster rooster mates mate mating sex male female tips milk milks funniest home video videos fail fails tape tapes camera cameras tip advice farming farmer farmers field fields funny comedy strange odd weird horse horses cattle cow fox wolf wolves hyena hyenas pen pens cage cages caged crazy insane weird odd comedy comedian birth calves calf baby babies puppy puppies feed feeding feeds food Studies of DNA evidence suggests 10,000 years BP as the domestication date. Historically, goat hide has been used for water and wine bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale. It has also been used to produce parchment. Anatomy and health Goats are considered small livestock animals, compared to bigger animals such as cattle, camels and horses, but larger than microlivestock such as poultry, rabbits, cavies, and bees. Each recognized breed of goats has specific weight ranges, which vary from over 300 lbs for bucks of larger breeds such as the Boer, to 45 to 60 lbs for smaller goat does. Within each breed, different strains or bloodlines may have different recognized sizes. At the bottom of the size range are miniature breeds such as the African Pigmy, which stand 16 to 23 inches at the shoulder as adults Eye with horizontal diet diets pupil Most goats naturally have two horns, of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed. Goats have horns unless they are \"polled\" (meaning, genetically hornless) or the horns have been removed, typically soon after birth.[10] There have been incidents of polycerate goats (having as many as eight horns), although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited. The horns are most typically removed in commercial dairy goat herds, to reduce the injuries to humans and other goats. Unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled, as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked. Breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring, which are typically sterile. Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins, and are used for defense, dominance, and territoriality. Goats are ruminants. They have a four-chambered stomach consisting of the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum, and the abomasum", "title": "Man Gets Violently Attacked By 3 Baby Goats", "publishedDate": "2014-05-23T03:07:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "8wBga0Bzxx0", "description": "DO NOT REUP\nYesung *.* The boys look gorgeous in casual clothes.

We think she bruised her stifle after she took a slip and big crash through an oxer at Wales, so she had some time off (meant she couldn't go to the Hickstead Derby... Willy gave it a go in her place!) and I've been slowly bringing her fitness back up and this was the first time I had jumped her in a couple of months! \n\nPlease excuse me jibbing on at her, but I was slightly over the moon to have her back in action and feeling wonderful again! I think she was very pleased to be doing it again too.\n\nSo! Now she's sound and fit again, we've booked in for the Amateurs at Wales next week as our first show back! I would have liked to do the 110 package on her again, but have entered the 1m for abit of fun and to get our eye back in again.\n\nFingers crossed we have a good one!\n\nHope all is well\n\nJo and the gang!\nxxx\n\nP.s.

He's Axel Foley, a Detroit detective who's been sent on involuntary vacation because he refuses to drop his intention of avenging his friend's murder. Warned by Beverly Hills police chief Ronny Cox to stay out of trouble, Foley nonetheless dogs the trail of above-the-law Steven Berkoff, the British crime czar who was responsible for the murder of Foley's friend. With the help of sympathetic local cops Judge Reinhold and John Ashton and lady friend Lisa Eilbacher, Foley attempts to corner Berkoff in his mansion, which leads to a wild slapsticky shootout.\n\n\"beverly hills cop\",\"beverly hills cop clip\",\"beverly hills cop theme\",\"beverly hills cop part 1\",\"beverly hills cop soundtrack\",\"beverly hills cop 2\",\"eddie murphy\",\"joel bailey\",\"art kimbro\",\"martin brest\",\"action comedies\",\"african-american comedies\",blockbusters,comedy,\"jerry bruckheimer\",\"mike moder\",\"linda horner\",\"communication videos\",\"duty videos\",\"street videos\",\"det axel foley\",\"det foster\",\"det mccabe\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++5220,/m/09tdns8,/m/0f7hc", "title": "Beverly Hills Cop (7/10) Movie CLIP - Letting It Flow (1984) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-09T19:27:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "8wa04qYsaps", "description": "", "title": "Excitation Contraction Coupling", "publishedDate": "2012-11-16T03:53:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "8wa8XNWbB4c", "description": "Starting your own project today and visit our website www.makeblock.cc Contact us: christina@makeblock.cc", "title": "Makeblock Omnidirectional Tank Project", "publishedDate": "2014-01-22T02:11:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "8waC4ecVfMY", "description": "C\u00e2y l\u00e1 g\u1ea5m t\u00edm Ms: 03056: http://caycanhilg.com/cay-la-gam-tim/\nXem t\u1ea5t c\u1ea3 c\u00e2y l\u00e1 g\u1ea5m t\u00edm t\u1ea1i:http://caycanhilg.com/category/tat-ca-cay-canh-2/cay-la-gam-all/\nHOTLINE: 0938 616 077 -- 0933 482 472\n\nL\u00e1 g\u1ea5m m\u00e0u t\u00edm Ms: 03056\n\nC\u00e2y l\u00e1 g\u1ea5m t\u00edm hay c\u00f2n g\u1ecdi l\u00e0 c\u00e2y t\u00eda t\u00f4 c\u1ea3nh c\u00f3 t\u00ean khoa h\u1ecdc l\u00e0 Solenostemon scutellarioides.

It is very similar to the more widespread Brown-headed Barbet (or Large Green Barbet) (Megalaima zeylanica) but this species has a distinctive supercilium and a broad white cheek stripe below the eye and is endemic to the forest areas of the Western Ghats and adjoining hills. The Brown-headed Barbet has an orange eye-ring but the calls are very similar and the two species occur together in some of the drier forests to the east of the Western Ghats. Like all other Asian barbets they are mainly frugivorous although they may sometimes eat insects and they use their bills to excavate nest cavities in trees. read more...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-cheeked_Barbet\n\nThis video was taken at Kerala,\nIndia - Nikon d90.

The early universe was smaller, hotter, and denser.  In fact in the universe soon after the big bang, matter was too hot to exist in the normal, neutral form.  Atoms and molecules did not exist, and even after this period, the only elements that could exist were hydrogen and the helium created in cosmic nucleosynthesis by the universe itself plus trace amounts of lithium and beryllium.  Thus in the very early universe, there were essentially no heavy elements, so no possibility to form planets, and no possibility of carbon chemistry.  The first stars formed a few hundred million years after the big bang.  The time is still uncertain, and this epoch has not yet been directly observed by astronomers.  However, as soon as the first stars and galaxies formed, heavy elements began to be produced in the cycle of star birth and death: fusion in the cores of massive stars, ejection of the elements in supernovae, and winds from massive stars into the interstellar medium where they subsequently could be part of a next generation of stars.  Thus over cosmic time, the heavy element abundance in the universe has steadily increased, and in that sense life can become more likely as time progresses.  But not all parts of the universe are created equal.  Elliptical galaxies form early, have relatively low rates of star formation, and low heavy element abundances whereas spiral galaxies have active star formation and higher heavy element abundances.  So we might imagine that spiral galaxies are more likely galactic sites for life to occur.", "title": "Teach Astronomy - Cosmic Evolution and Life", "publishedDate": "2010-07-09T16:00:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "8wsgZ6G5b0E", "description": "", "title": "WildBoyz -

Service is best known for his poems \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" and \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\", from his first book, Songs of a Sourdough (1907; also published as The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses). \"These humorous tales in verse were considered doggerel by the literary set, yet remain extremely popular to this day.\" Robert W. Service was born in Preston, Lancashire, England, the first of ten children. His father, also Robert Service, was a banker from Kilwinning, Scotland, who had been transferred to England. At five years old Robert W. Service went to live in Kilwinning with his three maiden aunts and his paternal grandfather, who was the town's postmaster. There he is said to have composed his first verse, a grace, on his sixth birthday: \"God bless the cakes and bless the jam; Bless the cheese and the cold boiled ham; Bless the scones Aunt Jeannie makes, And save us all from bellyaches. Amen\"\n\nIn 1913, Service arrived in Paris, where he would live for the next 15 years. He settled in the Latin Quarter, posing as a painter. In June 1913, he married Parisienne Germaine Bourgoin, daughter of a distillery owner, and they purchased a summer home at Lancieux, C\u00f4tes-d'Armor, in the Brittany region of France. Thirteen years younger than her husband, Germaine Service lived 31 years following his death, dying at age 102 in 1989. Robert Service was 41 when World War I broke out; he enlisted, but was turned down \"due to varicose veins.\" He briefly covered the war for the Toronto Star (from December 11, 1915 through January 29, 1916), but \"was arrested and nearly executed in an outbreak of spy hysteria in Dunkirk.\" -- then \"worked as a stretcher bearer and ambulance driver with the Ambulance Corps of the American Red Cross, until his health broke.\" Convalescing in Paris, he wrote a new book of mainly war poetry, Rhymes of a Red Cross Man, in 1916. The book was dedicated to the memory of Service's \"brother, Lieutenant Albert Service, Canadian Infantry, Killed in Action, France, August 1916.\"\n\nWith the end of the war, Service  settled down to being a rich man in Paris.... During the day he would promenade in the best suits, with a monocle. At night he went out in old clothes with the company of his doorman, a retired policeman, to visit the lowest dives of the city.. During his time in Paris he was reputedly the wealthiest author living in the city, yet was known to dress as a working man and walk the streets, blending in and observing everything around him. Those experiences would be used in his next book of poetry, Ballads of a Bohemian (1921), The poems are given in the persona of an American poet in Paris who serves as an ambulance driver and an infantryman in the war. The verses are separated by diary entries over a period of four years.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "title": "Robert W.

In this study, we have significantly improved the intelligibility of dysarthric vowels of one speaker from 48% to 54%, as evaluated by a vowel identification task using 64 CVC stimuli judged by 24 listeners. Improvement was obtained by transforming the vowels of a speaker with dysarthria to more closely match the vowel space of a non-dysarthric (target) speaker. The optimal mapping feature set, from a list of 21 candidate feature sets, proved to be one utilizing vowel duration and F1--F3 stable points, which were calculated using shape-constrained isotonic regression.

The goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is still one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a dark-gray/olive/brown carp native to east Asia (first domesticated in China) that was introduced to Europe in the late 17th century. The mutation that gave rise to the goldfish is also known from other cyprinid species, such as common carp and tench. Selective breeding over centuries has produced several color variations, some of them far removed from the \"golden\" color of the originally domesticated fish. There are also different body shapes, fin and eye configurations. Some extreme versions of the goldfish do need to be kept in an aquarium\u2014they are much less hardy than varieties closer to the \"wild\" original. However, some variations are hardier, such as the Shubunkin. The main varieties are Common Goldfish, Black Moor, Bubble Eye, Celestial Eye Goldfish, Comet-Tailed Goldfish, Fantail, Lionhead, Oranda, Pearlscale, Pompoms, Ryukin, Shubunkins, Demekin, Ranchu, Panda Moor & Veiltail. Ours are somewhere between Common and Fantail -- with large \"forked\" tails, flowing fins and an array of various colors. Goldfish do a great job cleaning up a tank but they produce a high level of PH so you need either a really good filter and / or constant water changes -- especially if you're going to have these in a tank.\n\nConvict Chichlids (Pond Sized)\nThe Convict cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) is a species of fish from the family Cichlidae, native to Central America, also known as the zebra cichlid. Convict cichlids are popular aquarium fish and have also been the subject of numerous studies on fish behaviour. In natural habitats, the species feeds on crustaceans, small fish, insects, various worms, plants and algae. In 2007, the species was moved from the genus Archocentrus to a new genus, Amatitlania based on a study of Archocentus species by Juan Schmitter-Soto. However, a 2008 study led by Oldrich Rican has suggested that all the species in Cryptoheros and Amatitlania, including Amatitlania nigrofasciata, should be moved into the genus Hypsophrys. A number of synonyms exist for this species including: Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, Cryptoheros nigrofasciatus and Heros nigrofasciatus. Convict cichlids are endemic to the lakes and streams of Central America. In particular, the species occurs along the eastern coast of Central America from Guatemala to Costa Rica, and on the western coast from Honduras to Panama. Convict cichlids prefer moving water, and are most frequently found in habitats with cover in the form of rocks or sunken branches. Convict cichlids are relatively tolerant of cool water, an ability which has allowed the species to colonise volcanic lakes at elevations of 1500 m (4920 feet). At four natural habitats of the convict cichlid in Costa Rica, the pH was found to range from 6.6 - 7.8, while alkalinity ranged from 63 to 77 ppm CaCO3. The daily water temperature ranged from 26-29 \u00b0C (79-84 \u00b0F). The species also occurs outside its natural range in Australia: in the warm effluent of power stations in Victoria, and in tropical Queensland. In addition to Australia, the species has been introduced to R\u00e9union, Japan, Mexico, and the USA. Convict cichlids are easily maintained and bred in aquariums. The aquarium should be decorated to mimic the natural environment and should include rocks and artificial caves for breeding. The species is an unfussy omnivore and most types of prepared fish foods are readily accepted. The species will also consume aquarium plants. Convict Cichlids are aggressively territorial during breeding and pairs are best kept alone in suitably sized aquariums. It has been suggested that brood care is reduced in aquarium strains. Due to the tendency of the species to dig, external filtration is recommended over undergravel filter systems. The relatively small size of this species, along with ease of keeping and breeding, make the convict an ideal cichlid for beginners and advanced aquarists alike interested in observing pair bonds and brood care in the aquarium. In very large environments, these fish tend to grow rather large, their body and fin structures become more elaborate and their gray-ish color turns into more of a neon purplish-blue. When understanding the psychology of these fish, they can be made to co-exist with things such as guppies, sword tails and other fish that they would normally hunt down and kill. Doing this is not recommended unless you already know what the hell you're doing :)", "title": "Pondscape.us - Cell Phone Cam - Pumpkin Kitty & Fish Stock [02]", "publishedDate": "2008-12-24T01:51:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "8x8SObB1lRI", "description": "Official Lyric Video for my song \"Smile That Smile\".\n\nClick here to buy the single on iTunes - http://smarturl.it/SmileThatSmile\n\nFollow me on Twitter: http://smarturl.it/wbtwitter\nLike me on Facebook: http://smarturl.it/wbfacebook\nOfficial Website: http://smarturl.it/WBWebsite", "title": "Weston Burt - Smile That Smile (Lyric Video)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-29T21:41:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "8x8XtduuCFE", "description": "old", "title": "milksop", "publishedDate": "2012-06-21T18:41:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8x95LQuEXWU", "description": "Mariachi Margarita is a flexible sized Mariachi band of authentic professional musicians specialising in traditional Mexican popular music, and Latin American music in General.

This is the build order that IdrA uses in his Zerg versus Zerg (ZvZ) games most of the time. It's a very save build order.\n\n\u25b6  The written version of the build order: http://lowkotv.com/project/starcraft-ii-idra-zerg-vs-zerg-build-order/\n\nGreg \"IdrA\" Fields is a professional StarCraft II, and former Brood War player from the United States of America who predominantly played as Terran in Brood War but switched to Zerg for StarCraft II and is currently playing for the team Evil Geniuses.\n\nIdrA is known for his macro abilities and an excellent grasp of fundamentals and mechanics. The \"IdrA Build\" is so-called because IdrA rarely deviated from this build during the beta. Such pertinacity is exemplary of his play style, which has occasionally proven to be somewhat vulnerable to unconventional or unexpected enemy tactics. His standard play and strength in the late game has caused IdrA to become the target of many cheeses and early-game all-ins.\n\nDespite garnering much respect from both fans and players alike for his abilities, IdrA has gained considerable notoriety for his displays of poor etiquette both during ladder and online tournament matches. His habit of trash talking, vocalizing perceived game imbalance and \"rage quitting\" games have made him a colourful and controversial player within the StarCraft scene.\n\n\u25b6 More information about IdrA | http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/IdrA\n\nEGIdraRC ZvZ Build Order\nZerg vs Zerg Build Order\nProfessional Zerg Build\nStarCraft II Study Zerg\nProfessional Zerg Analysis\n\nMore LowkoTV\n\u25b6 Subscribe | http://www.lowkotv.com/youtube\n\u25b6 Livestream | http://www.twitch.tv/lowkotv\n\u25b6 Website | http://www.lowkotv.com \n\u25b6 Donation Page | http://lowkotv.com/tipjar/\n\nFollow Lowko\n\u25b6 Google+ | http://lowkotv.com/googleplus\n\u25b6 Twitter | http://twitter.com/LowkoTV\n\u25b6 Facebook | http://facebook.com/LowkoTV\n\nI want to thank you all for watching, have an amazing day, don't forget to smile and I'll see you in the next video! \n\nMusic used: Sunlight by Machinimasound.com", "title": "EG.IdrA.RC's Standard Zerg versus Zerg Build Order - ZvZ Build Order: \"StarCraft II Study\"", "publishedDate": "2013-01-14T08:05:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8xAZostySoU", "description": "Subscribe to the ABS-CBN Online channel! - http://bit.ly/ABSCBNOnline\n\nVisit our official website! \nhttp://www.abs-cbn.com\nhttp://www.push.com.ph\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ABSCBNnetwork\n\nTwitter: \nhttps://twitter.com/ABSCBN\nhttps://twitter.com/abscbndotcom\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/abscbnonline", "title": "Sundays Best: BENCH 'The Naked Truth'", "publishedDate": "2014-11-15T18:23:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "8xAhxUPIZfs", "description": "~ OPEN~ I picked up this box at a thrift store and made it look pretty.

The commonly used name Philodendron selloum is a synonym (Mayo 1991). This plant is native to South America, namely to Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, and Paraguay but is also cultivated as a landscape plant in the gulf coast and east coast of the United States, such as in Florida. This plant is also cultivated as a landscape plant in tropical Asian countries such as the Philippines. Heinrich Wilhelm Schott (1794--1865), one of the earliest botanists who studied the Araceae family, did extensive studies of Philodendrons. The names Philodendron bipinnatifidum and Philodendron selloum were accepted as two separate species in the past. However, recent studies focused on the sexual characteristics suggest that they are multiform of the same species. Botanist Simon Mayo documented that these were names of the same plant species that exhibited slight anatomical differences. Since the name Philodendron bipinnatifidum was the first of the two to be published in the literatures, it was accepted as the scientific name. Species within the genus Philodendron are poisonous to vertebrates, but vary in their toxicity levels. They contain calcium oxalate crystals in raphid bundles, which are poisonous and irritating. P. bipinnatifidum sap may cause skin irritation. Chewing and/or ingesting parts of the plant may result in severe swelling and compromised respiratory functions. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philodendron_bipinnatifidum \n\nWhen philodendrons are ready to reproduce they will produce an inflorescence which consists of a leaf-like hood called a spathe within which is enclosed a tube-like structure called a spadix. Depending on the species of philodendron, a single inflorescence can be produced or a cluster of up to 11 inflorescences can be produced at a single time on short peduncles.\n\nPhilodendron can be shrubs, trees or climbers, with glossy, leathery, evergreen, simple to pinnately divided leaves, and tiny flowers borne within arum-like white, green or reddish spathes. P. bipinnatifidum is an evergreen shrub with long-stalked leaves to 1m in length, pinnately divided into narrow, undulate, dark green lobes.

It first appeared in 1842 in Browning's Dramatic Lyrics.[1]\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Last_Duchess\nThe poem is written in 28 rhymed couplets of iambic pentameter.\n\nThe poem is preceded by the word Ferrara:, indicating that the speaker is most likely Alfonso II d'Este, the fifth Duke of Ferrara (1533--1598) who, at the age of 25, married Lucrezia di Cosimo de' Medici, 14-year-old daughter of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Eleonora di Toledo.\n\nLucrezia was not well educated, and the Medicis' status could be termed \"nouveau riche\" in comparison with that of the venerable and distinguished Este family. The Duke's remark regarding his gift of a \"nine-hundred-years-old name\" clearly indicates that he considered his bride beneath him socially. She came, however, with a sizeable dowry. The couple married in 1558. He then abandoned her for two years before she died on April 21, 1561, at age 17. There was a strong suspicion of poisoning. The Duke then sought the hand of Barbara, eighth daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I and Anna of Bohemia and Hungary and the sister of the Count of Tyrol, Ferdinand II.[2] The count was in charge of arranging the marriage; the chief of his entourage, Nikolaus Madruz, a native of Innsbruck, was his courier. Madruz is presumably the silent listener in the poem.\n\nThe other characters named in the poem, painter Fr\u00e0 Pandolf and sculptor Claus of Innsbruck, are fictional.\n\n\nvideo produced and copyright to Robert Nichol 2013", "title": "My Last Duchess by Robert Browning", "publishedDate": "2013-01-24T22:49:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "8xIcmhFLE8Q", "description": "\u00abThe Jill & Tony Curtis story\u00bb\nOne day, while surfing on the Net, Jill felt deeply disturbed by a world of so much cruelty that she decided to make it her workhorse effort. Each year, atrocities, tortures and lingering death are what can be expected by more than 100,000 horses doomed to die in slaughterhouses. There, with no consideration for their loyalty and services rendered to their owners, this most beautiful human conquest has often no choice but to be cut up alive.\nInspired by Oprah Winfreys words \u00b2make good use of your life\u00b2, Jills fight for dignity was the new direction she decided to take for her life. With the support of her husband Tony Curtis, the famous American cinema actor, she created the Shiloh Horse Rescue and Sanctuary, a place of peace for 400 horses in need she saved from that horrible experience. Comfort care, rehabilitation and restoring confidence are some of the sustaining care they receive at the sanctuary. But despite her efforts, many more horses will not be able to escape from affright, just like this foal which has not eaten nor drank water for three days, she cannot save them all.\nThe couple fame served as a leverage effect in their search for support among members of the Senate to proscribe those practices and pass the bill H.R.503/S.311 that would officially ban american horse slaughtering and their transportation to slaughterhouses in other countries like Canada et Mexico.\nThe cause is still pending. Meanwhile, thousands and thousands horses are betrayed by the ones in whom they placed their confidence\nhttp://www.collectionpassionchevaux.com\n\nLe Combat pour la dignit\u00e9\nSur un site internet, Jill d\u00e9couvre un univers de cruaut\u00e9 insoup\u00e7onn\u00e9 qui latteindra \u00e0 un tel point quelle en fera son cheval de bataille.

Avec le soutien de son mari Tony Curtis, c\u00e9l\u00e8bre acteur am\u00e9ricain, elle cr\u00e9era le refuge nomm\u00e9 Shiloh, lieu de paix pour les 400 chevaux quelle a \u00e9pargn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce jour de cette triste fin.

Aparecieron por primera vez durante el Eoceno, unos 55 millones de a\u00f1os.\n\nEn sentido estricto, un cocodrilo es cualquier especie que pertenece a la familia Crocodylidae (a veces clasificada como la subfamilia Crocodylinae).

O \u00fanico predador natural do crocodilo \u00e9 o tigre que raramente se alimenta dele em determinadas \u00e1reas da \u00c1sia.\n\nO maior r\u00e9ptil hoje na face da terra \u00e9 o crocodilo-de-\u00e1gua-salgada encontrado no norte da Austr\u00e1lia e ilhas do sudeste da \u00c1sia.\n\nOs crocodilos, depois das aves, s\u00e3o os parentes mais pr\u00f3ximos dos dinossauros atualmente. Tanto dinossaurios quanto crocodilos evolu\u00edram dos tecodontes, assim como as aves podem ter evolu\u00eddo dos dinossauros. Isso faz com que os crocodilos sejam mais aparentados com as aves do que com todos os outros r\u00e9pteis atuais. Surgiram h\u00e1 248 milh\u00f5es de anos aproximadamente, tendo convivido com dinossauros. Apesar de n\u00e3o terem a mesma mobilidade que seus antepassados, j\u00e1 foram registados crocodilos que podem correr nas margens de rios a uma velocidade de at\u00e9 16 km/h.\n\n\n\n\n\u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u044b\n\n\u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0301\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0301\u043b\u044b (\u043b\u0430\u0442.

Now, for the first time in Iowa and quite possibly the nation, there's an innovative research center with no walls and no boundaries Created in the Corridor.Thousands of children with mental, emotional or behavioral challenges already get help from Tanager Place. We serve, yearly, over 4,000 kids and families, says George Estle, Tanager's CEO since 1982.Tanager's outpatient and inpatient programs are located on its main campus in southwest Cedar Rapids and many of its services are based in schools. But Tanager sees a need to provide more than just treatment.Explains Estle, If were truly going to be innovation driven, if were going to be true to our mission, that has to be fundamentally driven by data. We have to know what were doing and why and what works and what doesnt work. So Estle and his staff are doing something that hasn't been done before; partnering with five Corridor Colleges and Universities for a Research Center embedded in a practice setting.As one example, the University of Iowa is researching a form a play therapy for children and their parents. Volker Thomas, Associate Professor and Director of the Couple and Family Therapy Program at the College of Education says parents can learn as much as the researchers. The children respond in such wonderful ways that the parents quite often say, Wow, how did that work? I wish I could do that too. And they say, Well, well teach you how to do it.At the same time Melinda Green,  Associate Professor of Psychology at Cornell College, is looking at biometric markers of Bulimia nervosa. The number one cause of death for women with bulimia are sudden cardiac arrhythmia, says Green. So she is studying a nerve dysfunction that causes these cardiac events. And Green has been able to grow the number of participants thanks to funding from, and access to, Tanager Place. Again, it's about conducting research where people live with no limits on the areas of exploration. Since we want to do it in the real world rather than at the lab at the University, says Professor Thomas, thats why it is so important for us to come to places like Tanager and work with them.Estle says the research possibilities are endless.  An open ended approach like this, I dont know of anything like it in the country.  Tanager received a $130,000 gift from longtime advocate Marty Andreas who helped jump start the center. And the stakeholders believe its findings have the potential to impact the nation.Participating research partners include the University of Iowa, Mount Mercy University, St. Ambrose University, Cornell College and Coe College.

The palace was built in 1921 at the orders of His Highness Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, the Maharaja of Mysore for the exclusive stay of the then Viceroy of India.[1] Built on a raising ground, the palace was fashioned on the lines of the St. Paul's Cathedral in London and is one of the imposing structures of the Mysore city.[2][3][4][5]\nThe palace painted in pure white colour is strikingly elegant. It was converted into a heritage hotel in 1974.[6] It is now run as an elite hotel of the Ashok Group of the India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) under the Government of India.

Next up for the rock legend is a September 27-28 engagement at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Brooklyn, New York, in conjunction with a concert series celebrating the 50th anniversary of Robert Plant\u2019s new label, Nonesuch Records.  The trek also will stop in Toronto, Chicago and Denver before wrapping up on October 7 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles.\n\nLos Angeles Times update 11/12/2014: Robert Plant and Virgin Atlantic founder Richard Branson have gone public separately to disavow media reports circulating this week that Branson had offered Led Zeppelin\u2019s surviving members anywhere from $400 million to $750 million to reunite, and that Plant had torn up the offer in Branson\u2019s face. As much as I love [Led Zeppelin], there is absolutely no truth to the story. - Richard Branson\n\n\u201cRobert Plant has not been in receipt of any offers in recent months with any organization or promoters regarding future Led Zep live shows,\u201d Plant said Wednesday through a spokesman. \u201cRobert Plant has neither met or communicated with Richard Branson in the last 50 years, so it was with great surprise to see this reported in the press.\u201d\n\nBranson took to his personal blog to confirm from his end that no such offer had been presented, although it had been reported as fact by the British tabloid the Mirror and picked up by numerous other outlets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been left dazed and confused by a story doing the rounds this week about us apparently offering Led Zeppelin \u00a3500 million to reform and carry out a tour,\u201d Branson wrote. \u201cAs much as I love the band, there is absolutely no truth to the story.\n\n\u201cThere were even claims that Virgin Atlantic was about to rename one of our planes and include a stairway to heaven in honour of the band,\u201d  Branson continued. \u201cHowever nice an idea, this is also completely untrue. After a week of seeing worryingly inaccurate reports in various publications regarding Virgin, it was sad but not particularly surprising to see yet another fabricated story.\u201d\n\nPlant is currently touring with his latest band, the Sensational Space Shifters, which released an album, \u201cLullaby\u2026and the Ceaseless Roar,\u201d in September to largely laudatory reviews.\n\nBranson went on to note that in the wake of the reports, he had connected with Plant. \u201cI spoke to Robert Plant about the story, which he also confirmed is complete rubbish from his side too,\u201d Branson added. \u201cRobert told me he is very proud of his history and the band\u2019s past, and has always had great respect and love for his work throughout his career. However, he really believes he must move on with his life and career today.\u201d\n\nPlant also included a note to assure fans he is not interested in distancing himself from his work with Zeppelin. \u201cHe is excited and proud of their most recent remastered releases,\u201d Plant\u2019s statement read, \u201cand disappointed with any confusion this current fabricated story may bring.\u201d\n\nWrote Branson: \";Making up this story is very disrespectful to how wonderful his solo career with the Sensational Space Shifters is going\u2026.\n\n\u201cFellow band members Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones also have many exciting projects in the works and should be respected in their own right,\u201d Branson wrote. \u201cI\u2019m proud of how so many artists from my generation, whether it is Led Zeppelin, Mike Oldfield or Peter Gabriel, are still being so creative and inventive. They have all moved on into exciting new phases, while still celebrating their incredible pasts.\u201d", "title": "Robert Plant - Rainbow on The Tonight Show 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-27T08:25:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8x_Jpfm3kCM", "description": "Land Cruiser rescues Hummer H2 in Dubai Desert", "title": "Arabian Offroad Academy - Land Cruiser rescues Hummer H2", "publishedDate": "2009-01-23T22:59:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8x_NmcIFb0o", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "Pokemon tcg code give away part 4", "publishedDate": "2014-03-28T14:48:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "8x_SiyEmWU0", "description": "", "title": "The Beatles - Yesterday (cover)", "publishedDate": "2011-01-08T23:11:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "8x_WB6bGOog", "description": "I didn't make the lyrics, I just sang it.", "title": "Panic At The Discount", "publishedDate": "2014-04-17T06:25:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8x_doFQWBNU", "description": "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim OST - The Gathering Storm", "title": "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim OST - The Gathering Storm", "publishedDate": "2012-01-04T09:41:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8x_kcWzU9W4", "description": "http://www.bogley.com/forum/showthread.php?56721-WeeRide-Co-Pilot-bicycle-tandem-attachment\nBuy the WeeRide CoPilot here:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I4255G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bogloutdcomm-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B000I4255G", "title": "WeeRide CoPilot Review with GoPro", "publishedDate": "2011-07-03T20:21:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "8xa8Kg2ozpg", "description": "Website: http://cawkav.com | FB: http://tiny.cc/CawF\nTwitter: http://tiny.cc/CawT\n\n\n[Video]\nSo here's another Rube Goldberg Machine video!

Although we never used the Argo for this, we did test it once in a pond near the cabin and it works great. The Argo includes a Bilge Pump that will pump out any water that should get inside.\n\nThe condition of this Argo is as close to new as you will find. We are selling the Argo since we don't use it often enough and have another machine we can use to get into the cabin. We have averaged just over 10 hours a year. The Argo runs perfectly, starts right up without a problem and works flawlessly. \n\nThis would make a great hunting vehicle, or if you were in need of a snow cat, this would be perfect. It has a trailer hitch to pull behind sleds or trailers.\n\nHighlights:\n18\" Factory Super Snow Tracks with 6\" extenders to a total of 24\" tracks on each side for Colorado powder -- installed by dealer. Each track has over 1,900 sq inches of contact with the snow for a total of 3,800 sq inches of flotation.\nWinch\nBilge pump\nWindshield \nTrailer hitch\n18hp/570cc Engine -- twin cylinder\nSeating for 5\nHigh and Low range\nAmphibious\n2 sets of tires  -- one set of 6 for tracks and one set of 6 for dirt -- both sets are like new with full tread\nAlways serviced per manufacturer's recommended schedule\nArgo Cover \nAlways covered or garaged.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to contact me via e-mail. cc-w3@msn.com", "title": "For Sale - 2004 Argo Bigfoot 6X6 Amphibious ATV-UTV", "publishedDate": "2013-02-21T20:06:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8xkQoH8QbVs", "description": "Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\nSubscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\nLike us on FACEBOOK: http://goo.gl/dHs73\nRope (1948) Official Trailer #1 - Alfred Hitchcock Movie\n\n\nTwo young men strangle their \"inferior\" classmate, hide his body in their apartment, and invite his friends and family to a dinner party as a means to challenge the \"perfection\" of their crime.\n\n\"classic movie\" movieclips movieclipstrailers \"movie clips\" movieclipsDOTcom movieclipscomingsoon zefr jslewis\u00a0Rope \"Rope movie\" \"Rope film\" \"Rope trailer\" \"Alfred Hitchcock\" murder classmate professor crime drama thriller \"James Stewart\" \"Cedric Hardwicke\" \"John Dall\"", "title": "Rope (1948) Official Trailer #1 - Alfred Hitchcock Movie", "publishedDate": "2013-11-14T01:09:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "8xkSfGI6CE4", "description": "Just a tiny snippet of the great set that Shabti put on in Portland, Maine last night.
