Son animales de mediano tama\u00f1o, que habitan principalmente en Am\u00e9rica, con un g\u00e9nero en el Sudeste Asi\u00e1tico.\nCaracter\u00edsticas y comportamiento\nSu rasgo caracter\u00edstico principal es el fuerte y f\u00e9tido olor que segregan sus gl\u00e1ndulas anales. Este olor es emitido cuando la mofeta se siente amenazada. Antes de la emanaci\u00f3n, la mofeta adopta una posici\u00f3n corporal distinta seg\u00fan la especie; algunas levantan su cola, mientras que otras especies, levantan las patas traseras, quedando apoyados solamente sobre las delanteras. De todos modos, ante situaciones amenazantes, todas las especies emiten un sonido agudo, que producen tambi\u00e9n cuando se pegan a alguna superficie. Esto les permite protegerse de los depredadores.\nEl pelaje es b\u00e1sicamente de color blanco y negro. Son omn\u00edvoros, pueden alimentarse tanto de insectos, huevos, frutas, mam\u00edferos peque\u00f1os, p\u00e1jaros y miel.\nLas hembras mofetas tienen un per\u00edodo de gestaci\u00f3n de 55 d\u00edas y llegan a parir entre 1 y 10 cr\u00edas. Estas se alimentan de leche materna por aproximadamente 10 semanas.\nH\u00e1bitat\nViven en madrigueras que son cavadas por las hembras y durante el invierno, pasan un per\u00edodo de letargo, el cual no llega a ser una hibernaci\u00f3n completa.\nA veces comparten madrigueras cavadas por otras especies como zorros y mapaches.\nG\u00e9neros y especies\nAnteriormente eran consideradas una subfamilia de los must\u00e9lidos, hasta que un estudio del ADN (Dragoo [1] and Honeycutt, 1997, Journal of Mammalology, 78(2): 426-443), llev\u00f3 a reorganizarlas en dicha familia.

Do you know why girls are hitting puberty at an earlier and earlier age? Angela Sun, sportscaster and former Current TV correspondent, answers these questions by first asking this one: if plastic never goes away, where does it go? An avid diver, surfer, and swimmer, Sun lets her deep love for the ocean lead her into investigating the lasting effects on global ecosystems of one of the best blessings and worst curses to be invented in the modern world.\n\nAfter years of wading through red tape, Sun finally makes it to the famed \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" and puts herself on the front lines as she crashes a convention to secretly interview the people behind plastics manufacturing, and gets her blood tested for BPA after deliberate exposure via a store receipt. In the seven years it took to make the film, Sun met the best of environmental preservationists and the worst of corporations hell-bent on keeping plastic production alive. The result is a film that moves the grassroots and has the audience thinking twice before grabbing a straw to go with a beverage. --Wilda Wong\n\nFilm Screening: \nDigiplex Mission Valley\nNovember 9, 2013 12:30 pm\n\nEncinitas Public Library\nNovember 16, 2013 2:00 pm\n\nBuy Tickets Here!\nhttp://bit.ly/PlasticParadiseMovie\n\nCourtesy of the Pacific Arts Movement \nhttp://www.pac-arts.org | info@sdaff.org | 619.400.5911\nFESTIVAL SCHEDULE: www.pac-arts.org/sdaff\nSUBSCRIBE: http://www.youtube.com/SanDiegoAsianFilm\nLIKE: http://www.facebook.com/SDAsianFilm\nFOLLOW: https://twitter.com/PacArtsMovement\nREAD: http://sdasianfilm.blogspot.com/", "title": "Plastic Paradise: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Trailer", "publishedDate": "2013-10-06T05:32:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "90ddtd8SwKs", "description": "Hey guys, this is a Tutorial on how to play Age of Empires 2 Online.

It's a simpler brilliance. That's what always should be done because one of the major areas of distress or irritation with a hearing aid is with those people who are closest to you. We are living with them most of our life.\n\nIt really helps when the stress comes in from adapting to a hearing aid and having your immediate partners, friends, family cope with your hearing loss.\n\nDirections and Reviews:\nWe are proud to offer residents of Philadelphia, Audubon, Narberth, Jenkintown, Ridley Park PA the best hearing aids and audiology services.

TUCCA is closely associated with the Brazilian Branch of INCTR. \nThis year, the AMCC - INCTR French Branch- is aiming to launch a similar program in Sudan, Morocco, Mali, Congo Brazzaville, and DRC which will also facilitate access to treatment and support the rehabilitation of cured children. \n\nMore information : http://www.inctr.org\nhttp://www.tucca.org.br\nhttp://www.cancer-amcc.org/1-Alliance-Mondial-Contre-le-Cancer-AMCC.html", "title": "Retinoblastoma campaign - English version.mpg", "publishedDate": "2011-01-13T10:44:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "90lNXqqoXyM", "description": "", "title": "Aramb Dasam Granth Hukamnama", "publishedDate": "2014-08-08T01:20:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "90mnlfxR_DM", "description": "Winchcombe music, UK based band, 'Los Critters'.........", "title": "Mexicano - El Marcha de Pancho", "publishedDate": "2010-03-16T21:31:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "90mqdNzoX_o", "description": "\"Woodrow Wilson said it is my job as an institution of higher learning to make a man most unlike his father as possible....What?

The response was tackled by Glenn in TRUE #GlennBeck fashion with a strong reference to #WoodrowWilson #Progressivism #Progressive ideology and the uncanny implementation of boxing students in and conditioning them to fit a mold that society has embraced as worker bees.

Glenn further discusses his admiration for apprenticeships and giving opportunities to actually work in a field around like minded  visionaries such as Steve Jobs being much more beneficial, as opposed to training a field of worker bees as suggested by the initial question. \n\n(All video footage belongs to and is property of The Glenn Beck Program and The Blaze TV Network.

Sentry Turrets are used within Aperture Laboratories to protect restricted areas as well as in the testing of Military Androids and the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\n\nThe Aperture Science Sentry Turret has a single red eye, sleek appearance and predominately white color scheme common to most Aperture Science technology. Sentry Turrets have only been seen in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center acting as guards in Test Chambers and maintenance areas.\n\nSentry Turrets often speak in a child-like, artificial voice similar to GLaDOS and toilets within Aperture Laboratories. They have a strangely polite demeanor, which is in direct contrast with their deadly behavior. They will even forgive Chell for knocking them over. In one scene in Portal 2, a Sentry Turret stuck inside the Aperture Science Pipe Network attempts to get Chell and Wheatley's attention. At Wheatley's encouragement, Chell ignores it, but the Sentry Turret politely says \"thanks anyway.\"\n\nThe Sentry Turrets are armed with dual machine guns, targeted with a visible laser beam. These weapons are normally hidden inside the body, during \"sleep mode.\" When the Sentry Turret is alerted, they will deploy, and fire at any visible target (usually Test Subjects or intruders in the labs). When no target is in range, the Sentry will scan back and forth across the area, and return to sleep mode after several seconds if no further target is found.\n\nAperture-Brand Resolution Pellets, the bullets for a Sentry Turret's guns, are simply dumped into its hollow body, called the Shell Redistribution Chamber; this allows for an unusually large supply of ammunition for such a small device. Aperture-Brand Resolution Pellets are the only type of ammunition that is recommended for use with a Sentry Turret. In addition, bullets are not \"fired\" in the traditional sense. They are propelled, shell and all, with a spring-loaded mechanism called the Projectile Acceleration Cylinder, which is guarded by the Aperture Turret External Barrel. Since the whole bullet is fired, this allows up to 65% more bullet mass per bullet, the extra mass adding to the stopping power of the bullet.\n\nThe Personality Core of the Sentry Turret is located within the outer shell, above the guns. It is fitted with a Fire/No Fire Incident Resolution Chip, presumably to help the Turret distinguish when or when not to fire, an Empathy Generator and an Empathy Suppressor. Apparently, the Empathy Suppressor is of greater influence, as simply standing near a Sentry Turret may cause its Empathy Suppressor to accidentally activate, greatly reducing the Sentry Turret's feelings of empathy toward its foe.\n\nThe consumer version of the Sentry Turret is available in hundreds of different designer patterns and colors, including \"Forest\", \"Desert\", \"Table\", and \"Evening at the Improv.\"\nmore info:\nhttp://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Aperture_Science_Sentry_Turret\n\n\nCopyright\n\u00a9 2010 Valve Corporation.

Nike's new Speed Control texture on the upper gives players the confidence to perform at speed with enhanced friction that combines with a snug and responsive fit -- a hallmark of Mercurial boots. The Speed Control texture wraps around the foot, giving the boot friction when necessary without compromising on the soft touch the player requires. The upper also locks down the foot and prevents unnecessary movement within the boot, while a minimal and soft heel area maximizes comfort and therefore the performance of those wearing them.\n\nNike's innovative All Conditions Control (ACC) technology further aids performance; the special treatment now used on all Nike boots ensures a consistent touch whether playing in wet or dry weather.\n\nThe Mercurial Vapor IX features a unique, lightweight plate, incorporating two different pieces of glass fiber that increase flexibility and responsiveness, providing energy return in the heat of the game. \n\nBoth colorways will be available for pre-order on January 18 and on January 31 at Nike.com and retailers worldwide. \n\n\nNike Mercurial Vapor IX | POLISH\n\nNike Mercurial Vapor IX to ca\u0142kowicie nowy rozdzia\u0142 w \u015bwiecie but\u00f3w pi\u0142karskich.

Typically this is done using a settling tank, allowing gravity to slowly separate the emulsion into distinct product and effluent phases. This solution is appealing because it demands virtually no energy; however, it can be slow depending on the stability of the emulsion, is often batch only, and traditional settling tanks can occupy large amounts of space depending on desired product volumes. Therefore a faster, continuous, low space requirement, low energy alternative for emulsion separation is desired to enhance the results of simple gravity separation.\nIn the designed system, an ePTFE membrane is used to take advantage of interfacial tension between product (organic) and effluent (aqueous) phases within the emulsion, selectively allowing the passage of a large portion of the product phase through the membrane, while leaving the effluent phase and some residual product on the feed side of the ePTFE barrier. Since the organic phase must wet the ePTFE surface and also have a high interfacial tension with water, only a narrow range of substances can be used. In our demonstrative incorporation of the ePTFE phase separator into a metal extraction system, hydrocarbon extraction solvents such as Kerosene can be separated because of their high interfacial tension and ability to wet the surface of the ePTFE. In addition, many organic solvents which posses a high interfacial tension with water separate sufficiently quick while settling as not to warrant a design such as ours necessary.

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Flowers give rise to fruit and seeds. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen.\nIn addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to beautify their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.The transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle. The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal reproductive success. To meet these needs a plant is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of plant hormones and seasonable temperature and photoperiod changes.[10] Many perennial and most biennial plants require vernalization to flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as florigen, which involves a variety of genes, including CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS C and FLOWERING LOCUS T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes.[11]\nThe first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue.[12] Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower.", "title": "H@t Woman & Girl Are Watching Flower Show", "publishedDate": "2014-03-01T15:50:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "91PQP-IYSXY", "description": "http://losbrokeboys.com\n\nDownload \"Psycho Babble\" for FREE on Soundcloud\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ibethatschmidt\n\nProduced by Asaday\nwww.youtube.com/user/ItssTeeJay\n\nFilmed by Bailey Forsten\n\nDirected and Edited By Alexander Schmidt\n\nStock Videos by El Famoso Demon\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/ElFamosoDemon", "title": "Schmidt - Psycho Babble (Music Video)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-19T03:55:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "91Qeda8tan4", "description": "\u00bb Lied : Scorp - Es tut mir leid.", "title": "Ich bin ehrlich wenn ich sage, ich war niemals so verliebt.", "publishedDate": "2010-03-19T09:29:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "91Qghq_jhY4", "description": "Teledysk promuj\u0105cy komiks Duds Hunt.

Starting running at 10 years old Asenate took inspiration and guidance from her family, who have supported her throughout her career and hopes to give that back to her community in a few years.\n \nBoth Asenate and Tavevele want to go back home and coach the young people of Tuvalu and get more active, Tavevele said, \"It's a great sport, and I want others to love it.\"\n \nFor athletes, training on grass is completely different to the track and they hope they will be able to get a running track in Tuvalu in the future so they can get more people involved.\n\nBoth athletes aspire to run national records in their sprinting events, and to make Tuvalu proud.\n \n-----Ends-------\n\nThis story was produced by Matt of The Reporters' Academy, a media production company run by young people, tasked with the mission of telling Oceania London 2012 stories . \n\nThe Reporters' Academy is integrated into the world of media, education and employment, based in two great sporting cities, Manchester and Melbourne, and is officially Inspired by London 2012.", "title": "Tuvalu Athletes Ready for 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-07-10T15:17:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "91RpDcmioe8", "description": "For more, visit http://www.orlandoedc.com.\nOriginally from New York City, this University of Central Florida student had had a lot of preconceived notions about Orlando before moving here.

Property investment. Real estate investments. Investment properties. Buying investment property. Contact Jeff Gitt at 314-757-1031 or jgitt@westwoodnetlease.com\n\nWith the recent increase in the securitization of commercial real estate loans, commercial real estate investment property has become increasingly desirable, particularly investment property that offers a stable return in the form of rental income. If you are considering making a property investment that yields rental income, you should begin by evaluating your options based on the types of lease agreements that govern commercial investment property: gross leases and net leases.\n\nThe Value of Net Leases\n\nA gross lease is an agreement in which the property owner pays for property taxes, building insurance, and property maintenance using rental income. A net lease is an agreement in which the property owner transfers one or more of these expenses to the tenant, and thus receives a higher net amount of rental income. There are three types of net leases: a single net (N) lease, a double net (NN) lease, and a triple net (NNN) lease.\n\nSingle Net Lease -- In a single net lease, the tenant pays property taxes in addition to base expenses such as rent and utilities.  \n\nDouble Net Lease -- In a double net lease, the tenant pays property taxes and building insurance in addition to base expenses. \n\nTriple Net Lease -- In a triple net lease, the tenant pays property taxes, building insurance, and property maintenance plus base expenses.\n\nInvestment properties that are subject to a triple net lease typically experience the lowest capitalization rate, which is the ratio between a property's annual net operating income and its price, of all lease properties. With that said, acquiring real estate investment property that is subject to a single net lease or double net lease is not without merit. \n\nA single net or double net property may generate a lower net income than a comparable triple net property, but finding a tenant that has the financial resources to handle a triple net lease can be challenging. Because so much property expense is deferred to the tenant, only companies that have a high net operating income and an excellent credit rating are considered viable occupants.       \n\nIn an ideal transaction, a property is acquired with suitable tenant already signed to a long-term lease\u2014an arrangement that negates the risk of the property sitting idle while a tenant is found. But even when a property is occupied under favorable conditions, an experienced triple net lease broker should still analyze the inherent risks of investing in the property before an acquisition is made.\n\nRisk assessment frequently begins with examining the property's projected cap rate, specifically its \"going in\" cap rate and \"average\" cap rate, which are the ratio of the first year of net operating income to the property's purchase price.\n\nThe tenant's credit rating is also examined. If the tenant is a public company, its rating from Standard & Poor's will be used as a reference point. \n\nA company's credit rating is a good barometer of its ability to afford the lease, but an experienced broker will advise the investor to consider other aspects of the tenant's financial picture as well, such as its debt to equity ratio, stability of management, number of stores, and the financial outlook for its sector. In addition to assessing the value of the tenant, the investor must assess the value of the property. \n\nIs the property in good condition? Is it designed for a specific company or kind of business, or could it be leased to various businesses? Is the current lease rate above market, below market, or average? Do legalities such as encroachments and easements limit how the real estate could be used in the future? These are some of the questions that a triple net lease broker will help the investor answer about a property before an acquisition is made.\n\nIf you are considering making a commercial property investment, now is a good time to explore the opportunity further. The securitization of commercial real estate loans is slowly increasing, and targeting a lucrative triple net lease property can increase the your chances of securing favorable financing. To learn more about the benefits of triple net investment property and the ways to acquire it, contact an investment property broker today to schedule a free consultation.   \n\n\n\nRetaining A Broker\n\nRetaining a broker that specializes in real estate investment property is essential for making the best investment. A broker has access to a database of extensive on-market and off-market properties\u2014a resource that increases the investor's chance of finding the best property. The broker will also advise the investor on the best way to acquire the property. For example, acquiring it in a 1031 exchange, which defers most taxes, may be better than buying it outright.", "title": "Real Estate Investment Properties and Property Investment For Sale", "publishedDate": "2013-05-07T06:42:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "91TgDAAaom0", "description": "Four junior chefs in Alice Springs made it to the finals of this year's Bush Food recipe competiiton with a recipe for quandong truffles and wattleseed milkshakes. they explain how they did it in this video from Alice Online (http://www.aliceonline.com.au)", "title": "Quandong truffles", "publishedDate": "2011-09-28T01:32:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "91U4gzrsIbk", "description": "Aqu\u00ed presento una migraci\u00f3n de mi colonia de Hormigas Myrmelachista chilensis a su nuevo hogar.

They first formed in 1990, releasing the More Than Ever demo tape in 1991. This was quickly followed in 1992 by a split EP with Crisis of Faith and the Life Goes On EP that same year. The band was soon renowned as one of the heaviest in hardcore, drawing ire from some purists for incorporating metal riffage into their sound. Their rise in popularity paralleled that of other vegan straight edge bands such as Earth Crisis and hardline bands like Vegan Reich and Raid. While bands that adhered to Hardline were totally opposed to abortion, Chokehold was vehemently pro-choice. While Chokehold were atheists and radicals with a strongly anarchist streak to their politics, many of the hardline bands were by contrast conservative (expressing belief in a higher power, homophobia, support for the death penalty and prisons and other conservative views).\nIn 1993 Chokehold released the Prison of Hope LP through American label Conquer the World Records (CTW). They released their next record, 1994s Instilled EP, on Philadelphia, PAs Bloodlink Records. This EP featured some of their most powerful and political material to date, notably the anti-religious song Anchor, the anti-homophobia song Mindset, and Burning Bridges, with its hard-hitting lyrics: The corporations are aware where the average person is not, violence against one meat eater is not going to liberate a million animals. You must take action against those who run the industry, not the ones lied to. And to take them down we must use as much fucking violence as they do. Animal liberation, Earth liberation, Human liberation, will only come through education.\nThey followed this in the next year with their second LP, Content With Dying. This album contained by far their most controversial song yet: Not a Solution was possibly the most militantly pro-choice hardcore song since Born Againsts Mary and Child. The liner notes to the song state, to all the militant pro-lifers who couldnt spell life let alone understand it, we salute you with a middle finger. The song is directed at those who identify as pro-lifers, including many vegan straight edge bands at the time, most notably Abnegation. This song in particularly created a huge rift in the vegan straight edge scene. When Chokehold played a show with Abnegation that year, the two bands spent their sets screaming at each other, and they and their fans nearly came to blows. This refusal to back down in the face of significant opposition even within their own subculture typifies Chokeholds uncompromising stance in general.\nThey signed in 1996 to Germanys Mad Mob Records, who unbeknownst to them already had a bad reputation in the European hardcore scene. They recorded four new songs to be released as a split CD with Feeding the Fire, but after a European tour in 1996 the band decided to break up. They played their last show in March at the New Bedford Fest in Massachusetts. These four songs were released as a self-titled EP on Jawk Records the following year.

All you have to do is layer your bed with white bedding to achieve that clean and crisp look. With our extensive bedding assortment, you can build a collection of white bedding that is suitable for all seasons.\n\nThe wonderful thing about white beds is that they are easy to style. Introduce a new element such as a duvet, a quilt or a sham to refresh the overall bedroom decor. White beds are very versatile as with a few different elements you can change the whole look. With simple accents, the bed can take on a clean and classic look or you can add a romantic touch to it with ruffled shams and heirloom linens. We've included all types of white bedding in our collection so you can choose any look you wish.\n\nWhen it comes to bedding, fabric is an important factor. Percale is a great choice as it is soft while sateen offers a sophisticated tailored look. Linen is another option that is perfect for summers. For adding textural interest, choose matelasse fabric. Ruched voile fabric infuses a white bed with romantic appeal. Our rustic luxe linen silk bedding is also a great choice for designing a beautiful bed.\n\nTo make a picture-perfect white bed, start with good-quality sheets and then layer on a duvet or a comforter. Next, add a quilt over the duvet. You can tuck it in with the bedding or simply fold it at the foot of the bed. A second duvet is great for adding extra loft. All-white beds are all about details so shams are an important element of the bed. Coordinating shams add a tailored look while shams in contrasting fabrics are great for adding visual appeal. Spray the bedding with lavender-infused water to get rid of the wrinkles.\n\nWe strongly believe beds should provide comfort and renewal.

Leister Laser Plastic Welding offers laser systems for frequently used techniques to laser weld thermoplastics including contour welding, GLOBO welding, and mask welding. In contour welding, two pieces of plastic are clamped together and a laser beam is guided sequentially along a predetermined welding pattern. Our mask welding technique uses a chrome mask to protect areas that should remain untouched when a curtain of laser light is moved across the part -- fast and efficient! With GLOBO welding, a laser beam is focused at a point on the joining plane via an air bearing, freely rotating glass sphere which also serves as a mechanical clamping tool. This process allows welding 3D patterns or 2D patterns that are difficult or impossible to clamp.

He proved a number of extremely surprising results about the limitations of mathematics. Perhaps the most significant of these is his celebrated incompleteness theorem, which tells us that there are mathematical \"blind spots\": parts of mathematics that traditional methods of proof cannot access. These results are thought by many to have far-reaching consequences for computing and for our understanding of the nature of the human mind. G\u00f6del's results have thus been the subject of a great deal of popular attention. Indeed, few other results in the history of mathematics have had such an impact outside of mathematics.

They perform their original song \"Holy Unholy.\" http://www.thehellostrangers.com\nMore about The Hello Strangers:\nWhat does Austin-influenced, rural-Pennsylvanian, indie sister-folk sound like? Verbosity aside, it sounds uniquely like The Hello Strangers, a sister duo whose haunting harmonies and original, wittingly noir songwriting style are the backbone of their sound. \n\nThe Hello Strangers were born out of the Austin, Texas music scene in 2006 when sisters Larissa Chace Smith and Brechyn Chace wrote their first song together, entitled \"Pregnant in Jail.\" Based on true events, it was a preamble to a string of original tunes the pair crafted in a little cottage off South Congress Avenue. Soon, however, the mountains of Pennsylvania beckoned the girls back north, and so they packed up their lives, dogs, and Larissa's husband and returned to their two-stoplight hometown. \n\nThe move has since proven to be a boon for the duo. The sisters have created a catalogue of original music with nods to American folk traditions, modern indie rock, Texas country-folk, and roots rock, all tied together with lilting harmonies that only sisters can create. Timeless imagery and fables are at the core of each song, from tales of a boggy creek bottom where a murdered man sleeps, to a Texas roadhouse with bawdy dancers and clinking beer bottles, to more poignant reflections on the loss of winter or a man gone wrong. \n\nCurrently, the sisters are backed by long-time bassist Dave Holzwarth, with Spencer Pheil on guitar and Trent Renshaw on drums. \n\nThe Hello Strangers recently won the AirPlay Direct \"Win An Americana Record Deal Contest\" and will have the honor of working with IMI Music in Nashville, Tennessee on their forthcoming album. \n\nNo Surf Music calls them \"perhaps the most exciting prospects on the Americana scene today, with dark, perfectly crafted lyrics expressed through a pair of harmonious voices literally born to sing together and coated in folk-inspired music bolstered by a fresh, modern attitude.\"", "title": "\"Holy Unholy\" by The Hello Strangers", "publishedDate": "2013-04-18T00:01:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "92IUxigDhc4", "description": "Is a dental implant going to hurt?

And when you press Daisy's back twice, the toy enters Cuddle Mode so that you can hold Daisy in your arms and cuddle.", "title": "FurReal Friends Daisy Plays-With-Me Kitty from Hasbro", "publishedDate": "2013-07-26T16:46:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "92T32Hpjw60", "description": "Make scalloped cards using your Spellbinder's Dies and PC Cuttlebug.", "title": "Scalloped Notecards with Spellbinder's Dies", "publishedDate": "2008-03-19T15:55:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "92T6l3r_Y6w", "description": "Tazza \u2013 19. \uc790\uadf9\ud558\ub294 \uc544\uadc0 (Monkfish to stimuli) [The High Rollers 2 OST]\n\nVarious Artists \u2013 \ud0c0\uc9dc \u2013 \uc2e0\uc758 \uc190 OST\nRelease Date: 2014.09.03\nGenre: OST\nLanguage: Korean\n\nTrack List:\n01. \ud0c0\uc9dc \u2013 \uc2e0\uc758 \uc190 Main Title \u2013 \uae40\uc900\uc11d\n02. \uc11c\uc2e4\uc7a5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc900\ube44 \u2013 \uae40\uc900\uc11d\n03. \uaf2c\uc7a5 \ud558\uc6b0\uc2a4 \u2013 \uae40\uc900\uc11d\n04. \uc2b9\uc2b9\uc7a5\uad6c \u2013 \uae40\uc900\uc11d\n05. \uc870\ud654\ubc31\uacfc \ube80\ucc0c \u2013 \uae40\uc900\uc11d\n06. \uc6b0\uc0ac\uc7a5\uacfc \ub300\uae38 \u2013 \uae40\uc900\uc11d\n07. \uc7a5\ub3d9\uc2dd\uacfc \ub300\uae38\uc758 \ub300\uacb0 \u2013 \uae40\uc900\uc11d\n08.

I'm doing this with the minimum level allowed each battle, except for a few missions where the exp given during other missions and main storyline, as well as the side quests for important skills like Nimble Dash and Critical Hit, were too great to stop me from leveling.\n\nThere are a few reasons I chose to do iSolo videos in normal mode and with the easiest oath or none at all:\n1. Normal mode gives more HP to the boss, thereby forcing me to keep up whatever strategy I figure out during the making of the video (or prior knowledge of the boss from past playthroughs).\n2. Combat exp is lessened during normal mode, as compared to hard or hero modes, and will help prevent premature leveling.\n3. Normal mode shows the boss HP, whereas hard and hero do not. This allows me to gain the extra BP (battle points) from the mission to make my progression to later missions faster, which enables me to do many missions with just one playthrough, thereby-- again-- helping to prevent premature leveling.\n4. Normal mode helps understand what attacks one should use, in that I am always aware of how much damage a certain type of attack does, whether that attack be from an object, secondary weapon, or a specific attack combination from iSolo, himself.\n\nAlso, please note that I will rarely (if ever) use potions during these videos. I feel that using potions during normal mode is basically infinite HP, being that the damage done is cut by quite a bit. There are moments during these videos that, had they been on hard or obviously hero modes, I would most certainly have been killed. This does NOT give me pause, however. The point, again, is to show the bosses moves and a players ability to run a mission and develop strategy on the fly.\n\nI do not practice these missions. I have played them before with my main character, but many of these bosses feel new to me; its been so long since having to actually worry about dodging. My main character is a Spear Lann, not swords. Add to that, he is a capped exp and AP character with the highest weapon and armor available, both of which are highly upgraded.\n\nThe point I am making with this statement is that I'm not used to these bosses, I'm not used to swords, and I'm definitely not used to \"worrying\" about dying during a run. My main is in an amazing guild called Samsara and we are very highly ranked on the west server with many uniquely active players (not alts). I rarely solo with my main as that is not community-oriented enough for me. Soloing is purely a fascination, not something I strive to be able to accomplish, especially not with perfection. I will get hit. I will die. I am ok with that.

Entre as 11 faixas do novo trabalho produzido por Edi Roque do New Old School Studio, um passeio pela mistura de sonoridades inspiradas pelo rap e letras que se encontram com a tem\u00e1tica da trajet\u00f3ria de Charles Foster Kane ilustrada no filme Cidad\u00e3o Kane de 1941. Engajado na cria\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00fasicas que retratam o dia a dia, falando sobre temas como supera\u00e7\u00e3o, perseveran\u00e7a, positividade, amizade e respeito, Vitor transcende as expectativas ao tra\u00e7ar um paralelo entre as mensagens de cada faixa com a hist\u00f3ria abordada nesse filme, um dos mais famosos do mundo, e sua realidade de forma muito natural.\n\nA abertura fica por conta de Aben\u00e7oado, uma m\u00fasica de agradecimento pelo momento atual e pelas pessoas que o cercam. Brindar a Vida segue a linha celebrando o que faz bem e enaltecendo a positividade, enquanto Fortaleza sugere manter sempre a cabe\u00e7a erguida sendo forte para enfrentar tudo que a vida prop\u00f5e. Rosebud foi a \u00faltima palavra dita pelo Cidad\u00e3o Kane antes de sua morte, depois de ter sido um magnata milion\u00e1rio e famoso, ficou sem nada, sem fam\u00edlia, sem ningu\u00e9m e em seu \u00faltimo suspiro lembrou-se de um brinquedo da inf\u00e2ncia que tinha esse nome, ela reflete sobre a valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o das coisas simples, invers\u00e3o de valores e a rela\u00e7\u00e3o da felicidade com dinheiro e poder. \n\nUma homenagem ao seu pai precede a sua hist\u00f3ria contando um pouco da vida de F\u00e1bio Vieira desde crian\u00e7a at\u00e9 o seu nascimento em Estrela. O amor \u00e0 m\u00fasica \u00e9 descrito em Mineiro que fala um pouquinho tamb\u00e9m sobre o jeito Vitor Vieira de ser al\u00e9m de mostrar a vontade que tem de fazer m\u00fasica e ver as pessoas felizes e fortes. O cora\u00e7\u00e3o de menino apaixonado revela-se em Quando Ela Passa com a descri\u00e7\u00e3o de uma menina mulher cheia de atitude e personalidade e em De Frente pro Mar hit praiano sobre os caminhos da conquista. Tudo que Eu preciso enaltece o amor, mostrando a import\u00e2ncia de demonstrar e cultivar esse sentimento que move o mundo e conta com a participa\u00e7\u00e3o da cantora Amanda Maciel. O universo das drogas, sempre presente na vida dos adolescentes, vem \u00e0 tona em Bela Adormecida, m\u00fasica com final tr\u00e1gico que faz uma s\u00edntese sobre a luta contra a depend\u00eancia qu\u00edmica. Matem\u00e1tica da Vida fecha o novo disco com um poema sobre a esperan\u00e7a e a for\u00e7a do pensamento.\n\n\"A principal mensagem \u00e9 que voc\u00ea sempre mantenha o sorriso, seja forte, independente de qu\u00e3o grande sejam os problemas, com um sorriso voc\u00ea pode mudar a vida de uma pessoa, e sempre valorizar aquilo que te faz feliz.\" Vitor Vieira\n\nRosebud segue uma linha de arranjo e instrumenta\u00e7\u00e3o diferente das conhecidas bases sampleadas que s\u00e3o muito utilizadas no universo do rap. Todas as m\u00fasicas contam com grava\u00e7\u00f5es ac\u00fasticas de instrumentos como bateria por Johnny Mazza, baixo por Rodrigo Silva e acordes de guitarras, viol\u00f5es e teclados comandados pelo produtor Edi Roque. Outra experi\u00eancia \u00fanica foi a grava\u00e7\u00e3o em sistema 100% anal\u00f3gico registrando toda a energia e performance dos artistas da forma mais pura poss\u00edvel. .\n\n\nJOIN QUIZGROUP PARTNER PROGRAM: http://join.quizgroup.com/ .", "title": "Rosebud - Vitor Vieira", "publishedDate": "2014-06-02T03:45:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "92_h-Xb32d0", "description": "Live at Bayerischen Staaoper.

Ogre\n\nMusic : All This Down Time, Jingle Punks; YouTube Audio Library\n\nLatvia, officially the Republic of Latvia (Latvian: Latvijas Republika), is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe, one of the three Baltic states. It is bordered by Estonia, Lithuania, Russia, Belarus and by a maritime border to the west with Sweden. Latvia has 1,997,500 inhabitants[5] and a territory of 64,589 km2 (24,938 sq mi). The country has a temperate seasonal climate.\n\nLatvia is a democratic parliamentary republic established in 1918. The capital city is Riga, the European Capital of Culture 2014. Latvian is the official language. Latvia is a unitary state, divided into 118 administrative divisions of which 109 are municipalities and 9 are cities. There are five planning regions: Kurzeme, Latgale, Riga, Vidzeme and Zemgale.\n\nLatvians and Livs are the indigenous people of Latvia. Latvian is an Indo-European language; it and Lithuanian are the only two surviving Baltic languages. Despite foreign rule from the 13th to 20th centuries, the Latvian nation maintained its identity throughout the generations via the language and musical traditions. Latvia and Estonia share a long common history. As a consequence of the Soviet occupation both countries are home to a large number of ethnic Russians (26.9% in Latvia and 25.5% in Estonia, some of whom are non-citizens. Latvia is historically predominantly Protestant Lutheran, except for the Latgale region in the southeast, which has historically been predominantly Roman Catholic.\n\nThe Republic of Latvia was founded on 18 November 1918. However, its de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II. In 1940, the country was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union, invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941, and re-occupied by the Soviets in 1944 to form the Latvian SSR for the next fifty years. The peaceful Singing Revolution, starting in 1987, called for Baltic emancipation of Soviet rule. It ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, and Latvia declared the restoration of its de facto independence on 21 August 1991.\n\nLatvia is a member of NATO, European Union, United Nations, Council of Europe, CBSS, IMF, NB8, NIB, OSCE, and WTO. It is currently in the accession process for joining the OECD. For 2013, Latvia is listed 48th on the Human Development Index and as a high income country until the first of July 2014. It used the Latvian lats as its currency until this was replaced by the euro on 1 January 2014.\n\nAround 3000 BCE, the proto-Baltic ancestors of the Latvian people settled on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea.[19] The Balts established trade routes to Rome and Byzantium, trading local amber for precious metals. By 900 CE, four distinct Baltic tribes inhabited Latvia: Curonians, Latgalians, Selonians, Semigallians (in Latvian: kur\u0161i, latga\u013ci, s\u0113\u013ci and zemga\u013ci), as well as the Livonians (l\u012bbie\u0161i) speaking a Finnic language.\n\nAlthough the local people had contact with the outside world for centuries, they were more fully integrated into European society in the 12th century. The first missionaries, sent by the Pope, sailed up the Daugava River in the late 12th century, seeking converts. The local people, however, did not convert to Christianity as readily as hoped. German crusaders were sent into Latvia to convert the population from their original pagan beliefs by force of arms.\n\nIn the beginning of the 13th century, large parts of today's Latvia were ruled by Germans. Together with Southern Estonia, these conquered areas formed the crusader state that became known as Terra Mariana or Livonia. In 1282, Riga, and later the cities of C\u0113sis, Limba\u017ei, Koknese and Valmiera, were included in the Hanseatic League. Riga became an important point of east-west trading and formed close cultural contacts with Western Europe.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia", "title": "Top 10 Largest Cities or Towns of Latvia", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T12:00:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "92aPxn7gY_A", "description": "This is the hardest song I know, its difficult enough on my classical guitar but I love the way it sounds on the acoustic.

If two lines are cut by a transversal and corresponding angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel. If two lines are cut by a transversal and alternate interior angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel. If two lines are cut by a transversal and same-side interior angles are supplementary, then the lines are parallel.

La principal caracter\u00edstica es la aparici\u00f3n de los primeros seres humanos, una nueva especie que se caracteriza por aspectos claramente distintivos, como una mayor capacidad craneana, la posibilidad de andar erguido o la facultad de elaborar un lenguaje o fabricar instrumentos, entre otras. Los restos de seres humanos m\u00e1s antiguos se han hallado en el oriente africano, donde se han encontrado f\u00f3siles de Australopitecos, de Homo h\u00e1bilis y Homo erectus, quien se extender\u00e1 a otros continentes. Hace 100.000 a\u00f1os, el surgimiento de una nueva especie, el Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, dar\u00e1 inicio a un nuevo periodo, el Paleol\u00edtico medio. Durante el Paleol\u00edtico Inferior, cada vez se fabrican m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s complejos \u00fatiles en piedra. En Espa\u00f1a, los m\u00e1s antiguos se han hallado en la sierra de Atapuerca, y se relacionan con el Homo antecesor, el primer poblador europeo del que se tiene noticia, datado en unos 800.000 a\u00f1os. Sin embargo, la industria l\u00edtica m\u00e1s representada es el achelense, que abarca entre el 500.000 y el 90.000 antes de Cristo. Son muchos los yacimientos del periodo achelense hallados en la pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica, generalmente situados junto a terrazas fluviales o cuevas. Se trata de una industria m\u00e1s desarrollada, con herramientas como bifaces, hendedores y lascas, instrumentos utilizados por el Homo erectus para asegurar su alimentaci\u00f3n. --\nSuscr\u00edbete a nuestro canal : \n\u25b6 http://bit.ly/10rPVgk\n\nS\u00edguenos en: \n\u25b6 https://www.facebook.com/artehistoria\n\u25b6 http://pinterest.com/artehistoria/\n\u25b6 https://twitter.com/ArteHistoriaCom\n\u25b6 http://www.youtube.com/artehistoriacom/\n\nArteHistoria : la web del Arte y la Cultura en espa\u00f1ol.\n\nArtehistoria es una iniciativa privada dedicada a la creaci\u00f3n de contenidos culturales mediante la utilizaci\u00f3n de t\u00e9cnicas inform\u00e1ticas de \u00faltima generaci\u00f3n en las que se combinan las recreaciones y animaciones tridimensionales de ciudades, edificios y escenas de vida cotidiana a muy alta poligonizaci\u00f3n, con la creaci\u00f3n de mapas evolutivos, estudios compositivos, digitalizaci\u00f3n de documentos, etc. Todo ello acompa\u00f1ado siempre de una informaci\u00f3n documental avalada por los profesores m\u00e1s destacados de la Universidad espa\u00f1ola.

Twenty one years ago, however, we would have been faced with this.\n\nHaving retired \"Think Before You Drink Before You Drive\" as the Thatcher years grew ever harder and colder, COI (and the ad agencies to which they were outsourcing the actual job of making the PIFs by now) flailed around throughout the mid-eighties, first attempting an impression of the working classes with \"Fancy a Jar? Forget the Car\", which didn't work, and then throwing up their hands and saying \"I just don't know\" with the frankly inexplicable 85/86 \"Stay Low\" campaign, in which they said \"go ahead and drink, just for God's sake at least don't drink a lot, okay?\"\n\nDidn't work.\n\nSo 1987 rolls around and they change tack again. \"Think Before You Drink\" had long descended from genuinely harrowing stories about death and injury into skits about men unable to buy insurance or go out on the town because they lost their licenses. The obvious direction to head in was the path they'd started down over a decade before with \"Don't Take Your Car For A Drink\" - that of human consequences.\n\nSo far so usual, but then they decided  to depict the human consequences not in the usual way (ie with blood, gore, tears, and Gillian Taylforth's head lolling in front of a shattered windscreen like a hairspray-festooned pinata full of ketchup) but by going all Robert Altman: naturalistic stories of death, misery and horror, told straight to camera, with no non-diegetic sound. And in one take to boot. The finishing touch was the new,  brutally uncompromising tagline, the first (black pun on \"wrecks\" notwithstanding) not to attempt to be cute in any way. It proved so powerful and effective that, long after the PIFs themselves had moved on from their original conceit, it - and its style of presentation: sans serif, white on black, more often than not in this two-line style - stuck around until it was finally deemed over-familiar and retired in 1996.\n\nThis is \"The Fireman's Tale\" - all of the initial DADWL films were the something's tale - and the fireman in question is played by the great Ken Stott. It's genuinely harrowing, thanks in no small part to the big man's performance, but it contains about the same amount of camerawork as \"Moment of Doubt\". The full version of the latter has an establishing shot of the guy walking up to the bar, and this one has a brief track back as Stott comes into the office, but apart from that they basically consist of single shots. And yet this one is powerful, even horrifying, while the other is ridiculous and near-impossible to take seriously. It's the difference between going for realism, which THINK! tended toward in its earlier years (remember the nightvision sleeping-at-the-wheel one, which also contained an extended static shot) and mannerism, stylisation, or simply bathos. The last time THINK! had that edge was probably the cameraphone PIF.\n\nEven that actually depicted an accident for its effect. All this depicts is a fireman returning from one, and is perhaps even more powerful. No shock moment, just a haunting word picture.\n\nDDWL continued in this vein for a while - later examples include \"Pier\" which I uploaded 500 years ago, and \"Real Lives\", an extended, almost impressionistic PIF which watches an entire family cope with the death of their young son, and which (according to the news clipping) seems to be set in my home town. Eventually they expanded past realism, with the Summertime one being a good example, but they never lost sight of the basic ethos of human consequences being at the centre. (Drinking and Driving PIFs did eventually embrace expressionism and representational symbolism at the turn of the century, but by then the DDWL slogan had been retired.)", "title": "Ken Stott's Tears", "publishedDate": "2008-12-01T19:53:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "92pdFP4UFWU", "description": "CONSEGUI \"LA REINA DEL PLACER (VERSION EN VIVO)\" EN TODO EL MUNDO EN:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ar/album/desde-las-sombras/id446436175\n\nEscuchalo En Spotify:\nhttp://open.spotify.com/album/4naBROt4w2Zpy5bcxReRQa\n\nEscuchalo En Deezer:\nhttp://www.deezer.com/album/1159494\n\nPlaylist videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4AqHJKorsE&list=PLF66DE4FF3A41FBF3\nhttp://www.piersite.com.ar\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pieroficial\nhttps://twitter.com/pier_oficial\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/pieroficial\n\nARTISTA: PIER\nTEMA: LA REINA DEL PLACER\nEXTRAIDO DEL ALBUM \"DESDE LAS SOMBRAS\", GRABADO EN VIVO EN EL ESTADIO OBRAS.", "title": "Pier - La Reina del Placer (DVD vivo \"Desde las sombras\", Vivo Estadio Obras) [HD]", "publishedDate": "2012-09-26T23:47:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "92pge5ZLNAc", "description": "", "title": "Antauro Humala: Sendero Luminoso y el MRTA son la izquierda macha", "publishedDate": "2012-11-25T18:07:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "92ps_KYMm1g", "description": "$4 billion will have been spent on the 2014 midterm elections by the time they're over, and a lot of that in so-called dark money.

Song and dance, painting, traditions, and making a living -- these are the themes of his research journey to the origins of Australian culture. The action scenes are Angatja in Northwest South Australia, near Uluru/Ayers Rock, and Utopia in Northern Territory. As an original contribution to intercultural dialogue, the song \"Uluru, Ulurunya\" by Ivy Nganyinytja, Mabel Tjulkiwa and Jeannie Kunmanara from Angatja bears witness to the interactive encounter with Robert Bachmann and his music. \"The Fractal Dreamtime\" shows rarely movieed ritual Aboriginal song and dance scenes, and the composer's meeting in Utopia with the Australian painter Dave Pwerle Ross who created the ULURU picture \"Two Star Men\".

If you do not know him yet then you will. His painting are hung in many countries, in sheikhs palaces, celebrity houses, or if you are really  filthy rich.\nHow many times have you come across an artist who makes a painting while simultaneously riding a cycle backwards, levitate in the air or jump from a plane just to make a painting? \nAs absurd and crazy as he sounds, Gurmej Singh is one such artist who pushes his creativity infinitely. He tries to combine his zeal for adventure and passion for art in a unique and bold manner. He has discovered several new techniques of painting like Singhism, Singh Letterism, Centrism, Flowism, No-touch, Parallel Processing, and Stunt Art. \nBorn on April 9, in Punjab, India, he later moved to Dubai, United Arab Emirates in 1981 and then to Emporia, Kansas in 1998.\n\u00a0Currently residing in  both Dubai and United States. Still youthful and vigorous, Singh promises, \"I am just getting started!\" \n\u00a0\"I have found my self working in all circumstances like levitating, burnt alive, buried alive, caged for several days, standing on 30 feet tall pole for three days, backward cycle riding, atop a bridge, on a tree, hanging upside down, walking a tight rope or jumping from a building in order to add difficulty to symbolize the struggle that needs to exist for culture and science to progress at higher level\".

Theism, in this specific sense, conceives of God as personal, present and active in the governance and organization of the world and the universe. As such theism describes the classical conception of God that is found in Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Sikhism and Hinduism. The use of the word theism to indicate this classical form of monotheism began during the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century in order to distinguish it from the then-emerging deism which contended that God, though transcendent and supreme, did not intervene in the natural world and could be known rationally but not via revelation.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC:BA 3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theism\n\nText to Speech powered by TTS-API.COM\n\nImages are Public Domain", "title": "All About - Theism", "publishedDate": "2014-06-26T00:33:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "93dj7ykJ8sg", "description": "Original video to the single 'My Town' taken from the album 'Before You Leave' .\n\nhttp://racoon.nl/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/racoonband\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/racoonband\nhttp://racoonband.hyves.nl/", "title": "Racoon My Town", "publishedDate": "2009-03-01T22:29:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "93e0dmtf2UA", "description": "New administrative tools features in Windows 8\n\nhttp://www.mobiletweaks.net\n\nclick here to view next tutorial:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93e0dmtf2UA", "title": "Administrative Tools in Windows 8", "publishedDate": "2012-12-24T18:35:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "93eSMGRgq3M", "description": "http://www.millsuppliers.com/contact/contact.html\n\nzenith is an internationally renowned manufacturer of mining machinery Equipment Co., Ltd.

This bird and its American sister species, the Spotted Sandpiper (A. macularia), make up the genus Actitis. They are parapatric and replace each other geographically; stray birds of either species may settle down with breeders of the other and hybridize. Hybridization has also been reported between the Common Sandpiper and the Green Sandpiper, a basal species of the closely related shank genus Tringa.\n\nThe adult is 18--20 cm long with a 32--35 cm wingspan. It has greyish-brown upperparts, white underparts, short dark-yellowish legs and feet, and a bill with a pale base and dark tip. In winter plumage, they are duller and have more conspicuous barring on the wings, though this is still only visible at close range. Juveniles are more heavily barred above and have buff edges to the wing feathers.\n\nThis species is very similar to the slightly larger Spotted Sandpiper (A. macularia) in non-breeding plumage. But its darker legs and feet and the crisper wing pattern (visible in flight) tend to give it away, and of course they are only rarely found in the same location.\n\nThe Sariska Tiger Reserve is an Indian national park located in the Alwar district of the state of Rajasthan. The topography of Sariska supports scrub-thorn arid forests, dry deciduous forests, rocks and grasses. This area was a hunting preserve of the erstwhile Alwar state and it was declared a wildlife reserve in 1955. In 1978, it was given the status of a tiger reserve making it a part of India's Project Tiger scheme. The present area of the park is 866 km\u00b2. The park is situated 107 km from Jaipur and 200 km from Delhi.\n\nThe area of Sariska, being a part of the Aravalli Range, is rich in mineral resources, such as copper. In spite of the Supreme Court's 1991 ban on mining in the area, marble mining continues to threaten the environment.\n\nThe best and the most attractive feature of the Sariska Tiger Reserve has always been its Bengal Tigers. This is the first ever Tiger Reserve in the world where the relocation of tigers has been done successfully, makes it one of a kind. The best part of the relocation is that these tigers adapted the place very quickly which is resulting in the growth of their population.\n\nApart from the Bengali Tiger, Sariska Tiger Reserve includes many wild-lives like leopard, jungle cat, caracal, striped hyena, golden jackal, chital, sambhar, nilgai, chinkara, four-horned antelope 'chousingha' (extinct), wild boar, hare, hanuman langur, Rhesus monkeys, and plenty of bird species and reptiles. Birds include peafowl, grey partridge, bush quail, sand grouse, tree pie, golden-backed woodpecker, crested serpent eagle and the Great Indian Horned Owl.\n\nThe dominant tree in the forests is dhok (Anogeissus pendula). Other trees include the salar (Boswellia serrata), kadaya (Sterculia urens), dhak (Butea monosperma), gol (Lannea coromandelica), ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) and khair (Acacia catechu). Bargad (Ficus benghalensis), arjun (Terminalia arjuna), gugal (Commiphora wightii) or bamboo can also be met at some places. Shubs are numerous, such as kair (Capparis decidua), adusta (Adhatoda vesica) and jhar ber (Ziziphus nummularia).\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Usually seen in pairs or small groups not far from water but may form large flocks in the non-breeding season (winter). Red-wattled Lapwings are large waders, about 35 cm long. The wings and back are light brown with a purple sheen, but head and chest and front part of neck are black. Prominently white patch runs between these two colours, from belly and tail, flanking the neck to the sides of crown. Short tail is tipped black. A red fleshy wattle in front of each eye, black-tipped red bill, and the long legs are yellow. In flight, prominent white wing bars formed by the white on the secondary coverts.\n\nRace aigneri is slightly paler and larger than the nominate race and is found in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Indus valley. The nominate race is found all over India. The Sri Lankan race lankae is smaller and dark while atronuchalis the race in north-eastern India and eastern Bangladesh has a white cheek surrounded by black.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

In an evolutionary sense, birds are a living group of dinosaurs because they descended from the common ancestor of all dinosaurs. Other than birds, however, there is no scientific evidence that any dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor, Apatosaurus, Stegosaurus, or Triceratops, are still alive. These, and all other nonavian dinosaurs became extinct at least 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous Period.\n\nMany, shared, evolutionary characteristics can be found in the skeletons of birds and other dinosaurs. One can follow the development of these evolutionary innovations by following along the evolutionary tree of dinosaurs from larger groups into successively smaller ones.\nBirds' hips have a hole in the hip socket, just like all other dinosaurs. This feature was inherited from the common ancestor of dinosaurs and allowed dinosaurs to walk with an upright posture. Next, the bones of birds are hollow, and the hind feet of birds have three toes that point forward and one toe that points backwards, just like the hollow bones and three-toed feet inherited from the common ancestor of all meat-eating or theropod dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus. \n\nFinally, the wrist of birds is built around a crescent-shaped bone called the semi-lunate carpal, just as the wrist of Velociraptor is. This wrist bone was inherited from the common ancestor of birds, Velociraptor, and other dinosaurs that belong to the group called maniraptors. As documented by these characteristics, birds evolved from the first dinosaur, the first theropod dinosaur, and the first maniraptor. So scientifically, birds are members of all of these groups of dinosaurs. \n\nSo, in an evolutionary sense, birds are a living group of dinosaurs, and although no nonavian dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus or Triceratops, still exist, dinosaurs are not extinct! You see dinosaurs flying around in the sky and perching in trees every day!\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

It says the changes are required to achieve the right balance between \"customer service, public protection and organisational requirements\", adding: \"These changes are being published now in light of the need to speed up turnaround times.\"\n\nThe government's admission of problems in the passport system comes after several days of denials, but on Wednesday David Cameron blamed the situation on the fact that the Passport Office was facing 300,000 more applications than usual, which was \"above normal\", as he accused Ed Miliband of frightening holidaymakers.\n\nHe told MPs: \"The Home Office has been on this from the very start.\"\n\nCameron said he understood people's anxiety but said that fewer than 10% of the 300,000 cases were not being processed in the normal three-week target. But the 10% referred to by Cameron are understood to be made up of the most basic applications, while complicated cases could take the total backlog much higher.\n\nMiliband said the problem had been caused by cuts and a failure by Theresa May, the home secretary, to keep watch as she was bickering with the education secretary. \"Tens of thousands of people are finding their holidays are being cancelled because they are not actually getting a passport,\" he said. The briefing note, written by the Passport Office's policy team and entitled \"Overseas Policy and Procedure Changes\", begins by listing a number of policy changes and informs staff that they can now relax checks if an applicant from abroad asks for a passport to be sent to an alternative address.\n\nIn these cases, evidence of a link to that address -- such as a documentary evidence of a connection to the alternative property -- will no longer be mandatory and the applicant will no longer have to sign a disclaimer form. The document states: \"It has been agreed that, where an applicant provides an alternative address, a separate 'disclaimer' and evidence of a link to that address will no longer be mandatory if there are no other concerns or fraud indicators.\"\n\nStaff sources claim the change could aide a fraudster who has applied for a document. Checks on countersignatories -- a person of good standing or in a recognised profession who vouches for an applicant -- have also been relaxed. The note says that a photocopy or scan of national ID cards from many European countries as well as Hong Kong will now be allowed as proof of evidence of a countersignatory's identity.\n\n\"On a discretionary basis, a photocopy or emailed scan of a countersignatory's current valid national identity card can be accepted instead of a passport copy, if the card is issued from one of the countries listed below to one of their nationals,\" the document says.\n\nAccording to the note, if an applicant is seeking a second passport -- which many frequent fliers use so they can travel on one document whilst applying for entry with another -- staff no longer need to seek a letter confirming their status from an employer or accountant.\n\n\"For an application for a first additional passport where the applicant has provided their passport, the examiner can use their discretion to not seek a letter of confirmation from an employer where other information indicates that the applicant is eligible for an additional passport,\" it says.\n\nPreviously, the Passport Office has strictly enforced a requirement for a letter of confirmation from an employer or a self-employed person's accountant. But sources say the change raises the possibility of identity theft because it could allow a fraudster who has stolen a UK passport to apply for a second.\n\nYvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, said the briefing showed the government was in denial about the state of the crisis and had been reduced to scaling back vital security checks. \"This is seriously chaotic ... if this is what the prime minister meant by getting a grip with the situation, he needs to think again,\" she said.\n\nI created this video with the YouTube Slideshow Creator (http://www.youtube.com/upload)", "title": "Passport Office orders staff to relax application checks to help clear backlog", "publishedDate": "2014-06-12T00:30:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "94D0ELKDuVc", "description": "15-second TV Spot from Rio Metro and ABQ RIDE for the Dump the Pump campaign.

By injection of neuroleptics and tranquilizers during long time it is possible to undermine health and lead a sacrifice to distrophy and death. After this fascism by medical poisoning of Anna Matskevich , she can't  move as she did one month ago. Maybe modern jews have forgotten Hitler's time ,when a lot of jewish people were put in concentrated camps , where nazis used them for different kind of experiments .\nAnna Matskevich just wants to be released from these inhuman barbarian experimnets  on the personality , dignity , health.\nThe application against  lawlessness of police together with paid liers ,participated in the fabrications against Anna Matskevich was sent to the investigative Committee of the Russian Federation and to the Office of Moscow city government. Ofcourse it is all the same to them - they just forward all claims to responsible for legal bureaucratic failure structures of Ministry of internal Affairs or to police structures.Non-governmental Human rights organizations are afraid to interefere in the break of human rights on territory of Russian Federation , because only organization appointed by President of Russia for \"control\" of human rights can decide about existance of rough human right's break...\n\nAt the moment the world is approaching to final maybe collapse between East and West. So nobody will be worried about the fate of the people repressed just for  video records on moscow streets.\nBy neuroleptic's injection with simmulteneous sleep limitization and physicall exaust through staff demands to move all day along corridors it is possible to turn a human into animal by erasing personality.This is real fascistic system of health undermine. In night time the staff makes noise and provokes by shouting interrupting normal sleep.\n\nAnna Matskevich as a person ( a human) is the same as ordinary people , who just like to make video records on streets of big cities.  Russia's state mentality (state machine) does all best to prevent any expressions of oppinion and individuality , especially when it is in english language... The crowd maybe just feels some threat through video reflection of societi's citzen life , behaviour and traditions inside the country. Therefore there is a lot of \"opportunities\" to construct different accusations and fabrications.  As you know Anna Matskevich just every day goes for in sport for some training in style of chienese gymnastik ,  what  maybe by ideological or religian reasons cause anger of some men and women , who express agressity , start to fight or just call police , because for Russia it is up normal when a woman (non of Kremling establishment) so impudently makes sport training in the forest on frost , without their permission....... ! After detaining and blowing by very right policemen  ,the offender will be sent by them to psychatric hospital with a lot of stories and reports about her inadiquate behaviour. In the psychiatry hospital after \"arriving\" the \"offender\" immediately will get strong injection of neroleptics , and 3-4 days later will be brought to so called \"court\" inside the clinic without any opportunity to speak on the hearing without neuroleptics (Haloperidol) in blood . By this way  court makes standart decision standartly against Anna.  \n\nP.S. Last time Anna was detained by police on 06.05.2013 at the moment  of start of anti-Putin's action on \"Bolotnaya\" square. She did'nt participate in the action, but also was sent to psychatric clinic.\n\n\nP,S,\n\nOn 15-th August 2014 my wife Anna Matskevich was attacked in moscow district Kuzminky by hooligans , who blocked her in post office and called police , which also blowed Anna and forwarded her to the psychiatric clinic with lie accusations. On 19-th August she was brough to so called court hearing under strong psychotropic medicals. My opposing that the staff of the clinic used strong psychotropic medicals before the hearing and that Anna is in the clinic by fabrications by paid liers were ignored by the Judge from local moscow \"Lyublinsky\" court Mr. Matlachov A.S. , who made decision for forcible treatment of Anna Matskevich in the psychiatry clinic. I visited Anna next day after hearing : she informed me , that it is forbidden for her even to move inside the room ,were she is isolated. It is also vey limited for her just to wash her face , she does not get back her glases , inspite her dioptry is - 8 ! A contacted to her doctor to Mrs. Sevryukova T.A. and pointed on those things asked not to break Anna's human rights on minimym civilization.On 21-st August I contacted to Deputy chief doctor Mr. Fedin E.Y. He did'nt advice me to make cassation appeal against Anna's psychiatry imprisonment and allowed only she sign the cassation appeal.\n\nThe Moscow psychiatry clinic \u2116 13 in soviet time was an instrument of KGB against dissidents.

It has hardly anything to do with it, really. I was pointing more toward the direction of Twilight gaining responsibility as ruler after Celestia. Without immortality, her time as ruler would be utterly short. I always imagined she would rule at a certain point, so she must become immortal at some point.\n\nAnd who says she wouldn't be immortal after becoming an alicorn? It's highly possible, anyway. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but please don't go saying I'm wrong about my own lyrics.

Dzi\u0119ki sojuszowi z Zinowiewem i Kamieniewem, Stalin wyszed\u0142 z niej zwyci\u0119sko, a Trocki uda\u0142 si\u0119 na emigracj\u0119 ( zamordowany w 1940 r. w Meksyku na polecenie Stalina.)\nW 1929 r. Stalin og\u0142osi\u0142 pierwszy plan pi\u0119cioletni, kt\u00f3rego celem by\u0142a industrializacja. Poniewa\u017c dostawy zbo\u017ca do miast i fabryk by\u0142y niewystarczaj\u0105ce, Stalin zdecydowa\u0142 si\u0119 na reform\u0119 roln\u0105 (kolektywizacja rolnictwa). Polega\u0142a ona na odebraniu ziemi ch\u0142opom i utworzeniu z nich pa\u0144stwowych sowchoz\u00f3w i ko\u0142choz\u00f3w.\nWi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 ch\u0142op\u00f3w, szczeg\u00f3lnie najbogatszych na Ukrainie - zwanych ku\u0142akami, sprzeciwia\u0142a si\u0119 kolektywizacji. Stalin oskar\u017cy\u0142 ich o ukrywanie zbo\u017ca i sabota\u017c. Wynikiem akcji rekwirowania zbo\u017ca by\u0142o zabieranie rolnikom nadwy\u017cek ziarna, tak\u017ce tego przeznaczonego na zasiew. Dzia\u0142ania te doprowadzi\u0142y w latach 1932-1933 do Wielkiego G\u0142odu na Ukrainie (Ho\u0142odomor), w czasie kt\u00f3rego zmar\u0142o ok. 7 milion\u00f3w ludzi.  \nPolityka Stalina nie uzyska\u0142a aprobaty delegat\u00f3w na XVII Zjazd Partii (1934). Nowego przyw\u00f3dc\u0119 upatrywano w Siergieju Kirowie, jednak\u017ce w wyniku sfa\u0142szowanych wybor\u00f3w, Stalin utrzyma\u0142 swoje stanowisko. Zab\u00f3jstwo Kirowa u\u0142atwi\u0142o mu rozprawienie si\u0119 ze starymi bolszewikami (byli to m.in.: Zinowiew, Kamieniew, Bucharin, Rykow). Terror przybra\u0142 na sile, kiedy szefem NKWD zosta\u0142 N. Je\u017cow. Aresztowano miliony ludzi (wed\u0142ug r\u00f3\u017cnych szacunk\u00f3w od 7 do 20 mln). Skazanych umieszczano w obozach pracy (gu\u0142agach), gdzie umierali z g\u0142odu, zimna, przepracowania, a tak\u017ce okrutnego traktowania przez stra\u017cnik\u00f3w.\nPrze\u015bladowania obj\u0119\u0142y r\u00f3wnie\u017c Armi\u0119 Czerwon\u0105. Rozpocz\u0105\u0142 je proces marsza\u0142ka Michai\u0142a Tuchaczewskiego, oskar\u017conego o szpiegostwo na rzecz Niemiec. Wielka czystka w armii dotkn\u0119\u0142a ponad 40 000 oficer\u00f3w (w tym jej elit\u0119)\nZaj\u0119cie przez ZSRR we wrze\u015bniu 1939 r. teren\u00f3w Polski spowodowa\u0142o deportacje Polak\u00f3w w g\u0142\u0105b Zwi\u0105zku Sowieckiego. Wiosn\u0105 1940 r. blisko 22 000 polskich oficer\u00f3w i przedstawicieli inteligencji zosta\u0142o rozstrzelanych przez NKWD m.in. w Katyniu, Miednoje, Charkowie.\nPodczas II wojny \u015bwiatowej NKWD dokona\u0142o tak\u017ce egzekucji \u017co\u0142nierzy w\u0142asnej armii , oskar\u017conych o tch\u00f3rzostwo i dezercj\u0119. Liczb\u0119 rozstrzelanych trudno sprecyzowa\u0107, mog\u0142a si\u0119ga\u0107 setek tysi\u0119cy m\u0119\u017cczyzn .\n\nAfter Lenin's death in 1924, the struggle for leadership of the party took place between Stalin and Trotsky. Through the alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev, Stalin came out of this conflict victorious, and Trotsky went to live in exile  (murdered in 1940 in Mexico, on the basis of Stalin's instructions.)\nIn 1929, Stalin announced the first five-year plan aiming at the industrialization. Since the supply of grain to cities and factories was insufficient, Stalin decided to start land reforms (collectivization of agriculture), which was understood as took land from peasants, and creation of state farms: sovkhozes and kolkhozes.Most of the peasants, particularly the richest ones living in Ukraine, known as kulaks, opposed collectivization. Stalin accusing them of hiding grain and sabotage. As a result of Ukrainian shares requisition of grain, farmers in surplus and confiscated grain intended for sowing. This led to the Great Famine in Ukraine (Holodomor) in 1932-1933, which claimed approximately 7 000 000 people.\nStalin's policy has not obtained the approval of the delegates at the XVII Party Congress (1934). The new leader was seen in the person of Sergei Kirov, but as a result of rigged elections, Stalin maintained his position. In December Kirov was shot. This murder was for Stalin the beginning of attacks aimed at the old Bolsheviks (including Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Rykov).  Terror strengthened when the head of the NKVD was Yezhov. Millions of people (according to various estimates, from 7 to 20 miliions) were arrested ). Convicts were executed placed in labor camps (gulags), where they died from cold, starvation, overwork, and brutal treatment.\nThe persecution took place also the Red Army. The first victim was Marshal Tukhachevsky, accused of spying for Germany. The great purge in the army affected more than 40 000 officers, including the elite Red Army.\nIn WW2 over 400 000 Poles has been deportaded to USSR and 22 000 officers and intelectuallists were shot in Katyn Massacre.\nDuring 2WW NKVD killed hundreds of thousand Red Army soldiers accused of cowardice and desertion.\n\nThanks to gregor1985pl", "title": "Jelonek - B.East", "publishedDate": "2011-04-03T16:02:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "94dv5HPZDBY", "description": "iTUNES: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/geeving/id393067450\nMERCH: http://riserecords.merchnow.com/search/?q=abandon+all+ships\nClick Here to subscribe: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=riserecords\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/abandonallships\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/abandonallships\n\nLet me explain \nCause it drives me insane. \nJust to know you are there \nSeems like you don't care \nAnother ending the same. \n\nFuck you and everyone and everything. \nCause we all know whose king, \nWhen I'm still standing in the ring. \n\nIt's so hard to say, couldn't run away, \nIt's those games you played, wish you would've stayed. \nIt's so hard to say, couldn't run away, run away\n\nIn a dream she came to me (she came to me)\nBlinded by the light (light) \nPut up a fight (put up a fight)\nI couldn't see, couldn't see\n\nI never knew this was a war. \nLost count at you're a whore. \nKarma's fair but instead \nI'd rather see you dead. \n\nIt's so hard to say, couldn't run away, \nIt's those games you played, wish you would've stayed. \nIt's so hard to say, couldn't run away, run away\n\nIn a dream she came to me (she came to me)\nBlinded by the light (light) \nPut up a fight (put up a fight)\nI couldn't see, couldn't see\n\nI would walk through fire just to be with you. \nThere's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do. \n\nRun away.\n\nIn a dream she came to me (she came to me)\nBlinded by the light (light) \nPut up a fight (put up a fight)\nI couldn't see, couldn't see\n\nWe don't give a fuck we just came to party. \n\nI don't give a fuck I just came to party. \nWish you would have stayed. \nStay with me.", "title": "Abandon All Ships - Geeving Featuring Jhevon Paris (Official Music Video)", "publishedDate": "2010-12-17T18:49:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "94dwzYJzrcU", "description": "In this video I've converted from Gas to Propane.

The luring player then runs back and stands on top of the person in counterattack stance and continually loads icebolts and fires them to cancel the skills of the gargoyle, causing it to normal attack. After the gargoyle's attack has been countered, the icebolter must fire at least one bolt to buy time for the second player to ready counterattack again. This is repeated until the target is dead. \n\nWith gargoyles, be careful of stomp, as it is loaded very quickly and often without warning and can hit for 100+ damage. Also take note that only normal attacks can be countered, as smash affects only the target of the smash which is most likely the icebolter. If a gargoyle fires an icebolt, counterattack can be loaded during the stun animation.\n\nIf more than one gargoyle aggros, the icebolter needs to delay both gargoyles sufficiently for the counterattacker to prepare. It may be safer to engage the two gargoyles individually in this situation, or switch to windmill instead of counterattack.

The track requires a good balanced car and precise driving but it allowes some different lines through it's famous corners. The key to a good lap is to have a big confidence in the car.\n\n\nWhen going into qualifying lap, make sure you get as much heat as you can to the tyres as it it very vital on this track. When exiting the last chicane, get on the gas as soon as you can to get maximum out of the start-finish straight.\nTurn 1: Turn in and brake at the same time just before that access road on the left, this is where you'll need your rear end grip to be able to turn in without any oversteer otherwise you'll lose time. Downshift to 4th gear for the first part of turn and feel the car being pulled to the left side kerb. Downshift to 3rd, get close to inside kerb but don't touch it because the front of the car will get pulled inside resulting in a spin or a bad slide which will overheat the tyres. Use a bit of the kerb on the outside and upshift to fourth. \nS curves: This is a complex of 4 fast corners and it is very important to get a good line for the first turn in the complex because it sets you up for the rest of the Ses. For the first turn, fourth gear, no need to brake when in qualifying lap but when in race, touch the brakes a little bit to make sure you don't slide with a heavy fuel loaded car. For the second turn, downshift to third, over the inside kerb and don't let the car pull away to the left side on the exit so you have a good line for third turn. Upshift to fourth and catch the inside kerb a bit, let the car go all the way on the outside. For the fourth turn, downshift to third and let the car understeer a bit so you have a good line for the Dunlop Curve. \nOkay, the hardest part of the track is behind us, but that doesn't mean that the rest will be easy.\nDunlop Curve: 4th gear, don't even think about touching the inside kerb, it'll upset car's balance and you'll see yourself spinning. Use the outside kerb as much as you can but be careful not to lose the car over the bump because of the East Suzuka layout on the right. \nDegner Curves: Move all the way to left side, using all of the track available. Brake in between those Dunlop banners, turn in and jump with one wheel over the inside kerb, use as much kerb as you can on the outside. It is easy to over do Degner 1 so be careful no to miss the braking point or the inside kerb. Take a quick look at the split time, this is the point where you know if you have a good lap. Brake just before the ending of that exit kerb for Degner 2, downshift to 2nd gear and kiss the inside kerb. Again, use all of the track available on the exit but it is easy to climb the car over that kerb so play a bit with your ride height.  \nHairpin: This corner wouldn't be that tricky if there wasn't for that \"slight\" corner on the braking. Release the gas a bit and start braking just before that small corner ends, downshift to 2nd. Don't touch the inside kerb and get on the gas as soon as you can but be careful not to spin your wheels. \n200R: Flatout corner, nothing to say about this one.\nSpoon: My favourite Suzuka's corner. Brake when you see that access road on the right, not when you're next to it but when you see it. Downshift to 4th for the first part and then 3rd for the second part of the corner. Get close to the inside kerb but don't touch it and let the car roll to the right side, no need to brake for that second part. Use all of that paved exit to get a clean acceleration to that long straight.\n130R: One of the most challeging corners out there, just touch the brakes a bit, down to 5th and immediately full throttle and upshift, it is extremely important not to over do it as you can climb on that outside kerb and probably crash. \nCasio Triangle: It is hard to find a good braking reference here, I guess it every lap to \"just before Dunlop ad\". Down to 2nd, use all of the inside kerbs and feel the rear end grip as you exit the chicane. \nLast turn: This corner isn't that tricky but it might be when your tyres are worn because there is a little crest on top of which the car will become very light so be careful there.\n\nThe lap was done with last season't GT Open qualifying setup, the time was 1:59.783", "title": "EEC Suzuka lap instruction", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T23:15:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "94juxcR9F98", "description": "Ayla is 10.5 months old in this video.
