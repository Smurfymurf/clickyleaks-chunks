We are Anonymous.\n\nA number of you, as well as former employees have approached us at protests. Several more have contacted us through our message \n\nboards, through youtube, and through email. Anonymous regrets to hear how the Scientologists are running Durable Slate, how they \n\ncoerce people into taking classes which are actually designed to indoctrinate people into the cult of Scientology. Anonymous regrets \n\nhow they have no respect for your own beliefs and wishes.\n\nThis cannot be allowed to stand.\n\nAll companies have training and courses. Those other companies do not use training tied to a cult. The Federal government's own \n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission specifically cites Scientology run companies as being coercive in pushing Scientology \n\ncourses, and gives such places as examples of a Religiously Hostile Workplace.\n\nThis is what is happening at Durable Slate. Scientology does not respect the human rights of its members or critics, so why should \n\nit respect yours?Though the brothers who own Durable Slate, and the scientology staffers there step on your rights, it heartens \n\nAnonymous to see employees starting to stand up and to speak out. One employee was even bold enough to leave a comment on the \n\noriginal Message to Durable Slate video, confirming our allegations.Still, Anonymous invites more of you to speak out. Tell us your \n\nstories. Call local television stations, call into radio talk shows, contact the Columbus Dispatch or The Other Paper and tell them \n\nyour story. One person can be pushed aside, but when more speak up, interest is piqued and pressure felt.\n\nAnonymous recognizes these are tough economic times, and we do not wish that anyone should lose their job. Anonymous wishes Durable \n\nSlate to prosper and grow, but surely the scientologists at Durable Slate are more concerned with recruiting members to meet the \n\ncult's staffing and fundraising goals, than truly taking care of you or your customers. Ask yourself... where did the money from \n\nyour Christmas bonuses go? Why is there no longer money spent on a company picnic? Anonymous knows. The money is going to grow the \n\nlocal cult, and not rewarding you for your hard work, not in thanking you for your efforts. Ask yourself... other companies that \n\nmake you take training on your own time compensate you for that time; why does Durable Slate not do so when it makes you come down \n\nto the org building on High Street. Gas is not free, and your time is valuable.\n\nIs this right? Is this fair? Is it even reasonable that they should funnel money from the company to the cult and regard you as \"raw \n\nmeat\" for their pernicious and tumorous pyramid scheme? Anonymous says it is not. Anonymous invites you to stop by and see us at one \n\nof our protests, or to contact the EEOC at eeoc.gov.You are being exposed to undue stress and pressure. Pressure which is, in fact, \n\nillegal.\n\nScientology is a criminal organization that uses the methods of a cult to control and seduce. It is a proverbial wolf, dressed in \n\nsheep's clothing. You have the right to follow your conscience. You have the right to be treated with dignity and fairness under the \n\nlaw. You have the right to work to the best of your abilities without being indoctrinated into the cult of scientology.\n\nAnonymous, is watching. Anonymous, is planning. Anonymous, is doing.\n\n\nScientologists of Durable Slate, Anonymous is now at cause. Your malign influence will only be further exposed and shown to be the \n\ncancer it is. Anonymous is the chemotherapy. Knowledge and people are, and must be, free.\n\n\nWe are Anonymous.\n\nWe are Legion.\n\n\n\nWe do not forgive.

But despite becoming more prosperous in the 1990s, Yulin has maintained the unique tradition of holding a canine banquet every summer.\n\nAnimal rights activists across China and the rest of the globe have increasingly condemned the Dog Meat Festival, calling for an immediate stop to eating man\u2019s best friend. They say the dog meat trade is illegal, unregulated, and cruel. Many claim that numerous dogs that end up in cooking pots are stolen pets or diseased strays.\n\nIn 2013, the Yulin festival gathered so much negative press that this year, the local government denied the Summer Solstice dog-eating tradition ever even existed. But that hasn\u2019t stopped locals from celebrating\u2014nor has it stopped die-hard activists from flooding the town to try and rescue dogs before the slaughter.\n\nVICE Reports headed to Yulin this year to get to the bottom of the most controversial festival in China.\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice", "title": "Dining on Dogs in Yulin: VICE Reports (Trailer)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-07T15:13:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "5fNrIg2pxd8", "description": "Amazing stuff, Every day @ http://www.Streakr.com", "title": "Card Packing In China", "publishedDate": "2010-09-14T21:40:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "5fO6mVfIXwg", "description": "This is Elegant Compass Application with Location Services.

Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\n\n6But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n\n7But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\n\n8Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.\n\n9After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\n\n10Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\n\n11Give us this day our daily bread.\n\n12And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\n\n13And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.

The creative process was documented on film.\n\nThe piece is an evolution of Mendoza's work that incorporates different styles and techniques in painting and drawing - the culmination of Mendoza's 15 years of experimentation applying materials to convey light, texture, linear perspective, space and rhythm. Intermixing transparent and opaque materials, Mendoza has achieved a layered affect that is charged with energy and depth. Mendoza is inspired by science, nature and history and  \"Indelible Light Mechanism\" synthesizes those elements into an electric ecosystem.\n\nFor four months, Mendoza visited the Overthinking space at night to work on the triptych. Each morning the canvases (three 5' x 5' panels) were transformed, revealing an active process which was captured by George Christopher of Flying Pyramids. The music, a modern interpretation of the songbook standard, \"Ain't No Sunshine\", is \"Sunshine\" by Ror-Shak (DB Burkeman & Shaun Morris).", "title": "Christian Mendoza, Indelible Light Mechanism", "publishedDate": "2013-02-01T17:49:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "5fUDIPQepYk", "description": "Jerry Shade, Whitaker & Shade LLC, http://wsattorneys.com - (513) 318-3530.

Like the Common Teal, it is significantly smaller than a Mallard, and tends to favour reedy margins instead of open water.\nAs a result, it has become quite a nice 'tick' for enthusiastic birdwatchers.\n\nThese two ducks were found last week in two separate locales: The National Trust's Wicken Fen reserve in Cambridgeshire and RSPB Lakenheath Fen on the Norfolk/Suffolk border, a little further to the north-east.\nThe Lakenheath pair are almost certainly breeding and nesting somewhere along the nearby river, which is the Little Ouse, a tributary of the East Anglian River Great Ouse.\n\nThe music is a cue from the film 'Less Than Zero', a 1987 film scored by Thomas Newman.\nN.B.

Zusammen mit dem kanadischen Extremskifahrer und Filmemacher Greg Hill geht es Mitte August zum 8188 Meter hohen Cho Oyu in Tibet. Das Ziel des Teams: Die Speedbesteigung des sechsth\u00f6chsten Gipfels der Welt mit anschlie\u00dfender Skiabfahrt ins Basecamp. Ab Mitte August kannst du auf 4-Seasons.TV die komplette Expedition in spannenden Video-Beitr\u00e4gen verfolgen!\n \nGerade mal 24 Stunden Zeit wollen sich die Bergsteiger f\u00fcr den Aufstieg zum 8188 Meter hohen Gipfel vom Basecamp auf 5700 Meter H\u00f6he und die anschlie\u00dfende Skiabfahrt lassen. Dabei verzichten sie bewusst auf k\u00fcnstlichen Sauerstoff und die Zuhilfenahme von Hochtr\u00e4gern. Unterwegs sind sie nur mit minimalem Gep\u00e4ck. Zwei bis drei Liter Wasser und 20-30 Powergels m\u00fcssen f\u00fcr die 24 Stunden reichen. Kein Zelt kann im Notfall als R\u00fcckzugsort dienen. Der absolute Vorteil einer Speedbegehung ist daf\u00fcr die relativ kurze Aufenthaltdauer in der Todeszone!\n \nIm Gegensatz zu Speed-Begehungen sind die meisten Bergsteiger bei ihren Expeditionen nach wie vor im Alpinstil unterwegs: Sie errichten Lagerketten mit mehreren H\u00f6henlagern, in denen sie beim Aufstieg \u00fcbernachten. Der Gep\u00e4ckbedarf erh\u00f6ht sich entsprechend, weil sich die Bergsteiger f\u00fcr 4-5 Tage selbst versorgen m\u00fcssen. \n\nObwohl Speedbergsteigen noch immer eine junge Disziplin des Alpinismus ist, gelten Benedikt B\u00f6hm (34) und Sebastian Haag mit ihren bisherigen Speedbegehungen am Gasherbrum II (8035m) und Mustagh Ata (7546m) und ihren Expeditionen am Manaslu (8136m) und Broad Peak (8051m) schon heute als absolute Profis der Szene.", "title": "Episode 1 - Skiing Cho Oyu in a day (Manaslu Expedition 2012)", "publishedDate": "2012-07-16T13:16:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "5frHHuNfKjE", "description": "This is how to use the binomial distribution using the TI -84 calculator", "title": "Binomial distribution", "publishedDate": "2009-12-04T20:07:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "5frn8TAlew0", "description": "Subscribe to Button!

Atopic eczema, atopic dermatitis, infantile eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, and varicose eczema are but a few of the many types of this skin disorder. The most common type is atopic dermatitis, which is often seen in infants and small children. (Nine out of ten of eczema cases happen in children younger than five years old.) Rarer forms include dyshidrotic eczema, which occurs in warm weather, and nummular eczema, which occurs mostly during winter.\nhttp://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nDuring an eczema flare-up, the person experiences itching and rashes that may be red or brownish, scaly, dry, thick, leathery, crusty or flaky. These may also appear as blisters oozing fluid, or as small, elevated bumps on the skin. In some cases, the skin simply becomes thick, rough and red. When scratched, eczema rashes may be infected, and this can worsen the inflammation. The rashes are often found on the arms, legs, chest, hands, or the face. In children, the rashes typically appear on the cheeks, elbows or knees, especially in skin folds.\n\nEczema is believed to be caused by a hereditary impairment of the immune system. A person with eczema often has family members who also have eczema, asthma or hay fever. The standard treatment is anti-itch topical medications, including anti-histamines. This treatment only relieves the symptoms, and does not cure eczema. There is, in fact, no known cure for eczema. It is a lifelong skin problem that recurs every now and then.\n\nWhile eczema has no cure, there are many management strategies to keep it under control, relieve the itchiness and discomfort, and prolong the time between recurrences. Besides medicinal anti-itch lotions, there too are eczema home remedies and skin care measures that can be used to manage eczema effectively.\n\nEczema home remedies include herbs and natural ingredients that can be made into lotions, pastes or ointments, and then applied on the rashes or affected skin areas. They are proven effective in providing relief from itching and inflammation. The herbal ingredients that may be used include virgin coconut oil, blueberry leaves, mashed papaya seeds, licorice, dandelion leaves, turmeric powder, bitter neem leaves, chamomile, camphor, aloe vera, spearmint leaves, witch hazel and nutmeg. \n\nhttp://www.VanishEczema.net\neczema\nAlternative treatments\ntreatments\nmoisturisers\nmoisturising soap substitutes\nitching\nscratching\nbarrier function\ntopical corticosteroids\ninflammation\nflare-ups of eczema\nInflammation\ndry skin\nLichenification\nantimicrobial medicines\ninfection\nimmunosuppressant medicines\nGamolenic acid\nevening primros extract\nTraditional Chinese herbal medicines\nChinese medicine\nUVB light therapy\nPUVA\npsoralen", "title": "Eczema Skin Care - Coping With Itching, Patches and Redness", "publishedDate": "2014-02-10T13:45:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "5fv3_Dpf_6E", "description": "", "title": "Generic Antiepileptic Drugs and Branded Antiepileptic Drugs", "publishedDate": "2014-06-16T08:17:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "5fvJOSLaAqE", "description": "FEED!

According to a Toledo police report, she loves them so much that when she found out a local McDonald's was not serving them at 6:30 AM (that's breakfast menu time, sister), she became outraged and punched the drive-thru attendant. When a manager came to help, and affirm that there were in fact no chicken McNuggets, she too was on the receiving end of a haymaker. And finally, to really drive home her point, Dushane punched through the glass window.\n\nDushane was arrested after being treated for injuries. The McDonald's employees did not report any injuries to police and will be serving McNuggets promptly at 11 AM. \n\nOn the Grand Jury: A Lucas County grand jury has indicted Melodi Dushane, who allegedly punched out the drive-thru window at a McDonald's restaurant in Toledo's east end Jan. 1 because she didn't get what she wanted.\n\nThe grand jury indicted her on a vandalism charge. Dushane claimed she was drunk at the time of the incident and received a 60-days jail. She has also been ordered to pay the fast food chain the cost of the broken window.\n\nDushane also entered a not guilty plea Thursday morning in Toledo Municipal Court to one count of vandalism and two counts of assault.\n\nToledo police said she got upset at the McDonald's on Main and Front streets when they didn't serve chicken nuggets.

That was before we had a record contract. The version on this record is pretty different. A lot of people asked us why we didn't put it on the first album. But we felt because it was on Metal For Muthas we didn't want to put it on the first album. By the time we did Killers we weren't happy with that version so so we wanted to record it properly. The guitar frills around the vocals were from Adrian. Originally they weren't there but when Adrian joined the band he decided to put them in. '' (Steve Harris)\n\nThis is the classic track from Killers...It's catchy and accessible, and was originally recorded on the  Metal For Muthas compilation, which might be why it wasn't included on the previous album. It is about an angry young man searching for his unknown father, presumably with violent intentions. Nice bass intro too. ''\n\n'Killers' is the second album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released on February 2, 1981 in the UK, and June, 1981 in the US. The album was the first of their albums to feature guitarist  Adrian Smith, and the last to feature vocalist Paul Di'Anno, who was fired from the band mid-tour due to problems with alcohol  and cocaine.

In this paper, we summarize previous evidence from rats, and present new data for rat, mouse and the marsupial grey short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica) showing that whisking in all three species is actively controlled both with respect to movement of the animal's body and relative to environmental structure. Using automatic whisker tracking, and Fourier analysis, we first show that the whisking motion of the mystacial vibrissae, in the horizontal plane, can be approximated as a blend of two sinusoids at the fundamental frequency (mean 8.5, 11.3 and 7.3 Hz in rat, mouse and opossum, respectively) and its second harmonic. The oscillation at the second harmonic is particularly strong in mouse (around 22 Hz) consistent with previous reports of fast whisking in that species. In all three species, we found evidence of asymmetric whisking during head turning and following unilateral object contacts consistent with active control of whisker movement. We propose that the presence of active vibrissal touch in both rodents and marsupials suggests that this behavioural capacity emerged at an early stage in the evolution of therian mammals. \n\nData Supplement - Video\n1) An example of contact-induced asymmetry in a rat (CIA-Rat) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMHuMhEzGWI\n\n2) An example of regular whisking with a strong second harmonic in mouse (RW-mouse)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WUw7AGlAcg\n\nFonte: RoyalSociety \nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalSociety", "title": "CIA-Rat - An example of contact-induced asymmetry in a rat", "publishedDate": "2011-11-13T21:04:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "5gLNqR0HjQQ", "description": "*English subtitles are available.\n(Please click on 'CC' button or activate 'Interactive Transcript' function)\n\n:: iTunes DL : https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/silhda-hate-single/id591296548\n\nBallad Goddess 'Baek Ji Young's' worked with Yiruma, the famous concert musician to make her single 'Hate'.

That is because the former Cactus Itty Bittys, Avery, Brooklyn, and Kassidy met at the Cactus Theater in Lubbock, Texas five years ago. Their parents knew they each loved music and had beautiful voices, so they introduced them to the theater. They quickly fell in love with the musicians and performers they now call their \"Cactus Family\" and the exciting world of entertainment they found. At the Cactus, they discovered an amazing singing program for kids called Terri Caldwell Music. Their vocal teachers were immediately impressed by their talent and put them in a singing group together. Though they weren't even old enough to start kindergarten, they began performing regularly at the theater and throughout West Texas for audiences as large as 80,000 people.

JOHN\u2019S, NL), October 17, 2014 \u2013 The Royal Newfoundland Constabulary (RNC) is requesting the public\u2019s assistance regarding a break and enter investigation at a commercial business located on Commonwealth Avenue in Mt. Pearl, NL.\n\nOn Saturday, May 11, 2013 at approximately 3:10 am RNC officers from Patrol Services Division, Police Dog Services and Forensic Identification Section responded to the Orange Store on Commonwealth Avenue to a report of an alarm. Upon arrival it was determined that entry had been gained into the business. Two males entered the business and left with an undisclosed amount of beer. \n\nThe RNC Criminal Investigation Division is continuing to investigate this offence and is seeking the assistance of the general public. Investigators are asking anyone with information in relation to this break, enter and theft to contact the RNC at 729-8000 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).

Abductees sometimes claim to have been warned against environmental abuse and the dangers of nuclear weapons.  Consequently, while many of these purported encounters are described as terrifying, some have been viewed as pleasurable or transformative.\n \nDue to a lack of any substantial physical evidence, most scientists and mental health professionals dismiss the phenomenon as \"deception, suggestibility (fantasy-proneness, hypnotizability, false-memory syndrome), personality, sleep phenomena, psychopathology, psychodynamics [and] environmental factors.\" Skeptic Robert Sheaffer also sees similarity between the aliens depicted in early science fiction films, in particular, Invaders From Mars, and those reported to have actually abducted people.\n \nThe first alien abduction claim to be widely publicized was the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961.  Reports of the abduction phenomenon have been made around the world, but are most common in English speaking countries, especially the United States.  The contents of the abduction narrative often seem to vary with the home culture of the alleged abductee.\n \nAlien abductions have been the subject of conspiracy theories and science fiction storylines (notably The X-Files) which have speculated on stealth technology required if the phenomenon were real, the motivations for secrecy and that alien implants could be a possible form of physical evidence.", "title": "Alien Caught on Tape!", "publishedDate": "2012-02-09T02:53:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "5gP2tZN99fg", "description": "JOIN and LIKE the page : https://www.facebook.com/pages/Flinges-Entertainment/1467805860172758\n\nFollow on FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/bobo.essien\n\nFor Educational Purposes Only.", "title": "X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST \u2551 Plane Scene (2014) \u1d34\u1d30", "publishedDate": "2014-08-18T09:53:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "5gQ12_f99WY", "description": "Listen and write the vowels down in the order, in which I pronounce them.", "title": "Vowel exercise", "publishedDate": "2013-08-17T08:15:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "5gQTOJgtXQk", "description": "Un nuevo cap\u00edtulo se suma a la teleserie financiera, entre Argentina y los \"fondos buitre\", desde que el juez estadounidense Thomas Griesa declar\u00f3 al pa\u00eds en \"desacato\" por desobedecer su sentencia.\n\nSuscr\u00edbete a nuestro canal en YouTube: http://bit.ly/15NWkSN\n\nDale a \"Me gusta\" en Facebook: http://Facebook.com/cnnee\nS\u00edguenos en Twitter: http://Twitter.com/cnnee\nCNN en Espa\u00f1ol en Pinterest: http://Pinterest.com/cnnee\nCNN en Espa\u00f1ol en Google+: https://plus.google.com/+CNNEE\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/cnneee\nCNN en Espa\u00f1ol en Instagram: http://instagram.com/cnnee", "title": "\u00bfQu\u00e9 dice Argentina del \"desacato\"?", "publishedDate": "2014-10-01T17:53:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "5gQiRdh9Sac", "description": "CHECK OUT THE NEW 210 GALLON!!!    http://youtu.be/m1smluIbb2k\n\n22\" arowana eating a mouse then oscars eating some goldfish\nsilver arowana, red, tiger, albino oscars\nthis is my freshwater tank that is 125 gallons.(since recording this video the tank has been upgraded to 210 gallons)\nThis arowana is very large, he eats about 10 extra large goldfish a week.\nThe oscars have also eaten mice in the past.\nTheir diet consists of food pellets, goldfish, frogs, mice, pinkies, and also sometimes birds (video coming soon) aruanas,  \narawanas, aruana, arawana\nare freshwater bony fish of the family Osteoglossidae, sometimes known as \"bony tongues.\" In this family of fishes, the head is bony and the elongate body is covered by large, heavy scales, with a mosaic pattern of canals. The dorsal and the anal fins have soft rays and are long based, while the pectoral and ventral fins are small. The name 'bony tongues' is derived from a toothed bone on the floor of the mouth, the 'tongue', equipped with teeth that bite against teeth on the roof of the mouth. The fish can obtain oxygen from air by sucking it into the swim bladder, which is lined with capillaries like lung tissue. The arapaima is an \"obligatory air breather\"\nThe family contains two subfamilies, Heterotidinae and Osteoglossinae, with all but two of the ten extant species being members of the latter. Species are given with one or more prominent common names.\n\n    * Subfamily Heterotidinae\n          o Genus Arapaima\n                + Arapaima or pirarucu, Arapaima gigas (Cuvier, 1829)\n          o Genus Heterotis\n                + African arowana, Heterotis niloticus (Cuvier, 1829)\n    * Subfamily Osteoglossinae\n          o Genus Osteoglossum (Cuvier, 1829)\n                + Silver arowana, Osteoglossum bicirrhosum (Cuvier, 1829)\n                + Black arowana, Osteoglossum ferreirai Kanazawa, 1966\n          o Genus Scleropages\n                + Red-tailed golden arowana Scleropages aureus \u2020 (Pouyad, Sudarto & Teugels, 2003)\n                + Green arowana or gold crossback arowana, Scleropages formosus \u2020 (Schlegel & M\u00fcller, 1844)\n                + Gulf saratoga, red saratoga or northern spotted barramundi, Scleropages jardinii \u2021 (Saville-Kent, 1892)\n                + Red arowana, super red arowana, or chili red arowana, Scleropages legendrei \u2020 (Pouyad, Sudarto & Teugels, 2003)\n                + Saratoga, silver saratoga or spotted barramundi, Scleropages leichardti \u2021 G\u00fcnther, 1864\n                + Silver Asian arowana, Scleropages macrocephalus \u2020 (Pouyad, Sudarto & Teugels, 2003)\n\u2020This species is one of several known also as the Asian arowana or Asian bonytongue.\n\u2021This species is one of two sometimes called the Australian arowana or Australian bonytongue.\nArowanas tend to merge in groups of 5 to 8; any fewer may show an excess of dominance and aggression. Keep this fish in a minimum of about 750 litres (240 gallons)for a single fish with good filtration, add another 100 for every other fish kept. This fish should not be purchased by an amateur fish hobbyist. Some compatible fish to partner with this fish are clown knifefish, pacu, oscars, plecostomus, jaguar cichlids, green terrors, gar and any other semi-aggressive fish that cannot fit in the arowana's mouth.\nAustralian species should be kept singly in aquaria\nOsteoglossids are carnivorous, often being specialized surface feeders. They are excellent jumpers; it has been reported that Osteoglossum species have been seen leaping more than 6 feet (almost 2 metres) from the water surface to pick off insects and birds from overhanging branches in South America, hence the nickname \"water monkeys\". Arowanas have been rumored to capture prey as large as low flying bats and small birds. All species are large, and the arapaima is a contender for the world's largest freshwater fish title. Arowana typically grow around 3 to 4 feet, but this is only accountable in captivity.\nSeveral species of osteoglossid exhibit extensive parental care. They build nests and protect the young after they hatch. Some species are mouth brooders, the parents holding sometimes hundreds of eggs in their mouths. The young may make several tentative trips outside the parent's mouth crazy to investigate the surroundings before leaving permanently.fish eating mice awesome intense monster arowana arowana arowana arowana", "title": "22\" Arowana Eating Mouse 12\" Oscars eating goldfish", "publishedDate": "2008-04-02T23:22:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "5gR-51-Q4CE", "description": "buy this song for $0.15 only at http://mp3mart.net Brian Culbertson - Fly High Brian Culbertson - Fly High Brian Culbertson - Fly High", "title": "Brian Culbertson - Fly High", "publishedDate": "2010-06-17T11:47:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "5gR2qDqieD8", "description": "Listen to \"The Divine Infection\" track 5 from Infamous, available now at Hot Topic, Best Buy, FYE, and iTunes: http://smarturl.it/Infamous\n\nStay connected with Motionless In White:\nhttp://motionlessinwhite.net\nhttp://facebook.com/motionlessinwhite\nhttp://twitter.com/MIWband\n\nLYRICS:\nYou don't need a disclaimer,\u00a0you're not really famous\nSo get your fucking chin outta the sky\nI will never stop till i'm on top\nCreate a new diversion\nVirgins begging for a hit with original style.\n\nI don't need a disclaimer to get into heaven\nI know i've made mistakes, i don't need to be saved\nHolyness is fucking televised\nFakers profiteering\nPioneer a new \"religion\" stealing money \"for god\"\n\nCrossed out\nWrists bound\nEverybody get down\nCome on and get me,\u00a0come on and get me \u00a0\n\nBlacked out\u00a0\nGhost town\nLight it up and burn it down\nYou wanna blame me? you never met me\n\nOn your knees\nJust a slave to a god of nothing\ntry and judge me\n(i'll) tie that rope around your neck and kick your throne out \n\nFuck you\n\nyou don't need a disclaimer, you're not really famous\nso get your fucking nose out of my life\nunprotected sex confession\nsharing needles at the alter\u00a0\nfather, fucking little kids, makes you holier than thou\n\nAlmost every major issue I see that faces opposition in the world today, is a product of religious bigotry or criminal intent in the name of God.\u00a0Who the fuck are you to tell me what I can and can't do or say?

The Book of Daniel tells us in chapter 2 that king Nebuchadnezzar had a dream about an enormous statue, but none of his wise men could tell the king what the dream was, or what it meant.\nIn the second year of his reign, king Nebuchadnezzar had dreams, his mind was troubled and he could not sleep (Daniel 2:1). So the king summoned all his wise men to tell him what he had dreamed (Daniel 2:2). The king said to the wise men \"If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble\" (Daniel 2:5). \"But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honour. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me\" (Daniel 2:6). The wise men said \"There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks!\" (Daniel 2:10). This made the king furious and he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon (Daniel 2:12). Daniel went to the king and asked him for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him (Daniel 2:16). Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah (Daniel 2:17). He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon  (Daniel 2:18). During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven (Daniel 2:19). Daniel then went with Arioch to the king and Daniel said \"You looked, oh king, and there before you stood a large statue, an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance\" (Daniel 2:31). \"The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze\" (Daniel 2:32), \"its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay\" (Daniel 2:33). \"While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue at its feet of iron and clay and smashed them\" (Daniel 2:34). \"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time. The rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth\" (Daniel 2:35). \"This was the dream and now we will interpret it to the king\" (Daniel 2:36). \"You, oh king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory (Daniel 2:37). \"You are that head of gold\" (Daniel 2:38). \"After you, other kingdoms will come and rule over the whole earth\" (Daniel 2:39). \"In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed. It will crush all those kingdoms, but it will endure for ever\" (Daniel 2:44). \"This is the meaning of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands, a rock that broke the statue to pieces. The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy\"  (Daniel 2:45).\nThought for today: be in partnership with God, and your future is assured.\nThought for the future: one of God's greatest presents, is His presence in our life.

Since its inception, the NSA has been responsible for the collection and analysis of foreign communications and signal intelligence. An international network of intelligence agencies dubbed Echelon routed data back to NSA during the Cold War, doing high-tech battle with the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union crumbled, the NSA instated Second Echelon which focused entirely on communications technology and the passive collection of intel worldwide, but the branch could not keep up and was ultimately ineffective. \n\nThe NSA began to focus more on fighting wars on the digital front and in response to the evolution communications technology, the NSA instituted Third Echelon. Third Echelon intended to train agents to operate alone in the field with the goal to produce the ultimate intelligence gathering force, dubbed the Splinter Cell Program, and was initially conceived with a single field operative in mind: Sam Fisher.\n\nSam Fisher, a highly experienced and respected covert agent, operated in the CIA and Navy Seals before joining Third Echelon. Recruited by Third Echelon Director Irving Lambert to spearhead the Splinter Cell program, Sam Fisher is granted the Fifth Freedom, the implicit right to do whatever it takes to protect America.\n\nHave fun!\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nWho is Polaris? http://bit.ly/14Z6vUP\n\nWant more from Polaris?\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/12ecJOw\nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/12Ue00n\nGoogle+: http://bit.ly/16l2toB\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/1aiOYgZ\nTumblr: http://bit.ly/13HgrW4\n\nThanks for watching Lore!", "title": "LORE - Splinter Cell Lore in a Minute!", "publishedDate": "2013-09-23T18:13:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "5gi37Jh5imI", "description": "HO Scale Trains, Custom Kato SD40-2 locomotives done by BradleyDCC pulling loaded cars done by Protoloads.com on the Seaboard Central Model Railroad", "title": "New Power for The Seaboard Central done by BradleyDCC!", "publishedDate": "2014-07-07T01:51:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "5giWCiaEtJg", "description": "After at least six days with its head stuck in a plastic pumpkin bucket, a deer has been freed -- by a man who tackled it.

The plan, announced on Tuesday morning, seeks to correct some of the disparities that exist among the city\u2019s more than 1,700 parks and playgrounds, in which high-profile parks in larger neighborhoods have received billions of dollars, while smaller, less visible sites have languished. To choose the sites, the parks department looked for the most neglected, identifying 215 parks where less than $250,000 had been spent on capital improvements over the last 20 years.     Mayor de Blasio laid part of the blame for the inequity in the park system on his predecessor, Mayor Michael R.  Bloomberg, who is perhaps best known for supporting sleek new parks like the High Line and Brooklyn Bridge Park, as well as big-ticket renovations like that of Washington Square Park. But the Bloomberg administration also financed renovations in working- and middle-class neighborhoods throughout the city.  And, in fact, $80 million of the $130 million in the new plan was allotted specifically to neighborhood parks in Mr.  Bloomberg\u2019s preliminary 2015 budget, released shortly before he left office. Many of the smallest parks in the system were overlooked in the past decade, however.  One reason was the parks department\u2019s reliance on City Council members to pay for projects like dog runs, playgrounds and handball courts out of their discretionary funds.  Some gave generously to parks; others did not. The equity plan does not include a contribution from conservancies \u2014 private groups that raise money and sometimes help operate the parks.  The mayor had endorsed state legislation during his campaign that would have required the biggest conservancies to give 20 percent of their operating budgets to a neighborhood parks alliance. But the legislation never came up for a vote in Albany, and the conservancies balked at the idea, saying it would dampen donations.  At the news conference, Mr.  de Blasio said that the city would continue to address the role of conservancies. \u201cToday is a first step,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe will also turn to the major parks conservancies and ask them to make a contribution as part of this process. \u201d", "title": "Correction Seen After Years of Disinvestment in Neighborhood Parks", "publishedDate": "2014-10-08T15:55:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "5gn4KdFwuMQ", "description": "Learn more about Conservative War Chest by visiting: www.conservativewarchest.com", "title": "Conservative War Chest \"Gang Of Five\" - Pryor", "publishedDate": "2014-09-02T14:50:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "5gn9vZIEsbY", "description": "Un Melanerpes aurifrons en el nido que hizo en un \u00e1rbol.", "title": "Melanerpes Aurifrons.", "publishedDate": "2012-05-22T03:39:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "5go5uFVzPdU", "description": "The one where Plum falls out of the car.\n\nSee more http://www.collegehumor.com\nLIKE us on: http://www.facebook.com/collegehumor\nFOLLOW us on: http://www.twitter.com/collegehumor\nFOLLOW us on: http://www.collegehumor.tumblr.com", "title": "Precious Plum: Hitchhiking (Ep. 2)", "publishedDate": "2013-06-06T16:43:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "5goHP8IptEA", "description": "so leute das ist mein erstes tutorial ich hoffe es gef\u00e4llt euch und sry wegen der schlechte qually \nw\u00fcrd mcih \u00fcber komentare freuen", "title": "minecraft tutorial wie baut man eine toilette", "publishedDate": "2012-01-19T18:21:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "5goWZiy6As0", "description": "A bunch of silica gel in a plastic container, with foil lined around the inside edges.

This all happened just four months after he met his now-wife, Michelle Johnson, and the two stayed together, with Joey proposing in April 2013 and the couple getting married on on June 28, 2014 - the day before both their birthdays. He had to learn a different way of life with him and his chair: from showering, getting dressed and trying to function every day,' explained Michelle. 'But we are soul mates.'

The sophistication he brings to these tracks is the mark of true quality. His delivery and phrasing are impeccable, and his choice of material and collaborators are strategic and brilliant.\n\nThe title track was a No. 1 hit on reggae charts last summer, evidence that Maxi Priest has a gift for staying fresh. The song features the legendary Jamaican drum and bass duo Sly & Robbie, who've played on some of Maxi's biggest hits, including \"Wild World,\" \"Some Guys Have All The Luck,\" \"Close To You,\" and \"Housecall\" (featuring Shabba Ranks) as well as the new album track \"Every Little Thing.\" WATCH \"Easy To Love\" video.\n\nMaxi's been tugging on women's heartstrings ever since the mid-80\u2032s. New and long-term fans alike will relish hearing irresistible tributes of enduring affection like \"Loving You Is Easy,\" \"Holiday,\" \"Still In Love,\" and \"Gravity.\" The soulful \"Without A Woman\" features Jamaican legend Beres Hammond and even echoes the themes and intensity of James Brown's \"It's A Man's Man's Man's World.\"\n\nThere are many more highlights on Easy To Love. While \"Hearts Across The World\" is a song for our times and pleas for people of all races to love one another, other tracks like \"Fire In The Skies\" simply defy categorization and are living proof of Maxi Priest's musical versatility. The delicate, aching need of \"Angel Wings\" also demonstrates just how far reggae has evolved in the new era.", "title": "Maxi Priest - Bubble My Way ft.

In this video I wanna show you, how you can craft this item and some of the stuff you can use it for.\n\nTo use a carrot on a stick, the player must first saddle the pig. The pig will then move in the direction that the carrot on a stick points to. To make the pig run faster the player can right click while holding the Carrot on a stick.[1] It is not possible to have the pig swim into water. Hitting the pig will make it move randomly as if it were hurt. Also, if the player holds a carrot on a stick, all pigs (saddled or not) will follow the player (replacing wheat as the breeding item). Pigs can climb ladders and vines allowing for vertical movement besides jumping. The player can ride pigs through portals. The pigs will slowly eat the carrot, evetually leaving you with a fishing rod. You'll have to re-craft the carrot on a stick before controlling the pig again.\nhttp://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Carrot_on_a_Stick\n\n~ FOLLOW ME & SUBSCRIBE:\n\u25cf Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/ToloDK\n\u25cf Twitter: https://twitter.com/#!/ToloGaming\n\u25cf YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/ToloDK\n\u25cf Livestream: http://www.twitch.tv/ToloDK", "title": "Minecraft - Carrot on a Stick", "publishedDate": "2012-10-25T14:37:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "5gtTkZd4zI4", "description": "Created by Avid Studio App", "title": "Robbie Verbosity 1", "publishedDate": "2014-04-20T02:19:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "5guIAaOrMhk", "description": "Micron's Automata Processor (AP) is a programmable silicon device, capable of performing high-speed, comprehensive search and analysis of complex, unstructured data streams.

Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.\nA strong indicator of physical beauty is \"averageness\", or \"koinophilia\".When images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image, they become progressively closer to the \"ideal\" image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when Francis Galton, cousin of Charles Darwin, overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images.", "title": "PERFECTLY PRETTY PATTERNS", "publishedDate": "2013-08-13T20:35:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "5gyZ_BFPys0", "description": "Cobweb Spinner by Specter Factory is available at SpecterFactory.com or eBay.com\n\nI will be uploading other scenarios on how the Cobweb Spinner can be used at a later date.", "title": "Working The Cobweb Spinner By Specter Factory", "publishedDate": "2013-05-30T21:54:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "5gyfclsNBc8", "description": "http://www.simplexityhealth.com/jamesthomas\nWhole In One....

This causes the TM to vibrate.\nFunctions of Middle Ear :- The middle ear is an air filled cavity in the temporal bone which opens via the eustachian tube into the nasopharynx. The auditory tube opens during chewing, swallowing and yawning thus keeping the pressures on both sides of the tympanic membrane equal. The three auditory ossicles are localised in the middle ear. Of these, the malleus is attached to the TM, and the stapes to the membranous oval window on the medial wall. Incus articulates with these two bones. Thus vibrations of the TM are transmitted to the oval window. As the TM has an area of 90mm2 and the foot plate of the stapes 3.2mm2 and the lever system formed by the ossicles multiplies the force 1.3 times.\nThe vibrations of the oval window generate pressure waves in the fluid filling the vestibular canal. The pressure waves pass to the median canal and vibrate the basilar membrane. The tympanic canal is connected to a circular membrane called the round window just beneath the oval window. This arragement allows the pressure waves to transmit through the cochlear fluid.\nFunctions of Cochlea :- The inner ear (labyrinth) is made up of the cochlea and the vestibule. The cochlear portion of the labyrinth is a tubule coiled 2.75 times. Throughout its length the cochlea is divided into three compartments by the basilar and the Reissner's membranes. The middle compartment (scala media) contains endolymph and the other two (scala vestibuli & scala tympani) contain perilymph.\nOrgan of Corti :\nLocated on the basilar membrane is the Organ of Corti which contains the auditory receptors. Four rows of hair cells arise from the basilar membrane.\nwww.edufine.net", "title": "The Ear !!! - About the Ear !!! - Mechanism of Hearing", "publishedDate": "2012-11-02T05:50:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "5h7adol1OjY", "description": "none but ourselves can free our minds", "title": "emancipate yourself from mental slavery", "publishedDate": "2011-06-27T01:59:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "5h7cn1iQh5Q", "description": "2008-2013 ABRSM Flute Grade 4 B8 \nCarthorse Rag No.28 from The Microjazz Collection 2\n\u9577\u7b1b\u6559\u5ba4(\u8343\u7063) \u6b61\u8fce\u8a66\u5802 6212 2332", "title": "ABRSM flute Grade 4 B8 Carthorse Rag", "publishedDate": "2013-01-22T04:43:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "5h7kQFPRVH8", "description": "Um pouco do meu dia na faculdade.

The symptoms of this are characterised when a child who has an ability to communicate verbally does not. Often the child will have to be coaxed and encouraged into making any communication at all, such as gesturing, pointing or signing.\n\nAs the mutism is selective there are certain context where the child chooses not to communicate - such as at school or with particular family members. This can be really frustrating for everyone concerned as it may appear to parents as though child is just being difficult or stubborn.  To teachers or others who fail to hear the child speaking, they maybe concerned about the child's level of understanding and development. There may also be frustration here if the child is choosing to talk to other children but remains selectively mute around adults.\n\nThe very first child therapy client  that I worked with who had selective mutism was a little girl who attended my nursery a couple of afternoons each week. Back then I had never heard of selective mutism so just assumed she was being s stubborn little so and so! As such my reaction to her \"condition\" was to be as persistent as possible With the belief that I would at some point get her talking.  I did! And looking back now, there were a few key elements that made it happen.\n\nThe first thing is was the use of quiet persistence. I say quiet persistence because my tactic was not to give up on speaking to her but equally to avoid making a fuss about the fact she wasn't responding.\n\nThe second thing was to build rapport. I would often play alongside her and be chatting away even though she wouldn't engage with me. The message I was giving her by doing this was that it was a safe environment and that she could be comfortable around me. It was also important that she viewed me as equal to her rather than the big looming adult.\n\nThe third thing was giving it time. As a result of taking things at her pace there was no pressure for her to \"perform.\" We worked within her time frames so that she was doing things at the rate and speed with which she felt most comfortable.\n\nThe fourth thing (which was the turning point) was to talk to her about something which was so familiar to her, she couldn't stop herself from responding. With her, I stumbled across this quite by accident when at tea time she was refusing to sit with the other children who were all eating beans on toast. I went and sat next to her and started rambling. I started saying \"I had baked beans at lunch today but my ones had the little sausages in them I don't know if you've had those before my mum gets the tins from Sainsburys but not everyone's mum goes to Sainsburys, some mums go to the other shops like Asda or-\"\nAt this point she gave me the biggest ever surprise and spoke. She said \"My mum goes to Tescos\"\n\nIt was as if the whole room gasped and went silent! No one had ever heard her speak before. I really felt it was important to not make a fuss about the fact she had started to speak and so I simply added to her comment by explaining that my mum only ever went to Tescos if Sainsburys didn't have all the stuff on her shopping list.\n\nAnd she added to that. We carried on from there and we never mentioned the fact that for the first few months at nursery, she had never spoken. She went from mute, to shy, to being one of the loudest in the group!\n\nhttp://www.NLP4Kids.org Find out more about NLP4Kids and our work with children, teenagers and young people or how you can get free NLP practitioner training when you join our team!", "title": "Child Therapy - Selective Mutism", "publishedDate": "2012-05-13T08:24:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "5hBSXmlez9M", "description": "Chic's Nile Rodgers tells Alex Rawls of MySpiltMilk.com about plans for the opening night of the Essence Music Festival 2014 in New Orleans.

Paul Vernon, commanding officer of the Central Detective Division.  \"As you can see in the video, the use of pepper spray has become a common tactic.\"\n\nThe robbery occurred at the 21st Century Jewelry store on June 22, must before 1 PM.  The three suspects were 5'9\" to 6'0\" tall and 17 to 20 years old.  They left in a white 4-door Toyota Camry with paper plates.  Police have investigated seven similar robberies along Broadway since late June.\n\nDetectives noted a similar pattern of robberies last summer as well, they and cite the price of gold as a prime motivator for the crimes.\n\nThe one commonality for all these crimes is the suspects are part of South Los Angeles gangs, though no one gang is directing or leading the spree.  \"We think that the word has gotten around that this is somehow easy money, but I'm here to tell everyone, we've put 13 people in jail over the last couple weeks and we'll keep doing that until they realize the pickings aren't so easy,\" Lt. Vernon warned.\n\nDetectives have noted a pattern of similar robberies across the southland.  \"We've have spoken to other agencies from Tustin to Corona to Inglewood,\" Lt. Vernon added.  Detectives have trained officers and business owners to be aware of signs of an impending robbery, based on: the number of persons in a car, suspicious persons looking around a store then leaving;  how suspects are dressed; obscured car license plates; and tools, like hammers.  Police arrested one crew of four men two weeks ago before they could commit the robbery.  They were booked on conspiracy charges.\n\nAnyone with information on this crime is urged to call Central Detectives at 213-972-1251.

From a truly awe inspiring line of beautiful silicone stimulation objects created with incredibly clarity of vision and a tenacious focus on pure, unadulterated pleasure, this vibe is simply unprecedented on all levels, from the sinfully sexy orally-inspired shape to the blissfully silky feel perfectly transmitting toe-curling, back-arching, multi-patterned vibration.\n\nApparently, the designers of the Form 3 did not intend to invoke the tongue during the creation process, but the end result certainly does bring the mouth to mind- a supremely curvy shape features an exceptionally unique concave center that thins out dramatically, forming a deliciously full coverage, sweet-spot surrounding cup effect. Certainly standing out from amidst the average collection, this vibe satiates a unifying desire of many, many woman, providing perfectly targeted, deliciously powerful stimulation to the be-all-end-all of female erogenous zones, the clitoris. Definitely suited to external stimulation pursuits, clitoris aside, that amazingly shaped tip can be placed anywhere.flexing inward or outward with gentle pressure for immeasurably perfect placement, all while transmitting breathtakingly powerful, supremely quiet vibration throughout.\n\nShaped thoughtfully to fit comfortably and securely in hand, the Form 3 boasts a smooth rounded base that can be cupped perfectly in the palm, allowing that incomparably tip to protrude while maneuvering the lightweight, ergonomically conscious shape around and over desired body areas. Completely perfect for couples to share, this vibe is amazingly unobtrusive, fitting seamlessly into an array of positions and acts- of course, it's equally, and impressively well suited to solo play.\n\nExtraordinarily powerful vibration modes take inspiration from universally loved stimulation patterns, featuring constant, pulse, thrum and oscillating versions that, aside from allowing ecstatic customization with pleasure desires, also adjust to  suit intensity yearnings. Four possible speeds of each mode are exquisitely easy to adjust, as are the patterns themselves- an in-built interface at the curvy midpoint quickly cycle through the vibe patterns with a squiggle-symbol button, speed adjustment requires just a touch of the plus/minus panel. A wonderful choice for travel, the Form 2 features a lock mode, entered by simply holding the plus and squiggle button for a few seconds, repeat to unlock.\n\nSpeaking of travel, this vibe, being completely rechargeable, requires only a free electrical outlet to power up, and Jimmyjane has made sure that wherever that outlet is, there's an adapter to suit. Sliding easily over the default plug, adapters for US, UK, AU and EU are included. The Form 3 charges in an upright position on a handy little base, just line up the rounded bottom of the vibe with the base, ensuring that it's positioned correctly (indicator light will glow). A two hour charge will run the Form for up to four continuous hours, depending on mode and intensity used- a built in indicator light will flash slowly in pulses of four to warn of low battery.\n\nMatching the rest of its luxurious features, this vibe is made of a decidedly safe, hypoallergenic and completely blissful-feeling silicone material. Incredibly easy to clean and sterilize, the Form 3 is completely odor and taste free, ideal for even the most sensitive skin. The touch of silicone against the skin is like nothing else, it's both plush and forgiving, with a definite firmness that's deliciously precise.

That was the age when my parents had to sell me to slavery. We resided in a small town governed by King Luther; A vampire. Yes, vampires dominated the town since I could remember. They kept the town in order, and in exchange each family had to give away a daughter at age of 17, it was a sacrifice for having the right to live and breath. Unfortunate, in my family, the daughter was I. I was going to be that sacrifice. All that I could pray for was that it was not a cruel vampire.\n\n\"I'm sorry my dear,\" My mother babbled on the verge of tears.\n\n\"It's okay mom, just take care of my little sister,\" I asked hoarsely, My Little sister was my strongest reason for acceding to this. I didn't want her to suffer, I didn't want my family to suffer; they were good people. They'd always given me the best growing up, knowing there would be one day they would have to give me up.\n\nWe made our way out the house and started off to the slave market; it was all the way in the middle of the town. When we arrived a guard queried which family we were and looked us up on the ledger..\n\n\"Aha the lovato's and this must be your daughter, Demetria,\" My parents and I just nodded \"Well, it says here you're not going to the auction today,\" He said with a absolute tranquility.\n\n\"What do you mean? I'm 17 this day,\" I asked, confused.\n\n\"You're already sold, to our majesty the king; I hear he has been keeping an eye on you since you were about 13. You're to be given to one of his sons, I believe,\" He explained. \"Now follow me\".\n\nI could not believe it, My fate had been decide since I was 13. The king wanted me for one of his sons. This can't be good, I thought. I had heard too much rumors about the king's sons, that they were arrogant, spoiled and definitely cruel. Oh god. I said my goodbyes to my family and followed the guard in a daze.\n\n\nAfter a few minutes of walking through the maze of streets, we arrived...Oh dear lord...I had never seen the Royal Palace before; humans were not permitted anywhere near the Royal territory, unless you were a slave that is. It was resplendent, lush green trees all around, ornate fountains with towering statues. We made our way to a small back door. I ascertained we were not to go in by the front threshold, only royalty could. Still in shock, I followed the guard and focused myself before the kings throne.\n\n\"My Lord,\" the guard bowed reverently. I imitated him. The king was pretty beautiful for his age. He had brown hair and hazel eyes and being a vampire as he was, had skin as white as paper.\n\n\"Oh sweet Demetria, you finally grew up!!!\" He chimed rising from his throne. \"Why you're absolutely beautiful. I must say, the wait was worth it\" He made me nervous. Even with that friendly deposition, I could see cruelness in his eyes that lat beneath. \"Call Joe,\" He demanded and I finally noticed the slave. She immediately went to follow her order.\n\nAs I waited, I got more and more edgy. Joe was one of the king's sons; and obviously he was to be my master. Suddenly a guy appeared from nowhere next to the king.\n\n\"What?!?\" He asked with disinterest, and I knew then that the rumors were true, He was indeed arrogant. He turned and my thoughts came to a halt. He was beautiful, he had dark messy hair and deep black eyes, and his lips looked so soft and rosy. Those lips....Oh god what am I thinking.

You start by pressing the start button on your keyboard or you can also go to the bottom left of your screen and we're going to do a search for recovery here and go to settings and here is an option to create a recovery drive.  When the user account control pops up.  Go ahead & press yes.  And here you will typically going to have a recovery partition that the PC manufacturer offers.  This box will typically be checked.  In my case it's not because I wiped out the recovery partition and loaded a clean installation of Windows 8 not from the manufacturer.  If this box is checked, it will just copy the recovery partition, it's not going to give you an option to create it on a CD if this box is checked or a DVD.  So, you're going to have to uncheck that if you want a generic windows 8 disk.  If you want a windows 8 recovery disk that is from the manufacturer, then you will probably have to use a USB stick.  So, I'm going to go ahead & click next here and now it's going to ask me for a USB flash drive that is at least 256mb and as it says that everything on the drive will be deleted.

It is also called Eurasian Blackbird (especially in North America, to distinguish it from the unrelated New World blackbirds),[2] or simply Blackbird (in areas where it is the only blackbird-like species). It breeds in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand. It has a number of subspecies across its large range; a few of the Asian subspecies are sometimes considered to be full species. Depending on latitude, the Common Blackbird may be resident, partially migratory or fully migratory.\nThe male of the nominate subspecies, which is found throughout most of Europe, is all black except for a yellow eye-ring and bill and has a rich melodious song; the adult female and juvenile have mainly dark brown plumage. This species breeds in woods and gardens, building a neat, mud-lined, cup-shaped nest. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, earthworms, berries, and fruits.\nBoth sexes are territorial on the breeding grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas. Pairs will stay in their territory throughout the year where the climate is sufficiently temperate. This common and conspicuous species has given rise to a number of literary and cultural references, frequently related to its song.\nThe Common Blackbird of the nominate subspecies T. m. merula is 23.5 to 29 centimetres (9.25 to 11.4 in) in length, has a long tail, and weighs 80--125 grammes (2.8 to 4.4 oz). The adult male has glossy black plumage, blackish-brown legs, a yellow eye-ring and an orange-yellow bill. The bill darkens somewhat in winter.[13] The adult female is sooty-brown with a dull yellowish-brownish bill, a brownish-white throat and some weak mottling on the breast. The juvenile is similar to the female, but has pale spots on the upperparts, and the very young juvenile also has a speckled breast. Young birds vary in the shade of brown, with darker birds presumably males.[13] The first year male resembles the adult male, but has a dark bill and weaker eye ring, and its folded wing is brown, rather than black like the body plumage.[6]\nThe Common Blackbird is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, earthworms, seeds and berries. It feeds mainly on the ground, running and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls earthworms from the soil, usually finding them by sight, but sometimes by hearing, and roots through leaf litter for other invertebrates. Small vertebrates such as frogs, tadpoles and lizards are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take berries and collect caterpillars and other active insects.[25] Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall apples and berries taken more in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens. In northern India, banyan and mulberry fruits are frequently eaten, with Erythrina and Trema species featuring further south.[6]\nThe Common Blackbird breeds in temperate Eurasia, North Africa, the Canary Islands, and South Asia. It has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand.[6] Populations are sedentary in the south and west of the range, although northern birds migrate south as far as northern Africa and tropical Asia in winter.[6] Urban males are more likely to overwinter in cooler climes than rural males, an adaptation made feasible by the warmer microclimate and relatively abundant food that allow the birds to establish territories and start reproducing earlier in the year.[24]\nCommon over most of its range in woodland, the Common Blackbird has a preference for deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per hectare (nearly three pairs per acre), with woodland typically holding about a tenth of that density, and open and very built-up habitats even less.[25] They are often replaced by the related Ring Ouzel in areas of higher altitude.[26]\nThe Common Blackbird occurs up to 1000 metres (3300 ft) in Europe, 2300 metres (7590 ft) in North Africa, and at 900--1820 metres (3000--6000 ft) in peninsular India and Sri Lanka, but the large Himalayan subspecies range much higher, with T. m. maximus breeding at 3200--4800 metres (10560--16000 ft) and remaining above 2100 metres (6930 ft) even in winter.[6]\nThis widespread species has occurred as a vagrant in many locations in Eurasia outside its normal range, but records from North America are normally considered to involve escapees, including, for example, the 1971 bird in Quebec.[27] However, a 1994 record from Bonavista, Newfoundland has been accepted as a genuine wild bird,[6] and the species is therefore on the North American list.[28]", "title": "Turdus Merula Singing", "publishedDate": "2010-05-23T11:06:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "5iJg-JkvilQ", "description": "Kurt Seyit ve \u015eura, Uluslararas\u0131 Seul Drama \u00d6d\u00fclleri i\u00e7in yar\u0131\u015f\u0131yor.

Ward\nScreenwriter: John Hughes\nFilm Description: In this cheerful, lightweight comedy, excruciatingly clumsy, disorganized, and messy Uncle Buck Russell (John Candy) becomes the screens most unlikely babysitter since Clifton Webb in Sitting Pretty. While their parents are away, eight-year old Miles (Macaulay Culkin), six-year old Maizy (Gaby Hoffman) and their teen-aged sister, Tia (Jean Kelly) are left in the care of Buck. Surprisingly, the very inept Uncle Buck entertains the younger children who come to love him and earns the respect of Tia when he rescues her from her worthless boyfriend. However, in doing so, Buck nearly loses his long-time girlfriend Chanice (Amy Madigan). John Candy is delightful in the leading role giving a touching and notable comic performance. Directed by John Hughes in his typical broad style, this youth-oriented comedy is perhaps the best role of John Candy's regrettably brief career.\n\n\"uncle buck\",\"uncle buck clip\",\"uncle buck part 1\",\"uncle buck trailer\",\"uncle buck soundtrack\",\"uncle buck clown\",\"uncle buck mole scene\",\"john candy\",\"macaulay culkin\",\"gaby hoffmann\",\"jean louisa kelly\",\"car videos\",comedy,\"family comedies\",\"john hughes\",\"bill brown\",\"ramey e ward\",\"family videos\",\"respect videos\",\"risk videos\",\"high school videos\",\"buck russell\",\"maizy russell\",\"miles russell\",\"tia russell\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++51682,/m/0mfj2,/m/01f5q5,/m/0660zg,/m/0223dv", "title": "Uncle Buck (3/10) Movie CLIP - The Buck-mobile (1989) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T14:45:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ibRiffDwWc", "description": "", "title": "madonnina al tramonto con pescherecci sullo sfondo  15 agosto 2009 santa maria di castellabate", "publishedDate": "2009-08-15T23:30:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ibukrkwqcw", "description": "This remix involved much more trouble than I had hoped, but it seemed to be worth it in the end 8)\n\nDownload: http://pokeremixstudio.floatzel.net/Pokemon%20Remixes/Pokemon%20RSE%20Mt%20Pyre%20Remix.mp3\nRight-click the url and select \"Save ___ As\"\n\nYou can get the image here: http://tomiokajiro.deviantart.com/art/Metagross-133890332", "title": "Pokemon R/S/E Remix: Mt.

How much money do you have? What are your accomplishments? How many girls have you had sex with? (Cont. below..)\n\nI did a followup video on this topic: http://youtu.be/hxsrLAA-Q18 (Definitely check it out, I think this follow up vid is really good.) \n\nHow buff are you? What level of education do you have? How many subscribers do you have on youtube? How sexy are you? How nice is your car, your house, your clothes? How spiritually enlightened are you? And once you think about it.. NONE of that stuff matters.  And the more you buy into that way of thinking, the more you will live life FOR OTHERS, always trying to impress others, rather than living for YOURSELF. There's no reason to impress others. Stop it. Once you start living for yourself, and doing what makes YOU happy.. you will feel fulfilled & alive. That's also when you will find genuine connection in your relationships because you are not trying to impress anyone. You have no \"outcome\". You're not trying to get anything out of life, but just enjoying being in \"the flow\".\n\nAfter the Infinite Waters collab I was thinking- it'd be awesome to film a powerful short video that could really hook all the new subscribers I got to my channel. I went out to film a vid.. and the words wouldn't come to me. And I realized.. wait a second, I'm not making this video because I'm genuinely inspired to, I'm making this video because I want to impress my new subscribers! I had an \"outcome\". I was a slave to my new subs. \n\nI ended up scratching that footage.. and just uploaded a video I enjoyed making (the one w/ Shogo). Even tho it was a long vid and kind of a niche topic.. I was happy making and uploading it because it was what I genuinely wanted to do. I wasn't uploading that vid to impress subscribers, or to try to get more subs.\n\nThe whole point of doing this \"advice channel\" is to live my own advice- which is doing what genuinely inspires up within me & talking about things purely for the reason of: because I love talking about those thing. What makes me itch. \n\nI should never upload a video that I didn't enjoy making, have a good feeling about when after filming, and be proud of. Why? Because I'd be selling out. I'd be doing something for the opinions of others (views, subs, etc.) rather than doing it for the sake of enjoying it.\n\nTONS of youtubers sell out. They make vids based on popular trends to get more views / subs. Or doing whatever it takes to get more views. And before they know it.. yes they might be getting more views & subs & money etc.. but who are they living for? Themselves? Or are they slaves to impressing people? The more you be a slave.. the more you get stuck being a slave as well. And you're rewarded with fame, money, etc.. so it's a dangerous trap. Rather than making vids that YOU love making & are inspired to make from your heart & true passions.\n\nWhat makes you itch? What makes you feel alive? Do your best to do that thing/s as much as you can in life regardless of what others think. And keep doing whatever it takes to revolve ur life around \"what makes you itch\". (might take time & come in waves) You will be fulfilled, internally happy, feel good about yourself, will create connections & relationships that are PERFECT FOR YOU, live a REAL life, and money etc. will come to you eventually cus you're such a passionate person doing what you love and hence become really good at it.\n\nThis is NOT about being selfish. I hope you are a loving and kind person who treats people equally! This is about NOT doing things just to impress people / doing things to get approval. This is about being true to yourself, your passions, and finding what truly makes YOU itch & feel alive! \n\nI realized at first making vids with whatever was a blast. But then the whatever thinking became all business- subscribers. fame. money. & i realized i stopped making the pranks for the sake of making the pranks.. and was turning into a business man. Doing the pranks / picking up girls vids initially made me itch.. but then it became business.. and i stopped enjoying it. and I decided my true \"what makes me itch\" became thinking about all these ideas. I enjoy thinking / talking about stuff like this. It was hard to give up the fame / money of the popular prank channel.. but in my heart I knew it was the right thing to do in order to be true to myself. Perhaps in the future doing pranks / picking up girls will make me itch again.. who knows\n\nHere's an awesome vid by Alan Watts:\nhttp://youtu.be/je3rQevW-cw\n\nSUBSCRIBE!: http://www.youtube.com/user/GoldJacketLuke?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/LukeEilers\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/EilersLuke\nCore Confidence Challenge: http://www.MortenHake.com/CoreConfidenceChallenge\nhttp://www.GoldJacketLuke.com\n\nGraphics By: Pok\u00e9flirt (Funny Pranks) - http://bit.ly/SubscribePF", "title": "How To Impress People", "publishedDate": "2014-02-05T22:38:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "5idzwiqflZw", "description": "While most people are aware of what the ocean smells like, not many know what causes the scent.\n \nAnyone who's been near an ocean has experienced the distinct scent that wafts through the air, but what exactly produces that smell?\n\nAccording to microbiologist Benjamin Wolfe, no single entity within the ocean causes the scent, instead, it's a mixture of different aquatic happenings.  \n\nThree of the primary smell-producing molecules include dimethyl sulfide and bromophenols.  \n\nDimethyl sulfide is produced predominately by bacteria feasting on dying phytoplankton, as well as coral reefs. \n\nFood scientists have likened the smell of dimethyl sulfide to sulfur, boiled cabbage and creamed corn. \n\nDictyopterenes are a type of sex pheromone released by seaweed that not only contributes to the smell of the ocean, but also to how edible seaweed tastes. \n\nAnd last but not least, bromophenols are what give wild seafood, such as fish, shrimp and oysters, their brininess. \n\nIn high concentrations though, bromophenols smell similar to iodine.\n\nSeafood biologists believe it is caused by what the animals eat, such as algae and marine worms, and because of this, farm-raised seafood tastes differently to that caught in the wild.", "title": "Why The Ocean Smells Like The Ocean", "publishedDate": "2014-08-29T05:16:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ieMIK2GaBE", "description": "Luk\u00e1\u0161 Hacek sings 'Luk\u00e1\u0161 Aria' from Bed\u0159ich Smetana's Opera 'THE KISS', accompanied by Richard Pohl.\n(04.06.2013, Divadlo na Orl\u00ed, Brno)\n\n\nLuk\u00e1\u0161:\n\nJ\u00e1 ne\u0161\u0165astn\u00edk!\n\nTo\u0165 Vendulce, to\u0165 za v\u011brnost m\u016fj d\u00edk!?\n\nA pro\u010d? - \u017de p\u0159\u00e1la mrtv\u00e9 v hrob\u011b klid!\n\nV\u017edy\u0165 byl to zbo\u017en\u00fd, dobr\u00fd, svat\u00fd cit,\n\na vzpurnost moje zpozdil\u00e1,\n\nto zlat\u00e9 srdce zranila!\n\n\nKdybych v\u011bd\u011bl, jak svou vinu sm\u00fdt,\n\n\u017ehav\u00fdm ohn\u011bm cht\u011bl bych za to j\u00edt;\n\nhory obm\u011bk\u010dil bych slzami,\n\nhv\u011bzdy p\u0159imodlil bych ku zemi.\n\nKdyby o m\u00e9m \u017ealu zv\u011bd\u011bla,\n\n\u017eal snad usm\u00ed\u0159\u00ed hn\u011bv and\u011bla!\n\nA m\u00e1 du\u0161e z r\u00e1je vyhnan\u00e1\n\npozn\u00e1 snad, \u017ee p\u0159ec m\u011b r\u00e1da m\u00e1!", "title": "Luk\u00e1\u0161 Hacek - \u00e1ria Luk\u00e1\u0161a z opery Hubi\u010dka (Bed\u0159ich Smetana)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-21T10:53:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ieZoxQ209w", "description": "SPM - Chemistry - Form 4\nChapter 6: Electrochemistry\n- Introduction to electrochemistry", "title": "Introduction to electrochemistry", "publishedDate": "2014-08-27T05:45:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ie_T0avFZw", "description": "The Red-wattled Lapwing (Vanellus indicus) is a lapwing or large plover, a wader in the family Charadriidae. It has characteristic loud alarm calls which are variously rendered as did he do it or pity to do it leading to colloquial names like the did-he-do-it bird. Usually seen in pairs or small groups not far from water but may form large flocks in the non-breeding season (winter).\nRed-wattled Lapwings are large waders, about 35 cm long. The wings and back are light brown with a purple sheen, but head and chest and front part of neck are black. Prominently white patch runs between these two colours, from belly and tail, flanking the neck to the sides of crown. Short tail is tipped black. A red fleshy wattle in front of each eye, black-tipped red bill, and the long legs are yellow. In flight, prominent white wing bars formed by the white on the secondary coverts.\nRace aigneri is slightly paler and larger than the nominate race and is found in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Indus valley. The nominate race is found all over India. The Sri Lankan race lankae is smaller and dark while atronuchalis the race in north-eastern India and eastern Bangladesh has a white cheek surrounded by black.\nMales and females are similar in plumage but males have a 5% longer wing and tend to have a longer carpal spur. The length of the birds is 320-350mm, wing of 208-247mm with the nominate averaging 223mm, Sri Lanka 217mm. The Bill is 31-36mm and tarsus of 70-83mm. Tail length is 104-128mm.\nIt usually keeps in pairs or trios in well-watered open country, ploughed fields, grazing land, and margins and dry beds of tanks and puddles. They occasionally form large flocks, ranging from 26 to 200 birds.[7] It is also found in forest clearings around rain-filled depressions. It runs about in short spurts and dips forward obliquely (with unflexed legs) to pick up food in a typical plover manner.[8] They are said to feed at night being especially active around the full moon. Is uncannily and ceaselessly vigilant, day or night, and is the first to detect intrusions and raise an alarm, and was therefore considered a nuisance by hunters. Flight rather slow, with deliberate flaps, but capable of remarkable agility when defending nest or being hunted by a hawk.\nIt breeds from West Asia (Iraq, SW Iran, the Arabian/Persian Gulf) eastwards across South Asia (Baluchistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the entire Indian subcontinent up to Kanyakumari and up to 1800m in Kashmir/Nepal), with another sub-species further east in Southeast Asia. May migrate altitudinally in spring and autumn (e.g. in N. Baluchistan or NW Pakistan), and spreads out widely in the monsoons on creation of requisite habitats, but by and large the populations are resident.\nThis species is declining in its western range, but is abundant in much of South Asia, being seen at almost any wetland habitat in its range.\nThe breeding season is mainly March to August. The courtship involves the male puffing its feathers and pointing its beak upwards. The male then shuffles around the female. Several males may display to females and they may be close together. The eggs are laid in a ground scrape or depression sometimes fringed with pebbles, goat or hare droppings. About 3--4 black-blotched buff eggs shaped a bit like a peg-top (pyriform), 42x30 mm on average. Nests are difficult to find since the eggs are cryptically coloured and usually matches the ground pattern. In residential areas, they sometimes take to nesting on roof-tops. They have been recorded nesting on the stones between the rails of a railway track, the adult leaving the nest when trains passed. Nests that have been threatened by agricultural operations have been manually translocated by gradually shifting the eggs. When nesting they will attempt to dive bomb or distract potential predators. Both the male and female incubate the eggs and divert predators using distraction displays or flash their wings to deter any herbivores that threaten the nest. Males appear to relieve the females incubating at the nest particularly towards the hot part of noon. The eggs hatch in 28 to 30 days. The reproductive success is about 40%. Egg mortality is high (~43%) due to predation by mongooses, crows and kites. Chicks had a lower mortality (8.3%) and their survival improved after the first week.\nThe diet of the lapwing includes a range of insects, snails and other invertebrates, mostly picked from the ground. They may also feed on some grains. They feed mainly during the day but they may also feed at night. They may sometimes make use of the legs to disturb insect prey.\nIn parts of India, a local belief is that the bird sleeps on its back with the legs upwards and an associated Hindi metaphor Tithiri se asman thama jayega (\"can the pee-wit support the heavens?\") is used when referring to persons undertaking tasks beyond their ability or strength.", "title": "Air Gun Hunting Of Lapwing Bird Hunting", "publishedDate": "2014-05-29T04:14:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ierXYNp8HQ", "description": "Since after a long time, Volkswagen launched an exclusive Vento in India, called the Vento Preferred Edition.

So Chinna moves into a rough neighborhood that happens to be under the control of the local mafia there. He overpowers the mafia there eventually and becomes a protector for the people there. A clerk in the commissioner\u2019s office (Charmy Kaur) enters as a co-tenant in Chinna's house. Love sprouts between them. However, she mistakenly assumes that Chinna is a soft natured guy. She's unaware of his reputation in that locality nor of his murderous past. Their relationship breaks when she finally discovers the truth about Chinna. How do they get back together?

Astrocytes constitute half of the cells in the brain, and astrocyte processes, the \"arms\" that project outward from the cells, surround the majority of neuronal synapses in the brain. This places them in an ideal location to be actively involved in synapse formation and maintenance and in the modulation of communication between neurons. In fact, in the absence of astrocytes, few functional connections form between developing neurons, while their presence profoundly increases the number of functional synapses.", "title": "Nicola Allen, Neuroscience", "publishedDate": "2012-07-06T21:35:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ina5ufIJnc", "description": "Comcast and Netflix recently struck a deal to ensure better service for Netflix content to users.

Dental changes happen as soon as you put food into your mouth. Every time you eat, bacteria in your mouth help in the digestion process by naturally breaking down food to sugar. All too often, the same mouth-dwelling bacteria are responsible in the conversion of sugar to acid. Food acid, when left in the mouth for prolonged periods of time, is what causes eventual damage to teeth enamel.\n\nDental Checkup in Sunshine Coast: Mouth-Friendly Food Choices\n\nFood choices that best promote dental health include food items that protect teeth enamel from damage. More often than not, these food items provide adequate amounts of calcium and phosphorous. Both calcium and phosphorus are essential in the materialization of tooth enamel. This happens when essential minerals are deposited into the tooth enamel after being affected by food acids. \n\nOther food items that improve dental health include those that have high water content such as crunchy fruits. The high water content of these food items helps dilute food sugars and buffering acids that attack teeth enamel. \n \nDental Checkup in Sunshine Coast: Quality Dental Healthcare in Nambour\n\nKeep your picture perfect smile and maintain long term dental health.
