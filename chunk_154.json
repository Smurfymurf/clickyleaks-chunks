The 11 species of badger are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (9 Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel) and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus european), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae. Badgers include the species in the genera Meles, Arctonyx, Taxidea and Mellivora. Their lower jaws are articulated to the upper by means of transverse condyles firmly locked into long cavities of the skull, so dislocation of the jaw is all but impossible. This enables the badgers to maintain their hold with the utmost tenacity, but limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut, or sliding from side to side without the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most mammals. Badgers have rather short, fat bodies, with short legs for digging. They have elongated weasel-like heads with small ears. Their tails vary in length depending on species; the stink badger has a very short tail, while the ferret badger's tail can be 46--51 cm long, depending on age. They have black faces with distinctive white markings, gray bodies with a light-coloured stripe from head to tail, and dark legs with light coloured stomachs. They grow to around 90 centimetres in length including tail. The European badger is one of the largest; the American badger, the hog badger and the honey badger are generally a little smaller and lighter. The stink badgers are smaller still, and the ferret badgers are the smallest of all. They weigh around on average, with some Eurasian badgers weighing in at around The diet of the Eurasian badger consists largely of earthworms, insects, grubs, and the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds. funny animal animals crazy craziest insane blooper bloopers fail fails dam dams beaver beavers rodent rodents danger dangers rabid rabies disease diseases diseased swim swims swimming swimmer swimmers water waters waterfall waterfalls falls niagra ontario canada cottage cottages country cute cutest cub cubs mice mouse rat rats bite bites attack attacks hunt hunts hunter hunters hunting cook cooking eat eats eating cooks fire trap traps trapping pest pests snare snares fish fishing fisher fishers fisherman fishermen weasels, stoats, ferrets and otters They also eat small mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds, as well as roots and fruit. In Britain, they are the only predator honey rock of hedgehogs, which have demonstrably lower populations in areas where badgers are numerous, so that hedgehog rescue societies will not release hedgehogs into known badger territories. In some areas they are known to predate lambs, and may bite a ewe defending her lamb, almost always leading to infection of the bite. They are occasional predators of domestic chickens, and are able to break into enclosures that a fox cannot. In southern Spain, badgers feed to a significant degree on rabbits. The honey badger of Africa consumes honey, porcupines and even venomous snakes (such as the puff adder); they will climb trees to gain access to honey from bees' nests. American badgers are fossorial carnivores -- i.e. they catch a significant proportion of their food underground, by digging. They can tunnel after ground-dwelling rodents at speed. Badgers have been known to become intoxicated with alcohol after eating rotting fruit. Hunting badgers has been common in many countries. The Dachshund dog breed was bred as a badger hound; Dachs is the German word for badger The blood sport of badger-baiting was outlawed in the United Kingdom by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, and the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 made it a serious offence to kill, injure or take a badger, or to damage or interfere with a sett unless a licence is obtained from a statutory authority. An exemption that allowed fox hunters to loosely block setts to prevent chased foxes escaping into them was brought to an end with the Hunting Act 2004. Badgers can be fierce animals and will protect themselves and their young at all costs, are capable of fighting off dog-packs and fighting off much larger animals, such as wolves and bears. However, badgers can be tamed and then kept as pets Today, badgers are commercially trapped for their pelts, which are used to make shaving brushes and clothing. Badger hair is particularly suited for shaving brushes due to its water retention. Virtually all commercial badger hair comes from mainland China, which supplies knots of hair in three grades to brush makers in both China and Europe. In rural Northern China, badgers multiplied to the point of becoming a crop nuisance, and village cooperatives are licensed by the national government to hunt badgers and process their hair", "title": "Badger Vs Coyote", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T16:09:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "8hyX2Qno974", "description": "Atelectasis", "title": "Discussion Board #2 Part A", "publishedDate": "2013-09-24T09:07:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "8hyc8DfI-Tc", "description": "Recorded on March 7, 2011 using a Flip Video camera.", "title": "\"Dry\" run on the plasma CNC.

Include a minimum of five angles of the live fire demonstrations and the interview, and you end up with a quickly paced illustrative and very informative demonstration of Jerry's techniques and methodology.

She used Cannabis oil in a VAP. Watch and she will explain. \nIn Run From The Cure http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeQPqk... , Rick does mention you need to make about 60 grams of oil, a full pound or more of Cannabis to cure most serious forms of Cancer,, 60 grams to be ingested in total over 2-3 month period, you dont need a full pound upfront, make oil as you go along it you have to. Just Ingest ^0 grams in total. sometimes more sometimes less, but then again if you have left overs take more! Its a protective preventative. for someone with milder illness or disease, sometimes cancer, you can use Shona's method. \n\nThis method will work for most diseases, but not all diseases. BECAUSE:\nthe heat that is needed to release the Cannabinoids from the other molecules and plant material, breaking them down into singular, non carboxyll grouped called Cannabinoids, this conversion is called \"decarboxylation\", before heat, they are known as \"Phytocannabinoids\", and are not the same as Cannabis oil or Cannabinoids, they can not BIND DIRECTLY to all receptors, being the ones in the brain area, that control CB receptors. The brain is shetered by a special covring called the blood brain barrier. This keeps larger molecules like viruses or toxins out of the brain area, Phytocannabinoids are too big to pass through this blood brain barrier, but Cannabinoids are not! \nPhytocannabinoids are larger [THC-A'] and have a different molecular shape then Cannabinoids [THC] and can not get to some of the deep areas in the body that they need to, like behind the Blood Brain Barrier, in the brain. \n....................so for this conversion to happen, decarboxylation, you need to suspend the Phytocannabinoids / Cannabinoids in the heat for a longer period of time, to fully activate ALL of the present Cannabinoids, im not saying this method wont cure a serious form of cancer, it probably won't, but all depends on the individuals health and the cancer, but when battling a fast life threatening disease like cancer, try making the oil if you can.\nVisit our FB page to find out more! https://www.facebook.com/Cannabinoids...\n\nThe VAP smoke might not get as hot as well. A solid temp of 105-110C for the entire extraction boiling away solvent process when making oil, not above these temps not below them, in between 105-110C. \n\nREMEMBER, the more decarboxylated Cannabinoids you have, the faster the healing time. Ingest Cannabis oil, like she is doing in this video, multiple times a day, you must STAY AWAKE DURING THE DAY THOUGH, if one dose causes you to pass out, then you have taken too much! let it ware off and take a smaller dose next time. You may need your daylight.. take that amount as many times a day as you can, and as days pass youll be able to take bigger doses,,.. do this for as long as it takes, for cancer.. in the very end,.. it should take you about 60 grams of Cannabis oil. not that you need the whole 60 grams right in the beginning... 60 in the end should be ingested to CURE some of the most serious diseases like serious forms of cancer. \n\nApply topically for skin cancer, warts, moles, scar tissue, rashes, infections, all skin problems, to cure skin cancer... you only need a bit of oil, to rub on your skin in infected area, for maybe a coupe weeks, skin disease free, for skin cancer, maybe keep putting it on your skin where the cancer was, even after you cant see it... to ensure it stays awaY", "title": "Crohn's Disease Survivor Shona Banda Tells How Medical Marijuana Oil Helps Her  Live Free", "publishedDate": "2013-06-07T18:47:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "8i4fUUhjVd8", "description": "Un saluto a tutti gli studenti dell'universit\u00e0 di Molto in Salita!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NocoldizTV\nCanale secondario: https://www.youtube.com/user/nocoldizR", "title": "L'eredit\u00e0 \u00e8 molto carina", "publishedDate": "2014-08-20T08:30:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "8i5u7_qtuWs", "description": "Disney Queen Elsa goes to MiWorld Sprinkles Cupcake Bakery by AllToyCollector.

Flatulence occurs when gas accumulates in intestinal tract and colon. This is a normal process that occurs when bacteria break down certain types of food.\n\nThe Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus) is one of three recognized subspecies of the Asian elephant and native to mainland Asia. Since 1986, Elephas maximus has been listed as Endangered by IUCN as the population has declined by at least 50% over the last 60 to 75 years or three generations. Asian elephants are threatened by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation. In general, Asian elephants are smaller than African elephants and have the highest body point on the head. The tip of their trunk has one finger-like process. Their back is convex or level. Indian elephants reach a shoulder height of between 2 and 3.5 m (6.6 and 11.5 ft), weigh between 2,000 and 5,000 kg (4,400 and 11,000 lb), and have 19 pairs of ribs. Their skin color is lighter than of maximus with smaller patches of depigmentation, but darker than of sumatranus. Females are usually smaller than males, and have short or no tusks.\n\nThe largest Indian elephant was 3.43 metres (11.3 ft) high at the shoulder. In 1985, two large elephant bulls were spotted for the first time in Bardia National Park, and named Raja Gaj and Kanchha. They roamed the park area together and made occasional visits to the females. Raja Gaj stood 11.3 ft (3.4 m) tall at the shoulder and had a massive body weight. His appearance has been compared to that of a mammoth due to his high bi-domed shaped head. His forehead and domes were more prominent than in other Asian bull elephants.\n\nIndian elephants have smaller ears, but relatively broader skulls and larger trunks than African elephants. Toes are large and broad. Unlike their African cousins, their abdomen is proportionate with their body weight but the African elephant has a large abdomen as compared to the skulls.\n\nFlatulence is defined in the medical literature as \"flatus expelled through the anus\" or the \"quality or state of being flatulent\", which is defined in turn as \"marked by or affected with gases generated in the intestine or stomach; likely to cause digestive flatulence\". The root of these words is from the Latin flatus \u2013 \"a blowing, a breaking wind\". Flatus is also the medical word for gas generated in the stomach or bowels. These standard definitions do not reflect the fact that a proportion of intestinal gas may be composed of swallowed environmental air, and hence flatus is not totally generated in the stomach or bowels. The scientific study of this area of medicine is termed flatology.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

No cat wants something shoved down his throat, and he will fight you tooth and nail to prevent it. Although most cats are small in size, you'd be quite amazed with how much power they actually have.  There are ways that you can get your cat to take his pills, which we will cover below.\n\nThe easiest way to give a cat pill is to crush the power into a powdery form by putting it between two spoons.  Once the pill is powder, mix it in with some wet cat food.  Cats that are used to eating dry cat food will see the wet food and think of it as a treat.  They will normally eat it up, unaware that they just took their medicine.\n\nIf the medicine happens to be in capsule form, all you have to do is pry the capsule apart then sprinkle the medicine on some wet food and serve it to your pet.  If the food also contains the pill or if your pet is sick, chances are he won't eat it.  In this event, you should look into a pet piller.  You can get these handy devices from your veterinarian.  They are plastic rods that hold the pill until you press a plunger.  When you get one, you should always get a long one with a softer tip.\n\nWhen you get your gun, your vet should show you how to use it.  The most difficult aspect of using the gun is getting your cat to open his mouth.  The gun will more or less shoot the pill in the cat's mouth, and down his throat.  You'll need to hold him tight, to make sure that he doesn't wiggle his way loose.  Once you have his mouth open, you'll need to squeeze the trigger and pull the gun away quickly.  After the pill has been inserted, make sure you give your cat a treat.\n\nIf you aren't comfortable using the gun, you can always try giving your cat his pills by hand.  To do it this way, you'll need to hold your cat still, and open his mouth with your hand.  Once you have his mouth open, you should aim for the back of his throat and throw the pill in.  Once it is in his mouth, you should close his mouth with your hand and hold it shut for a few moments.

In the future, after a Third World War has decimated much of the Earth's population, a new nation known as Libria rises up under the unquestioned leadership of Dupont (Angus MacFadyen). Believing human emotions and their expression were to blame for the failings of past societies, The Father has decreed that all citizens must take a daily dose of Prozia II, a drug which levels out the emotional landscape, and that all forms of creative expression are against the law; violating either regulation can be punished by death. John Preston (Christian Bale) is a Grammaton, an elite law enforcement officer who tracks down and punishes \"sense offenders.\" One day, Preston accidentally fails to take his Prozia II, and for the first time begins experiencing emotions himself. Preston becomes aware of an underground of rebels who refuse to take their medication and have embraced art and literature, and he finds himself becoming infatuated with one of their number, Mary O'Brian (Emily Watson).

I remember when I first listened to this piece from an actual floppy disk that used to come with some Guitar Player magazine issues and it just blew me away never having heard of anything like that, my being rooted in the likes of old school greats such as Hendrix, Clapton etc.\n This was the introduction of a completely new era that was at the time just beginning and is long gone now, But the fire that these two great artists lit in me, still burns like it used to, and here it is thusly my tribute.", "title": "Go off!!

The Pantanal is the world's largest freshwater wetland and in recent years it has become increasingly threatened by large development programmes and changes in land management practices. Since 2005, the RZSS Pantanal Conservation and Research initiative has been conducting scientific research to create, implement and evaluate conservation actions and sustainable land management strategies. Results from the Pantanal are used to promote conservation throughout Brazil and internationally.\n\nIn partnership with IPE (Institute for Ecological Research) RZSS, as well as North American and European zoos, participates in the Pantanal Giant Armadillo Project which is a long term ecological study on the secretive giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus) about which virtually nothing is known.\n\nAfter almost two years of preparation the Pantanal Giant Armadillo project started in June 2011. This is currently the only project in the world to be focused on this species.  Although giant armadillos range over much of South America almost nothing is known about them and most information is anecdotal. Due to its cryptic behaviour and low population densities, this animal is very rarely seen. The giant armadillo is currently classified as Vulnerable (A2cd) by the IUCN/SSC Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nThe main goal of the project is to investigate the ecology and biology of the species and understand its function in the ecosystem using radio transmitters, camera traps, burrow surveys, resource monitoring, resource mapping and interviews.  In 2011 from June to December five giant armadillos were captured.  Because the species is so rare, it is very very difficult to find. \n\nThe project is integrating its findings into local and National initiatives. At the end of 2012 the first steps to evaluate and use data to assess the status of giant armadillos according to the IUCN/SCC red list criteria will be taken. Data will also be compiled for population viability analysis. \n\nRZSS work on many different fronts in Brazilian, the Pantanal Giant Armadillo Project being one of them.  To learn more about the RZSS Pantanal Conservation and Research Initiative and the other work it conducts visit the RZSS website.\n\nFor more information on the RZSS Pantanal Conservation and Research Initiative please visit: http://www.rzss.org.uk/", "title": "Armadillo Diaries - 1: The Search Begins", "publishedDate": "2012-09-20T08:06:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ibZ4E-KtAM", "description": "", "title": "Don't Forget Your Old Shipmate - Sea Chantey", "publishedDate": "2013-11-20T06:05:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ib_WI46wP4", "description": "", "title": "The bears paw-4", "publishedDate": "2014-10-08T20:15:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ibbMou_PJE", "description": "This project was made by students of Schillergymnasium in M\u00fcnster. \n\nVisit us on http://www.easy-languages.org", "title": "Easy Turkish - Basic Phrases: G\u00fcnayd\u0131n - Good morning", "publishedDate": "2013-07-09T18:54:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ibx0q9mTtc", "description": "Let me take a moment o show some kindness\nto the people who thought blindness\nwas a disease that affected the eyes alone\ni promise i wont judge you\ni barley know how to love you \nand like fools we preach rules but we don't even follow our own\n\nwho knew? \nin man's own ignorance we forgot that women once watched us grow\nand before that you ere just a tiny ball of flesh without any bones\nand before that you were just unknown \nand now look behold you can make it on your own\nbut who knew you would follow you ancestress back to zoo?\nEVEN THE DEVIL BELIEVES IN GOD SO WHAT DOES THAT MAKE YOU?\n\nMy heroes never wore tight or appeared on cartoon channels \nthey had long beards and kept clothes below the ankles \ni'm a big fan of Abraham \nnever break up from Jacob \nJoseph had the kind of beauty that you couldn't find in make up\nMoses was to Pharaoh what stones are to arrows \nand David to Goliath was truth is to silence \nFollowing Solomon i'd get down too \ndue to popular belief  Jesus is my homeboy too\nSo peace be upon the whole crew who came to teach what we never knew even though few got the groove they never turned blue never confused what was true even if it was a taboo never came for fame or praise but to praise who they prayed too \n\nWho knew?\nthat unknown man from the middle of the dessert\nwould change the whole world from darkness into heaven \nYOU MAY HAVE EVERY TITLE \nEVERY BIG SHOT DEGREE\nBUT YOU STILL CAN'T EXPLAIN ALEEF LAAAM MEEM \nwho knew?\nThere would be so many views and way to explain\nThat he's closer to you than your jugular vein\nSo if you complain that God must be cruel\nCan you give Allah, all that he gives to you?\nFrom the breath that you breath, to the trees that you feed\nFrom the eyes that you see, to the sea that you eat\n\nhelp me to practice your holy text i don't care about this life\ni'm worried about the next\nso don't let them get you down \nask Allah for some better days \nbecause when the whole world pushes you to your knees \nyou are in the perfect position to pray", "title": "All About Islam - Talent Show Performance", "publishedDate": "2012-08-31T11:58:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "8icTM5kZIyw", "description": "This video shows varus wedging to an OTC arch support to help open up the lateral knee compartment and increase medial knee compartment weight bearing.

That's exactly what happened to young Melody Bell and her two friends, Harmon E. Cord and Justin Tyme. These three youngsters share their common aspirations to one day become celebrated pop stars!\n\nTheir names reflect the three elements found in music: a melody, the harmony, and its rhythm. With that in mind, a magical red disc-shaped contraption, named Middle C, whisks them into space headed for the tiny undetected planet, Mutonia, the music planet. Middle C explains to the threesome because of their musical names, they are the only ones qualified for the important mission called Operation: Restore Music.\n\nOnce the youngsters arrive at the entrance of the unique planet, they encounter all kinds of situations, special settings and strange, yet engaging characters, where they become entangled into weird, scary, fearful, but often wondrous experiences.\n\nAfter much drama, the threesome finally unlock secrets as to why music has mysteriously vanished from their own planet: Earth!\n\nAbout the Author \nThe inspiration for this fantasy adventure takes the author back to her early age of two, when she began dance lessons at Mae Murry Dance Studio. She thrived in this environment, eventually winning a small dance competition on TV.\n\nAt age ten, her mother found an excellent art teacher who taught in the realistic classic style. Students would select prints of the master artists, learn to work in oils, producing the exact replica of the print. Art would continue to be one of her passions, as well as dance.\n\nThirdly, at age six, piano lessons were added to her daily schedule with strict rules. \"Once you start, you can never stop! You must practice one hour a day, seven days a week, including your birthday and all holidays. It should be a routine just like brushing your teeth!\" explained her mother, carefully. Somehow our author signed up for this commitment! She studied with various teachers throughout the years. Finally, as a young adult, under the guidance of Edith Knox, herself a graduate of the famed Juilliard School of Music in N.Y. At the prestigious music school, Miss Knox had the privilege to hone her technique along with learning advanced theory from a Russian professor who, himself, had his tutorship with the well-respected romantic composer, Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n\nEventually, after college, the author became a piano teacher. It wasn't until she married that she studied writing. Her father-in-law had been asked, in 1939, to head Universal Pictures in order to save the failing film studio from bankruptcy. His legacy took place while Ms. Kallison was growing up. Her father-in-law remained the president until 1960 when he become the Chairman of the Board and brought in Lew Wasserman to be president. Once married, Ms. Kallison found herself surrounded by writers leading her to understand the art of writing, and where the author's imagination came alive to weave this unique tale.\n\nBuy your own copy today at http://rosedogbooks-store.stores.yahoo.net/plmuandyopop.html\n\nVisit the author's website at http://www.planetmutonia.weebly.com", "title": "Planet Mutonia and the Young Pop Star Wannabes", "publishedDate": "2010-11-18T19:42:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "8iyAn-KEKek", "description": "je vous fais cette vid\u00e9o pour vous montrer comment avoir money illimiter sur subway surfer\nle site c'est appxg \nle lien pour android c'est: http://appxk.com/DownSoft/?softid=6070 \net pour iphone ipad ou ipod touch c'est: http://appxk.com/DownSoft/?softid=5493\net vous choisissez votre lien de t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement.", "title": "cheat ou hack subway surfer argent illimiter sur android et iphone .", "publishedDate": "2013-03-11T17:10:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "8iyqeyrN25g", "description": "In the review we are taking a look at Containment:The Zombie Puzzler by Bootsnake Games.", "title": "Video Game Review - Containment: The Zombie Puzzler", "publishedDate": "2012-04-11T08:01:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "8iysRazwh88", "description": "The Sims 3 World Adventures France guide - Video-36", "title": "The Sims 3 World Adventures France guide - Video-36", "publishedDate": "2012-10-22T04:17:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "8iyvTxQvcyQ", "description": "Chef Bruno: THE REAL DEAL Cooking show.

The ultraviolet light is absorbed by the molecule and excites electrons in it to higher energy levels. Normally the molecule bumps into other molecules and looses this energy, dropping the electrons back into their ground levels. In fluorescent materials though, the electrons release their energy first as fluorescent light before they loose their energy through collisions. In trispyridine copper iodide, the molecules vibrate and collide too much at room temperature and thus destroy any chance of fluorescence, so the substance looks non-fluorescent. But if cooled low enough, the molecules vibrate less and thus the electrons have more opportunity to emit light before a collision.\n\nNow moving on, if a few drops of the trispyrdine copper iodide solution is put on a sheet of filter paper and allowed to dry. it looses a pyridine molecule to become bispyridine copper iodide. This substance is more stable and will fluoresce at room temperature. But cooling will not improve the fluorescence noticeably since the substance is already stable enough to resist collisional deactivation.\n\nWarming the substance a bit liberates another pyridine molecule to yield pyridine copper iodide. This substance has a brilliant yellow fluorescence and amazingly exhibits a color change when cooled with liquid nitrogen. What's happening is that at room temperature it *partially* looses energy upon collision and emits yellow light. But when cooled, the reduction in collisions lets the electrons retain more energy  and thus when they emit its a bluer, higher energy light. this chance in color with temperature is thermochromism.\n\nNow extra heating drives off the last pyridine molecule and leaves behind copper iodide which has a dull red fluorescence when cooled and no fluorescence at room temperature.\n\nBut the most interesting fluorescence is with pyridine copper iodide.", "title": "AWESOME FLUORESCENCE THERMOCHROMISM", "publishedDate": "2011-09-17T21:00:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "8jDT60WcrLw", "description": "SADISM CLIPS DEATH METAL FROM CHILE", "title": "SADISM - CLIPS", "publishedDate": "2008-12-27T18:39:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "8jDi87Ruz74", "description": "Ensayo en la sala habitual ejecutando la re version de nuestro tema", "title": "Realidad - Alguien Sue\u00f1a", "publishedDate": "2011-02-12T10:37:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "8jDowezkSBc", "description": "From the Springer article: The distributional changes and role of microtubules in Nod factor-challenged Medicago sativa root hairs\n\nhttp://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?id=doi:10.1007%2fs00425-003-1097-1\n\nby: Weerasinghe, Ravisha R.; Collings, David A.; Johannes, Eva; Allen, Nina Str\u00f6mgren; \n\nvideo1.mov (2.0 MB)\n\nJournal: Planta Vol. 218 Issue 2\nDOI: 10.1007/s00425-003-1097-1\nPublished: 2003-12-01", "title": "The distributional changes and role of microtubules in Nod factor-challenged Medicago sativa root h", "publishedDate": "2010-12-03T01:42:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "8jDzj0TAe6g", "description": "Nokor Bachey temple is a cultural and historical site.

(I'm sure that if you're a salon owner you have racked your brains trying to find ways to make real money out of your business and ended up dispirited every time). \n\nIf this statistic is even half right, you're only ever going to earn 10% of the revenue your stylists generate.

It was granted by King Philip II to Garc\u00eda \n\n\u00c1lvarez de Toledo y Osorio, Viceroy of Sicily and Catalonia, and later Marquis of Villafranca del Bierzo in inheritance from his elder brother.\u00a0 It was \n\nconferred on him the 24 December 1559, along with the Princedom of Montalb\u00e1n.\n\u00a0\nThe title was usually held by the heirs apparent of the Marquises of Villafranca, and merged into the House of Medina Sidonia in 1779 when Jos\u00e9 \n\n\u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 11th Marquis of Villafranca and 8th Duke of Fernandina inherited the Dukedom of Medina Sidonia from a distant cousin. After the \n\ndeath 12th Duke, Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, none of his sons claimed the title, so the Dukedom of Fernandina became dormant. 80 years later, \n\nthe 21st Duchess of Medina Sidonia and her son the Count of Niebla ceded their rights to the title to their daughter and sister, Pilar Gonz\u00e1lez de \n\nGregorio, who asked for the resumption of the dormant dukedom. On 1 February 1993, the title was restored with Grandeeship of Spain by King Juan \n\nCarlos I to Pilar, who became the 13th Duchess of Fernandina and is the current holder of the title.\n\nYouTube:  www.YouTube.com/SEASitalia  \n\n(C) SEASitalia@att.net 2011.

Thus, he who avoids these doubtful matters certainly clears himself in regard to his religion and his honour. But he who falls into the doubtful matters falls into that which is unlawful like the shepherd who pastures around a sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Verily every king has a sanctuary and Allaah's sanctuary is His prohibitions. In the body there is a morsel of flesh which, if it be sound, all the body is sound and which, if it be diseased, all of the body is diseased. This part of the body is the heart. \n\n[Recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim]", "title": "#6 - 40 Hadith An Nawawi - The Halaal is Clear & the Haraam is Clear", "publishedDate": "2014-01-12T16:58:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "8jTcKu5yWQ4", "description": "For more  videos and details, go to http://drpaulose.com\nPatients with severe degree of snoring and sleep apnea are not getting enough oxygen while sleeping.They are hypoxic.They look dull and cynosed.The uvula and soft palate are typically bluish as seen in this patient.", "title": "Loud Snorer:Cynosed:Dr.K.O.Paulose FRCS", "publishedDate": "2012-09-12T13:28:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "8jTcu2gk6tE", "description": "Ven y conoce", "title": "Dulceria Sahuaro", "publishedDate": "2013-04-12T03:09:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8jTjx6n33YE", "description": "HTTP://SKINHEADS.NET.MY/\n\nA.C.A.B -Racial Hatred 2\n\nstill it happen in our world today\nracist bastard still having to say\nwhy can't we live in unity\none nation with pride and dignity\n\nare there to judge by the colour\nare there to win by hating each other\nthere's a cause,a couse to fight\nif it cause fight racism then we must unite\n\nthe wrath of oi unite us all\nnever fall, we will stand tall\nliving in this life we like\nfithing another, racist attack\n\nno matter if you black or white\nit's not your colour that makes it right\nno matter if you yellow or brown\nit's not your colour that should put you down\n\nunite is the thing's to be\nsee how strong that we can be\nstick together and see it trough\nthe strengh will build with me and you", "title": "A.C.A.B - Racial Hatred 2", "publishedDate": "2013-03-11T17:53:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "8jUMafPPXug", "description": "http://www.warsaho.hit.bg/\nhttp://www.biosistema.hit.bg/\nhttp://www.bgzmii.hit.bg/", "title": "Dragon Rising Fps", "publishedDate": "2009-09-04T07:36:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8jUcIcO4la8", "description": "56J Lincoln Street, Ponsonby\nCity Realty Limited Licensed (REAA 2008)\nIvan Koulin\nRay White Broadway\n\nFabulous opportunity to secure your very own pied-a-terre / city pad within walking distance to Ponsonby  Road  with all its bars, cafes and restaurants and Link bus for easy access into the city.

He lends us his expertise on a daily basis. Foreign Exchange (FX) Market analysis is a daily market overview and commentary.\n\nMarkets look to earnings for direction\n\nA US holiday yesterday kept a lid on market activity but there will be plenty of Q4 earnings reports over coming days to give further direction. In terms of policy decisions the Bank of Japan and Bank of Canada will likely keep policy unchanged following their policy decisions this week. The BoC is faced with inflation well below target while the BoJ continues to battle to push inflation towards its 2 per cent target. Both central banks will maintain easy policy.\n\nOn the data front there is very little of note in the US to focus on, with the main release being the December existing home sales report on Thursday where a rebound of 1 per cent is expected. European data releases may prove to be more interesting, with the release of flash purchasing managers indices on tap. Further gradual gains are likely to be registered in January although there will be attention on France which has lagged behind other countries.\n\nRatings decisions by Moody's and Fitch on Germany and France, respectively, will also garner some attention. Rumours of a German downgrade are likely to prove unfounded. In the UK the Bank of England MPC minutes will be likely to reveal an unchanged outcome of voting to keep policy unchanged although the BoE is likely to adjust its guidance soon reflecting the quicker than anticipated fall in the unemployment rate.\n\nThe USD looks well placed to extend last week's gains, especially against the EUR, with a drop below 1.3500 on the cards. Disinflation pressures and relatively soft growth highlight the potential for easier monetary policy. A variety of options for the ECB are on the cards but the EUR will struggle to make headway given expectations of more ECB action. Additionally the EUR appears to be benefiting less from reserves recycling flows, especially given that Asian central bank reserves accumulation has likely to have slowed. The deterioration in speculative positioning reflects the deterioration in sentiment for the currency.\n\nFor all the latest news on currency exchange be sure to check out our   Daily Podcasts  .", "title": "Markets look to earnings for direction- Tuesday 21st January", "publishedDate": "2014-01-22T11:01:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "8jYOZz1a6dU", "description": "Subscribe Now:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=Cookingguide\n\nWatch More:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/Cookingguide\n\nKudzu tea can be made right at home, so long as you have access to the right ingredients.

Unspecified donations will go directly to The Order of the Sacred and Immaculate Hearts of Jesus and Mary. \n\nThe Order of the Sacred and Immaculate Hearts of Jesus and Mary (a Private Association of the Faithful within the Diocese of Steubenville, Ohio) initiated the \"Just One Dollar for Africa\" Campaign which seeks to assist our African brothers and sisters in the midst of their present unprecedented crisis.\n\nFigures released by the United Nations World Food Program (Dec. 16, 2002) estimate that 38 million African people currently face starvation, and still more in the months ahead. The Just One Dollar for Africa Campaign seeks to gather funds for the acquisition and distribution of food and care to those African peoples in the gravest needs in regards to a) the starvation crisis and b) the orphan crisis. \n\nThis campaign guarantees that 100% of each dollar will go directly for the acquisition and distribution of food for the starving peoples of Africa and to the care of African orphans. To insure the absolute fulfillment of this promise that 100% of the donations reach our African brothers and sisters directly, members of the Order of the Sacred and Immaculate Hearts of Jesus and Mary have traveled to Africa to establish independent contacts with already existing organizations. These on-site organizations have the infrastructures in place that are working towards the goals of feeding those in gravest danger of starvation and the care of orphans in regions where these crises are most prominent, specifically in countries such as Zimbia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, South Africa, and Ethiopia. \n\nTo further guarantee that 100% of each dollar goes directly to the African peoples, this campaign has received individual commitments from each on-site African organization being funded that donations will be used exclusively for the acquisition and distribution of food and care for the starving and orphans. Moreover, this campaign has received benefaction to assist in the administration of this project so as to safeguard completely that no administrative costs will be deducted from donations. \n\nCould you please help the peoples of Africa in such historically unprecedented need?

A packed venue. A badass DJ cutting his way through the bands two decades full of hits. An incredible bass player alongside a divinely gifted blues man on the Fender and an all-powerful drummer boy getting more than 1.000 die hard fans all hyped up. The S1W's (Security of the First World) bringing those fight the power vibes and, yep, doing some mad push ups. And of course a Chuck D and Flavor Flav with still an unmatched stage presence proving for almost 150 minutes they truly deserve to be honored the Rolling Stones of Rap.\n\nBesides, Public Enemy raising the highest amount ever funded via SellaBand with an incredible 75.000$ - yeeahbwooy, this definitely deserved an award being handed over by SellaBand CEO Michael Bogatzki live on stage.

Paul, an octopus who was born in Dorset, has correctly predicted the result of all six matches involving Germany and now all eyes are on him as he prepares to pick the winner of Sunday's final. \n\nAnyone who backed each of his predictions with a \u00a310 flutter so far would be \u00a384 up, but if they had rolled the bets into an accumulator would have won \u00a31,426.\n\nGraham Sharpe, a spokesman for the bookmakers, said: \"Punters are superstitious creatures at the best of times - and many have favourite tipsters they like to follow, but they tend to be human, so this is the first time we've genuinely had punters coming into betting shops and asking staff about the predictions made by an octopus.\"\n\nOn Friday morning, aquarium handlers will ask Paul to decide on the winner of the third-place playoff between Germany and Uruguay by extending one of his eight suckered arms towards one of two boxes bearing their flags.\n\nHe will then be asked to decide which team will lift the trophy on Sunday. But having already eaten Paul may decline to make another prediction, plunging the worlds of sport and gambling into turmoil. \n\ntelegraph.co.uk\nFans are now placing money on the mystic mollusc himself, rather than the outcome of the big game, while senior politicians have expressed concern about threats to his safety made by supporters of losing teams.\n\nPaul has also become a sensation on the internet, becoming one of the most talked-about topics on Twitter and Facebook while doctored images have been created of him appearing to decide the victor of forthcoming elections around the world. \n\nBastian Schepers, operations manager at Sea Life Oberhausen, the aquarium in western Germany where Paul now lives, said: \"It's good for us that he's right, but we hoped he would choose Germany. We hope it's not only luck.\"\n\nMatthew Fuller, senior aquarist at the Sea Life centre in Weymouth where the soothsaying sea creature was born two and a half years ago, said: \"I'm quite amazed at what he's done. We're just sorry that he left us.\"\n\nThe common octopus was transferred to Germany when young, where his keepers devised a dinnertime game in which he was offered the choice of two glass boxes containing a mussel.\n\nDuring the Euro 2008 football championships, flags of the competing sides were placed on the containers and it was noted that on almost every occasion, the team that Paul's tentacle touched first went on to win their match. \n\nThe trick was repeated at the start of South Africa's World Cup for Germany's games, and as the tournament progressed his uncannily accurate predictions were followed ever more closely.\n\nPaul guessed the outcome of all Germany's group games, including their shock loss to lowly Serbia, as well as their defeat of England and Argentina in subsequent rounds.\n\nThere was national anguish after he picked the container bearing the Spanish flag ahead of Wednesday night's semi-final, with angry fans calling for him to be \"thrown into the shark tank\".\n\nWhen Spain duly beat Germany, preserving his 100 per cent record, \"anti-octopus\" songs were aired in Berlin while Spanish fans chanted his name at the stadium in Durban.\n\nIt prompted Spain's Prime Minister, Jose Luiz Rodriguez Zapatero, to joke on a radio show: \"I am concerned for the octopus ... I am thinking of sending him a protective team.\"\n\nAlthough Paul had a 50 per cent chance of getting the correct result in each game, the chances of him getting all six right in a row were 1 in 64.\n\nWilliam Hill has now taken so many bets that Paul will correctly tip the winner of the final between Spain and the Netherlands that they have cut the odds from evens to 10-11.", "title": "2010 World Cup Paul the Octopus scores again *SPOILER ALERT*", "publishedDate": "2010-07-09T05:29:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "8kXhh5dC7Js", "description": "JustinBieberDay: Selena Gomez - The Heart Wants What It Wants\n\nAfter years of tabloid speculation and Internet gossip, Selena Gomez has decided to reveal the truth about her relationship with Justin Bieber and it\u2019s not pretty.\nHer new single, \u201cThe Heart Wants What It Wants,\u201d is an ode to toxic relationships and the lyrics offer fans a glimpse into the dysfunctional Jelena romance.\nThe video takes the heartbreak even further and begins with an audio clip of a teary Selena talking herself through the ups and downs of her relationship.

Dozens more red and white signs line Alabama Avenue, encouraging residents to \"Speak Out\" against the zoning changes.\n\n\"I think one of the primary things about this town is that it's very beautiful and it's really sweet and precious to the people who know it and love it. Development shouldn't mean that we have to sacrifice that,\" says Barbara Schauer, another homeowner.\n\nBoaz says, if the rezoning changes continue, a new developer would need more than one lot to build office space. He says the current lots don't meet size requirements for office buildings. In that case, Boaz says multiple homeowners would have to sell at once for a developer to build in the area.\n\nStill, neighbors say they'd like more of a say in the future layout of their town.\n\n\"The people that are most affected by it, the citizens occupying Weaverville, know nothing about it,\" says Jay Schauer, a homeowner. \"They have no opportunity to discuss the matter, all they get is three minutes to say I got a problem.\"\n\nThose three minutes will be allotted to each person willing to share their opinion at a public hearing which will be during Monday's council meeting.\n\nBoaz says the Planning Commission will be making a recommendation to the City Council to revert zoning for Alabama Avenue back to residential and allow time for broader discussion before settling on plans.", "title": "Weaverville Neighborhood Fights Zoning Changes", "publishedDate": "2014-11-05T12:39:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "8kdHnQQz084", "description": "With bits of evidence, researchers are convinced ivory-billed woodpeckers are not extinct and will soon be found in the swamps of northern Florida.", "title": "Ivory Billed Woodpecker", "publishedDate": "2012-10-25T14:20:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "8kdZsk2Ktks", "description": "Highlights of Miss Sri Lanka Australia 2014 pageant - Evening Wear", "title": "Miss Sri Lanka Australia pageant - Evening Wear", "publishedDate": "2014-08-06T00:16:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "8kdf_gCg_VM", "description": "This was the theme song opener for the 5th season of \"The Rifleman\" starring Chuck Connors which apparently seems to be currently lost.

They first formed in 1990, releasing the More Than Ever demo tape in 1991. This was quickly followed in 1992 by a split EP with Crisis of Faith and the Life Goes On EP that same year. The band was soon renowned as one of the heaviest in hardcore, drawing ire from some purists for incorporating metal riffage into their sound. Their rise in popularity paralleled that of other vegan straight edge bands such as Earth Crisis and hardline bands like Vegan Reich and Raid. While bands that adhered to Hardline were totally opposed to abortion, Chokehold was vehemently pro-choice. While Chokehold were atheists and radicals with a strongly anarchist streak to their politics, many of the hardline bands were by contrast conservative (expressing belief in a higher power, homophobia, support for the death penalty and prisons and other conservative views).\nIn 1993 Chokehold released the Prison of Hope LP through American label Conquer the World Records (CTW). They released their next record, 1994s Instilled EP, on Philadelphia, PAs Bloodlink Records. This EP featured some of their most powerful and political material to date, notably the anti-religious song Anchor, the anti-homophobia song Mindset, and Burning Bridges, with its hard-hitting lyrics: The corporations are aware where the average person is not, violence against one meat eater is not going to liberate a million animals. You must take action against those who run the industry, not the ones lied to. And to take them down we must use as much fucking violence as they do. Animal liberation, Earth liberation, Human liberation, will only come through education.\nThey followed this in the next year with their second LP, Content With Dying. This album contained by far their most controversial song yet: Not a Solution was possibly the most militantly pro-choice hardcore song since Born Againsts Mary and Child. The liner notes to the song state, to all the militant pro-lifers who couldnt spell life let alone understand it, we salute you with a middle finger. The song is directed at those who identify as pro-lifers, including many vegan straight edge bands at the time, most notably Abnegation. This song in particularly created a huge rift in the vegan straight edge scene. When Chokehold played a show with Abnegation that year, the two bands spent their sets screaming at each other, and they and their fans nearly came to blows. This refusal to back down in the face of significant opposition even within their own subculture typifies Chokeholds uncompromising stance in general.\nThey signed in 1996 to Germanys Mad Mob Records, who unbeknownst to them already had a bad reputation in the European hardcore scene. They recorded four new songs to be released as a split CD with Feeding the Fire, but after a European tour in 1996 the band decided to break up. They played their last show in March at the New Bedford Fest in Massachusetts. These four songs were released as a self-titled EP on Jawk Records the following year. Members went on to play in such bands as The Swarm, Brutal Knights, Left For Dead, Haymaker, Our War and Seventy-Eight Days.\n\n\nAlbum : Content with dying\n\nLyrics : Why does the law view women as little less than human? Why are their lives worthless than the property of the state? You know your country is sick when you get more for robbery than you do for rape. Yet it happened before our very eyes we allow these laws to exist. There is a greater value put on money than on human life. And still we sit passively? We let these laws classify us into men, women, and black and white. They discriminate by dropping the label of human, and stripping away our rights. Until we realize everyone is equal, nothing is going to change. How much longer can we afford these laws to stay the same? Not a minute longer because our lives are at risk. They dont give a fuck about you! The system is full of shit how can stealing money even compare to the crime or rape? These laws are not for people, they only benefit the state.", "title": "Chokehold - Regression", "publishedDate": "2010-03-06T01:19:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "8kl78AVS8L4", "description": "Robert Downey Jr. demanded all of these options.

His actual name was Juan de Fermoselle[2], and was one of at least 7 known children[3]. Fermoselle was a composer, poet and playwright,[4] often called the founder of Spanish drama.[5]\nHe was born in 1468 near Salamanca,[6] probably at Encina de San Silvestre. He was of Jewish converso descent.[7][8] After leaving Salamanca University[9] sometime in 1492[10] he became a member of the household of Don Fadrique de Toledo, the second Duke of Alba, although some sources believe that he did not work for the Duke of Alba until 1495[11]. A plausible argument is that his first post was as a Corregidor in northern Spain[12].\n\nFermoselle was a Chaplain at the Salamanca Cathedral in the early 1490s[13]. It was here that he adopted the name Enzina, or Encina during his stay as Chaplain[14]. He was later forced to resign as Chaplain because he was not ordained[15].\nn 1492 the poet entertained his patron with a dramatic piece, the Triunfo de la fama, written to commemorate the fall of Granada.[16] In 1496 he published his Cancionero,[17] a collection of dramatic and lyrical poems. He then applied for the canto post at Salamanca Cathedral, but the part was divided among three singers, including his rival Lucas Fernandez[18].\n\nWhile working for the Duke of Alba, Encina was the program director, of which Lucas Fernandez was a part of[19]. Here Encina wrote pastoral eclogues, the foundation of Spanish secular drama[20]. Encina's plays are predominantly based on shepherds and unrequited love[21].\n\nEncina was ambitious, looking to be promoted based on preferment,[22] so around 1500 he relocated to Rome, where he apparently served in the musical establishments of several cardinals or noblemen.[23] Encina was appointed Archdiaconate of Malaga Cathedral by Julius II in 1508[24].\n\nIn 1518 he resigned from position at Malaga for a simple benefice at Moron, and the following year he went to Jerusalem,[25] where he sung his first mass.[26] He also wrote about the events during his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in Tribagia o Via Sacra de Hierusalem[27]. In 1509 he had held a lay canonry at M\u00e1laga;[28] in 1519 he was appointed by Leon for the priorship of Leon Cathedral.[29] His last job was recorded as being in Leon, where he is thought to have died towards the end of 1529.[30]\n\nHis Cancionero is preceded by a prose treatise (Arte de trobar) on the condition of the poetic art in Spain. His fourteen dramatic pieces mark the transition from the purely ecclesiastical to the secular stage.[31] The Aucto del Repel\u00f3n and the \u00c9gloga de Fileno dramatize the adventures of shepherds;[32] the latter, like Pl\u00e1dcida y Vitoriano, is strongly influenced by the Celestina. The intrinsic interest of Encina's plays is slight, but they are important from the historical point of view, for the lay pieces form a new departure, and the devout eclogues prepare the way for the autos of the 17th century. Moreover, Encina's lyrical poems are remarkable for their intense sincerity and devout grace.\n\nEven though his works were dedicated to royal families, he never served as a member of a royal chapel[33]. And even though Encina worked in many Cathedrals and was ordained as a priest, no religious musical works are known to still exist[34]. Most of his works were done by his mid-30's[35], some 60 or more songs attributed to Encina, and another 9 settings of texts on top of that, to which the music could also be added, but not for certain[36]. Many of the surviving pieces are villancicos, which he was a leading composer in[37]. The Spanish villancico is the equivalent of the Italian Frottola[38]. There are three and four voice settings that offer a variety of styles depending on the kind of text, with very limited movements in the voices in preparation for the cadence points[39].To make the text heard clearly, Encina used varied and flexible rhythms that are patterned on the accents of the verse, and used simple yet strong harmonic progressions[40].\nEncina held the priorship of Leon Cathedral from November 1523 until his final illness in December 1529[41]. Juan del Encina's will was presented on January 14, 1530, so the exact date of his death is not known, but it is thought to be in late 1529 or early 1530[42]. In his will he noted that he wanted to be buried beneath the choir of Salamanca Cathedral[43], and in 1534 his remains were taken to the Cathedral[44].\nJuan del Enzina wrote in Castillian with Leonese language influences or in Leonese[45]for his language for his pastoral clogues. He was from Salamanca, a Leonese speaking region and eventually arrived at the capital of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, where he would eventually die.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_del_Encina", "title": "J.

OLIVER ST. LINGAM releases the tapes \"Pigfuck\" and \"Per Crucem Ad Lucem\" on the \"Unclean\"-label under the guise of PHALLUS DEI, named after an album by Krautrock legends AMON D\u00dc\u00dcL. Shortly after, PHALLUS DEI signed with the label Dark Vinyl, who released the first CD \"Pontifex Maximus\". It is amongst the most successful debuts of an Industrial band in 1991. After a successful tour with Italian Industrial legends SIGILLUM S, the personnel changed. MK. E. ,who was with them on tour, joined the band. Also, Dutch drummer / multi-instrumentalist RICHARD VAN KRUYSDIJK (who now also works with Niels van Hoorn (the Legendary Pink Dots) as STRANGE ATTRACTOR, and with Marie-Claudine Vanvlemen as SONAR LODGE) joined the band. The trio recorded several songs, later to be released on the album \"Cyberflesh\". JORIS HUIJBREGTS, who also features on this CD, played previously with Richard in the band Lament, and joined PHALLUS DEI a year later. Together they recorded the critically acclaimed albums \"Pornocrates\", \"Luxuria\" (feat. Gitane Demone), \"Orpheus & Eurydice\", as well as \"Universum\"; a CD by their ambient side-project PHD2. After Joris left in 1995, they continued as a trio, shifting their sound more and more towards electronica and experimental, cinematic music. A \"best of\"-CD (\"Adorations\") was released by Triple X in the USA, and after a period when the band members concentrated on different projects, they came back strong in 2001 with a new album: \"Nature Mortes\". As PHD2 they released their second album, entitled \"Resource\".\nDear people, if you got problem with receiving PHALLUS DEI Dogmatik http://youtu.be/ogpbysWzrqY, try copy/paste that link on http://www.hidemyass.com/.

We want to remember that when we deal with that material in the art, we apply manipulation to the wrist for two purposes. \n\nOne is a defensive purpose. We have to keep in mind that the art, to some degree, was designed for the law enforcement community, as well. Therefore, you can't just hit everybody and sometimes it's easier to solve problem with wrist manipulations. \n\nOf course, we use it for offensive purposes when we deal with taking down hostile individuals and moving them from point A to point B, when you want them to comply. \n\nLet's first talk about the more common wrist manipulations that you see. I'm sorry, but you're going to have to donate your hands for that purpose. Okay, so the most common one that you would see is that famous \"S\" shape or goose neck situation.\n\nWhat you want to remember about this wrist manipulation, is that it's important that all the joints are going to be bent. Therefore, wrist is bent. Elbow is bent, sorry, not straight. Wrist is bent and not straight. \n\nOnce you're here, it's important that the form will stay parallel to the ground. There will be a squeeze between the two hands. Once the squeeze were applied, they'll be rotation from my hands so the direction will come to here. \n\nA wrist manipulation like this could be applied in many, many ways. For example, if Ravi grabbed my arm and I do not want to punch him, for various reasons. All I can do is apply a manipulation to his wrist and come out of it in that direction. \n\nI can also apply this manipulation when he grabbed my shirt. Obviously, I'm afraid of a head butt so I'm right away going to protect myself but from here, I can apply exactly the same wrist manipulation.

There are millions of waste pickers worldwide, predominantly in developing countries, but increasingly in post-industrial countries as well.\n\nForms of waste picking have been practiced since antiquity, but modern traditions of waste picking took root during industrialization in the nineteenth century. Over the past half-century, waste picking has expanded vastly in the developing world due to urbanization.\n\nIn many cities, they provide the only solid waste collection service. A methodological tool is available, offering a systematic approach to include / integrate initiatives (Integration Radar or InteRa).\n\nMany terms are used to refer to people who salvage recyclables from the waste stream for sale or personal consumption. In English, these terms include rag picker, reclaimer, informal resource recoverer, binner, recycler, poacher, salvager, scavenger, and waste picker; in Spanish cartonero, chatarrero, pepenador, clasificador, minador and reciclador; and in Portuguese catador de materiais recicl\u00e1veis. A more contemporary term, focusing on the outcome of the professional activity, is \"informal sector recycling\". However, the word 'informal' can be partly misleading, because in practice a continuum between total informality and proper organization in taxed registered formal activities may be encountered.\n\nIn 2008, participants of the The First World Conference of Waste Pickers chose to use the term \"waste picker\" for English usage to facilitate global communication. The term \"scavenger\" is also commonly used, but many waste pickers find it demeaning due to the implied comparison with animals.\n\nA waste picker is different from a waste collector because the waste collected by the latter may be destined for a landfill or incinerator, not necessarily for a recycling facility.\n\n\"Dumpster diving\" generally refers to the practice of anti-consumer and freegan activists who reclaim items such as food and clothes from the waste stream as a form of protest against consumer culture. \"Waste picking\" generally refers to activity motivated purely by economic need.\n\nSource:Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Cancer kills more people than AIDS and tuberculosis combined.\n\n\"There are at least 5 million people who die of cancer each year with untreated pain,\" states Dr Kathleen Foley (USA).  \"We think this is an underestimate of pain in the world because there are 12 million survivors of cancer, people living with cancer, and we know about a third of them experience pain.\"\n\nDr Eva Rossina Duarte Juarez (Guatemala) agrees that cancer is indeed painful.  \"In the situation of advanced illnesses, people need to be able to die in peace.\"\n\nBreast cancer patient Carmen (Australia) reflects that she doesn't fear death however she did fear the essential medications designed to treat her cancer pain.  \"I had a lot of pain on every level, whether it was physical or emotional.\"\n\nDr Mark Boughey (Australia) of Caritas Christi Hospice in Melbourne explains, \"When Carmen got here pain was the big issue... She had that really problematic neuropathic pain so you couldn't even touch her skin without her screaming and being distressed.\"\n\n\"This problem is very much with us, it's a global problem, but also there are things we can do to bring the escalating problem of cancer under control,\" Professor David Hill.\n\nCarmen reflects that professional treatment of her pain brought back her sanity and quality of life.  \"I'm very blessed to have had this opportunity ... I've had really good care.\"\n\nFeaturing Professor David Hill (Australia), Dr Kathleen Foley (USA), Dr Eva Rossina Duarte Juarez (Guatemala), Dr Mark Boughey (Australia), Carmen (Australia).\n\nLIFE Before Death will include 50 short films themed around pain control and end of life issues, releasing one a week for a year from May 2011. \n\nA feature film was released in early 2012 and is available at http://www.lifebeforedeath.com\n\nThe project is presented by the Lien Foundation and produced by Moonshine Movies.\n\nIt is also supported by the International Association for the Study of Pain, The Mayday Fund, the Union for International Cancer Control and The Institute for Palliative Medicine at San Diego Hospice International Programs.\n\nTo Share Your Story visit http://www.TreatThePain.com", "title": "LIFE Before Death Cancer Pain", "publishedDate": "2011-07-14T23:15:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "8lPg_FmK1Kc", "description": "Between Glenfield and Holsworthy Railway Station, the seat has been sighted for the entire week until the date which this video was uploaded.\n\nHope they do something productive to retrieve the seat this weekend when the line closes for trackwork.", "title": "Seat thrown out from a CityRail Suburban Silver train", "publishedDate": "2012-08-16T07:50:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "8lQLjcAqde8", "description": "Here is the latest information on my off the grid (land) property search.", "title": "Purchasing Property Update", "publishedDate": "2014-06-16T17:31:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8lQbamwIYhs", "description": "Bushido - Mitten in der Nacht Instrumental / Karaoke !!!!\nBitte vergisst nicht meinen Channel zu abonnieren f\u00fcr mehr Lyrics/karaoke/instrumental", "title": "Bushido - Mitten in der Nacht Instrumental / Karaoke", "publishedDate": "2013-12-26T16:20:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8lQkZVXck24", "description": "Nikolai Bukharin and Joseph Stalin", "title": "Nikolai Bukharin and Joseph Stalin", "publishedDate": "2012-12-29T16:26:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "8lQmKbT_QnY", "description": "Bucking and tune", "title": "Homelite Super 1050 Automatic Bucking Huge Tree", "publishedDate": "2010-03-21T19:23:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "8lQnAk1WLow", "description": "See a compilation of animals that use prosthetic limbs.\n \nMany animals have successfully been able to use prosthetics to move around after an accident or medical problem. Here are 5 of them:\n\nNumber 5 - Motala, the elephant. Back in 1999, while Motala was working to move trees in the jungles of Thailand, she stumbled upon a land mine. Unfortunately, the land mine blew off one of her front legs which had to be amputated below her knee. However, thanks to the group, Friends of the Asian Elephant, a temporary prosthetic leg was devised in 2006.\n\nNumber 4 - Gamera, the African tortoise. After Gamera's leg was amputated due to an injury, doctor's at Washington State University replaced the tortoise's missing limb with a moving wheel.\n\nNumber 3 - Lemon Pie, the dog.  He was discovered in a trash bin, very close to death in Mexico. Lemon Pie's two front paws had been horrifically cut off by gang members. The animal was brought to an animal shelter, Canine Miracles, where he was fitted for prosthetic legs.\n\nNumber 2 - Fuji, the female dolphin. Residing in an aquarium in Japan, she lost 75% of her tail due to a mysterious illness in 2002. However, researchers at the Okinawa Aquarium in Japan installed an artificial rubber tail using metal and plastic screws giving her another chance to swim as naturally as possible.\n\nNumber 1 - A Hungarian stork with a broken beak was given a chance at survival with new prosthetic upper beak.  According to a BBC report, the hour-long operation was performed at the Hortobagy Birds' Hospital near Budapest. Dental prostheses specialist Tamas Kothay built a new beak made out of 'synthetic resin' for the stork.", "title": "5 Animals That Use Prosthetic Limbs", "publishedDate": "2012-11-08T12:19:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "8lQpB2pLtqE", "description": "Die Euphorbia fulgens ist ein echtes Saisonprodukt.

Using these logic gates you can assemble a digital chip of any type. However, in practice, logic gates combining functions of the above logic gates are in greater demand. These are: NAND, NOR logic gates and some other. Let me describe how the NAND and NOR logic gates work. If you install an inverter at AND output you will obtain the NAND logic gate. The truth table of this logic gate shows that a LOW output results only if both the inputs to the gate are HIGH. If one or both inputs are LOW, a HIGH output results. This electric circuit shows how the NAND logic gate works. Both the button and the switch are open, and the LED is on. This stands for LOW inputs resulting in HIGH output. Now let's apply one HIGH input. For this purpose, close the switch but the LED is still on resulting in HIGH output. Now let's close both the switch and the button. The LED is off resulting in LOW output. This is fully in line with the truth table. The NOR logic gate includes series-connected OR and NOT logic gates. A HIGH output (1) results if both the inputs to the gate are LOW (0). If one input is or both inputs are HIGH (1), a LOW output (0) results. Let me show you how the NOR logic gate functions in a primitive circuit: the switch and the button are open, and the LED is on. This means that LOW inputs result in HIGH output. Now let's apply one HIGH input. For this purpose, let's close either the switch  or button, the LED is off resulting in LOW output. This is in line with the truth table.For the purpose of simplicity and clarity these circuits include only two inputs. This does not mean that all circuits have two inputs. In practice, the number of inputs may reach 8 or even 10. If you understand how logic gates function, you will easily seize the point how digital devices work.", "title": "Logic Gates: NAND, NOR", "publishedDate": "2010-11-29T21:52:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "8la8mjuxXMg", "description": "cop it here: http://contactplay.bandcamp.com/album/cp-unreleased-vol-1", "title": "Contact Play Unreleased Vol. 1 Fenland Badmans", "publishedDate": "2012-03-05T05:05:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "8laIw7UsQ7I", "description": "A man in India has been growing his fingernails for nearly 50 years and has to protect them with a cover when he moves around.\n\nwww.itnsource.com\nReuters 15233/00", "title": "Longest Fingernails", "publishedDate": "2007-07-16T15:26:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "8laYIBARLBw", "description": "Home Bedsheet with bedspread by Shayan, This exclusive bed sheet set consists of 5 double bed sheet and 10 pillow covers.

In seiner reinen Form ist Harnstoff ein wei\u00dfer, kristalliner Feststoff. Er wird von den meisten Lebewesen als Endprodukt von Stoffwechselvorg\u00e4ngen mit dem Urin ausgeschieden. Lange Zeit dachten die Wissenschaftler, dass organische Substanzen etwas komplett anderes seien als anorganische Substanzen. Die Bildung organischer Substanzen f\u00fchrten sie auf eine spezielle \u201eLebenskraft\" zur\u00fcck, die es nur in Organismen gab. Daher schien eine Herstellung organischer Verbindungen im Labor unm\u00f6glich. Dies \u00e4nderte sich 1828 als der Chemiker Friedrich W\u00f6hler Kaliumcyanat und Ammoniumsulfat mischte. Aus der Verbindung dieser beiden anorganischen Substanzen entstanden kleine wei\u00dfe Kristalle, die ihm bekannt vorkamen und er analysierte sie gr\u00fcndlich. Das Ergebnis war verbl\u00fcffend, denn es handelte sich bei diesen Kristallen um die gleiche Substanz, die er aus dem Urin isoliert hatte: Harnstoff. Es war also doch m\u00f6glich organische Substanzen aus anorganischen Ausgangsstoffen herzustellen.\n\nMit dieser k\u00fcnstlichen Synthese von Harnstoff wurde auch die lange vorherrschende Trennung zwischen organischen und anorganischen Substanzen aufgehoben und der Einstieg in die organische Chemie gelegt.", "title": "Harnstoffsynthese - Trailer Schulfilm Chemie", "publishedDate": "2013-07-24T12:53:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "8lbgHQN_YAE", "description": "Drift show & G.P. korinthos 2013", "title": "Drift show & G.P. korinthos 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-07-14T10:09:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "8lbrMsiS4Rc", "description": "\u30af\u30ed\u30a2\u30b7\u30cd\u30b3(Black-footed Cat) - \u5357\u30a2\u30d5\u30ea\u30ab\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u3001\u30ca\u30df\u30d3\u30a2\u3001\u30dc\u30c4\u30ef\u30ca\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066\u308f\u305a\u304b\u306b\u30b8\u30f3\u30d0\u30d6\u30a8\u306b\u3082\u5206\u5e03\u3059\u308b\u3001\u5c0f\u578b\u306e\u91ce\u751f\u306e\u732b\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30ab\u30e9\u30cf\u30ea\u7802\u6f20\u306e\u534a\u7802\u6f20\u5730\u5e2f\u3084\u30b5\u30d0\u30f3\u30ca\u5730\u5e2f\u306b\u70b9\u5728\u3059\u308b\u3002\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u306a\u4f53\u91cd\u306f1.6kg\u3067\u3001\u73fe\u5b58\u3059\u308b\u732b\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u6700\u3082\u5c0f\u3055\u3044\u3082\u306e\u306e\u4e00\u3064\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\n\nThe black-footed cat (Felis nigripes) is the smallest African cat, and is endemic in the south west arid zone of the southern African subregion.

The robot accomplishes coverage of an unknown surface by visiting all reachable surfaces in the environment. The efficiency and completeness of coverage is improved by the construction of a topological map while the robot covers the surface. The topological map is a spatial representation of the environment constructed with information gathered by the robots sensors. Robot uses the constructed topological map to plan complete coverage paths. Existing methods generally use grid maps, which are susceptible to odometry error, inaccuracies in sensors and may require considerable memory and computation. Topological map is based on topological relationships between landmarks. Landmarks are represented by corners because they are naturally ocurring features of the environment. It is rather difficult to store information about what area the robot has covered. This difficulty in storing coverage information is overcome by embedding a cell decomposition within the map. Decomposition method uses the landmarks in the topological map as its cell boundaries. The cells are ideally suited to coverage by a simple zigzag path. Covering the envrionment robot detects new uncovered cells and updates the topological map. Robot moves from one cell to another until all surfaces are covered.\n\n--\nLuka Gabric\ne-mail: luka.gabric@gmail.com\nhomepage: http://www.lukagabric.com", "title": "Topological Coverage of Unknown Environment by a Mobile Robot", "publishedDate": "2009-10-09T08:14:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8lmBI_WCbvs", "description": "La GANADORA DEL 1er LUGAR EN LA TERCERA CATEGORIA  Y GANADORA DEL 3er LUGAR DE TODAAAAS  LAS SOLISTAS POR SU FORMA DE BAILAR Y DE EXPRESION", "title": "Here Tahiti solista- Rocio Abila", "publishedDate": "2009-12-16T00:36:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "8lmEzAd1nvo", "description": "Two long-winged adult males of Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica, family Blattidae) fighting and kicking each other over a mate (short-winged female) during the courtship ritual in captivity.
