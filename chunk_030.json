This is a re-release of OH JULIE  but b/w GAWK N' STROLL  (instead of MY LITTLE GIRL)  on the AVI \"Antiques\" records label ~circa 1980.  GAWK N' STROLL was composed by Noel Ball & Kenneth Moffett, who also composed the popular OH JULIE.  Because The Diamonds had a hit in 1957 with THE STROLL and since The Stroll was a hugely popular dance in 1957 & 1958, my guess is,  that GAWK N' STROLL was recorded in the same time period. I can find no mention of the recording anywhere.\n\n(Here's the link to The Crescendos -- SCHOOL GIRL)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHf54cUdqYo\n(Here's the link to The Diamonds -- THE STROLL)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Gwb70fJac", "title": "GAWK N' STROLL ~ The Crescendos", "publishedDate": "2010-06-24T04:25:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "0pQWhCb7SKo", "description": "The last production day second shift March 31, 2010. 1st. shift closed the plant the following day in the morning of April 1 around 9:40 a.m. The last auto plant in the west coast is dead.", "title": "NUMMI The Last Day 2nd shift", "publishedDate": "2010-04-01T06:52:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "0pQmbbFnXNw", "description": "lac de Maine, Angers, Maine-et-Loire", "title": "9.11.07 Macreuse noire (Melanitta nigra, Black Scoter)", "publishedDate": "2010-04-22T11:02:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "0pR248zb1QQ", "description": "Free Man Cafe.

Soft touch on back of ball moving it across your body \n2.) Sell the move\n3.) Change pace\n\nExercise you can do: \nSet up four cones.  Two to act as a defender and then one to side of each defender about 7 yards away to give you an idea of changing pace.  All cones in a straight line.  Do the move, accelerate to the end cone, jog back.  Repeat 5 times.  Then relax and repeat the set as many times as you would like.\n\nWhat you could do wrong:  \nIf you find you can't scissor the ball fast enough, you may be taking to big of a touch.  Remember that 1st touch across your body is a little one, not a big one.  \n\nIf it is feeling awkward for you and you aren't really getting your shoulders into it, it's probably because your plant foot, non scissoring foot isn't moving out wide when it should be when you take your touch inside.  When you touch inside make sure your plant foot steps out wide like you are going to run, this helps sell the fake and frees up room for you to scissor. \n\nFriend / Follow Online Soccer Academy \n\nhttp://www.Facebook.com/OnlineSoccerAcademy\nhttp://www.Twitter.com/JaredMontz\nhttp://www.Instagram.com/JaredMontz\nhttp://www.YouTube.com/OnlineSoccerAcademy\n\nRemember if you Believe in it\u00ae and back that up with hard work anything in life is possible!\n\nFree Royalty Free Music from http://www.DanoSongs.com", "title": "How to do the Advanced Scissors - Soccer Training - Online Soccer Academy", "publishedDate": "2011-04-25T02:19:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "0p_IvQe11VI", "description": "Autism Symptoms & Early Signs\n\nWhat to Look for in Babies, Toddlers, and Children\n\nAs a parent, you never want to believe that your precious bundle has a problem.

The minecraft raytracer treats the entire world as a large uniform grid with a jumpmap. \n\nI made a non-Euclidean world.   It uses all the same technology, only, in addition, it can manipulate and bend the rays around the scene while it's rendering.  This means single primitives can be warped visually. \n\nAnother neat thing was I made the walking use the exact same system the visual rays use.  This allows you to walk through the world as you see it.\n\nCurrently this whole system only works on Linux, but could theoretically work elsewhere.\n\nSorry about the poor framerate, I'm on a laptop with Optimus so its drivers are super pokey.  Also, video cap sucks down whatever performance is left.\n\nHope to spur some interest and I'd love to work with others on this.

Unlike fission weapons, there are no inherent limits on the energy released by thermonuclear weapons. \n\nThe United States, Russia, United Kingdom, People's Republic of China, France and India\u2014have conducted thermonuclear weapon tests. \n\n\nThe basics of the Teller--Ulam design for a hydrogen bomb: \na fission bomb uses radiation to compress and heat a separate section of fusion fuel.\nThermonuclear bombs use energy of a fission bomb to compress and heat fusion fuel. In the Teller-Ulam design, which accounts for all multi-megaton yield hydrogen bombs, this is accomplished by placing a fission bomb and fusion fuel (tritium, deuterium, or lithium deuteride) in proximity within a special, radiation-reflecting container. When the fission bomb is detonated, gamma and X-rays emitted first compress the fusion fuel, then heat it to thermonuclear temperatures. The ensuing fusion reaction creates enormous numbers of high-speed neutrons, which can then induce fission in materials not normally prone to it, such as depleted uranium. Each of these components is known as a \"stage\", with the fission bomb as the \"primary\" and the fusion capsule as the \"secondary\". In large hydrogen bombs, about half of the yield, and much of the resulting nuclear fallout, comes from the final fissioning of depleted uranium.", "title": "Thermonuclear hydrogen bomb test.", "publishedDate": "2010-10-23T19:20:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "0po3lIofTrg", "description": "playin gladiators at work, listen to here my cheek break.", "title": "cheeky bastard - broken cheek bone", "publishedDate": "2007-04-20T14:40:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "0posJS61syw", "description": "When he wasn't saving lives yesterday, surf god Laird Hamilton pulled an INSANE move off the beaches of Malibu -- SHOOTING THE PIER -- and TMZ Sports has the footage.", "title": "Laird Hamilton -- SHOOTS THE PIER ...

A 2010 report from Northern Iowa showed that 176 monarchs inhabited a 100 acre area.

You recognise his deep, soulful sounds in the track Wind.\n\nLelethu hails from South Africa and extends her xhosa roots lyrically in the music she writes and sings. Her sultry voice can be explored on her last release on Offering Recordings as well, Ndinomsindo (translated \"I'm Angry\") and now Olothando (translated \"That Love\").\n\nThis Song, Olothando, is about a Love that grows as two people grow. They find strength in each other and also reliving the childhood memories of how their love started, from the flirting to maturity and memories of happiness. Only they mattered to each other and nothing else. From the onset they knew that it would be a special kind of love, one that cracks through the other's mind, body and soul. They had no stress about life's trials and tribulations because their bond was unique and delivered them through it all. Now time has passed and they've gone past months and years in each other's love, That Special Love, Olothando.\n\nThe project also has remixes by some of the world's most prominent producers, including Italian producer and Dj, Rame who is also part of the Pastaboys. His Mazuma mix interpretation journey's on a touch of that Old School House and a classic dance vibe which heals your soul. The French Twins and Koro from S\u00e9gou in Mali's Tantric Soul Mix defines poetry through music, not forgetting the Ancestral nature of it.\n\nOffering invites you to entice your listening to this release.

They are also called fruit bats, old world fruit bats, or, especially the genera Acerodon and Pteropus, flying foxes.\n\nMegabats, however contrary to their name, are not always large; the smallest species is 6 cm (2.4 in) long and thus smaller than some microbats. The largest attain a wingspan of 1.7 m (5.6 ft), weighing in at up to 1.6 kg. Most fruit bats have large eyes, allowing them to orient themselves visually in twilight and inside caves and forests.\n\nTheir sense of smell is excellent. In contrast to the microbats, the fruit bats do not use echolocation (with one exception, the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus egyptiacus, which uses high-pitched tongue clicks to navigate in caves).\n\nSource :- Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

For more information on how to eat real food, visit http://www.ThrillbillyGourmet.com. Thanks for visiting!\nMaking your own vanilla extract from scratch is simple - including only two ingredients Vodka or rum and real, fresh vanilla beans will allow you to produce your own exceptional, flavorful, real vanilla extract to use in any recipe you wish. Make your own homemade vanilla extract, and save money while capturing exceptional flavor.\nHey, Carolyn. You asked me about how to make homemade vanilla extract and I told you I would let you know. Here's how you do it. It's super easy. One thing you do want to do it is take the time to find a good source of vanilla beans. This are Madagascar vanilla beans and if you take a close look, you can see that they are still real moist, and they are pretty even and uniform. These are the good ones. The fragrance is out of this world. I swear, I put this in my drawers to scent my clothes like drier sheets.\n\nAnyway, take a vanilla bean, and this is how easy this is, and all you want to do it split it open, because we're going to infuse this. Here's what happens when you split it open. You see all that stuff? Those are seeds. They are absolutely gorgeous. If you're going to use the vanilla seeds in a recipe, say you're making a custard or you're doing ice cream or creme en glaze, then here's what you're next step would be - I'm going to do it to a part of this because we don't them need for this.\n\nTake your knife blade and start squishing them out. You see those? There they are all over my hand. That is the caviar of the desert roll. Absolutely fabulous. But in this case, we don't need to do that. I have discovered that for a 12-ounce bottle, I like to use about three beans. You can use leftovers. I actually found this place online where you can get dirt cheap bottles. I use it for all my homemade extracts and my infused oils and my vinegars and all the stuff that I've got cluttering up everywhere behind me. \n\nSo drop them in a bottle. Next is Vodka. Now you don't want to use the good stuff. You can, but there's no reason to. Any of the flavors that are fabulous and are top shelf vodka, you're really wasting it when you are infusing it with all these other intense flavors. They're simply going to take over. There's no reason, so just use the inexpensive stuff. You can also infuse all kinds of other flavors. You can do cinnamon and lavender. Okay. So that's it. Put a cork in it, set it aside and let it steep.\n\nThis one has been going for several weeks. It's not quite as dark as I want, but this is what's going to happen over the next few days. It's really fine. Every once in a while, give it a little shake. Here is what you want to see. See? This one is almost ready to use. Can you see all those little seeds that are floating around in there? That's it. As soon as it gets a little more opaque than that, you're ready to go.\n\nIt literally is a fraction of the cost of buying the good stuff in the stores. When you're baking, you always want to use real vanilla extract. It can get pretty expensive, especially if you bake a lot. So if you take a few minutes and make your own, you're ahead of the game there. Besides the flavor is like nothing else on the planet. I hope that helps and I hope you enjoy it.

In the last two years, she has undergone two breast implant surgeries -- taking her from an H to an O cup. And she has shrunk her waist from 38 to just 23 inches by squeezing herself into a tiny corset -- sometimes for up to 23 hours a day. This has resulted in\u00a0the 25-year-old's bust being TWICE the size of her waist!\u00a0Disturbingly, the corset can be so tight that when Australian-born Penny is wearing them she can only eat smaller meals -- because her stomach is so restricted. Bending, sitting and lying down can also be problematic and doing exercise or sports is completely off limits because she'd struggle to breathe properly. But, despite it all Penny, who lives in Okinawa, Japan, believes it's all worth it.\n\nVideographer / Director: Aflo\nProducer: Emma Pearson \nEditor: Joshua Douglas\n\nFor more amazing footage of the amazing side of life, visit the \nLike Barcroft TV on Facebook: http://goo.gl/7ayYgY\nFollow Barcroft TV on Twitter: http://bit.ly/10vFLY9\nFollow Barcroft TV on Instagram: http://bit.ly/1b84Ku0\nBarcroft Media website: http://bit.ly/19OYwp", "title": "Extreme Corseter Shrinks Waist From 38 to 23 Inches", "publishedDate": "2014-06-12T09:35:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "0qM9HExV1w8", "description": "INTERN CINES pr\u00e4sentiert eine neue Art von IMAGEFILM.\n\n\"Gymnasium im Schloss\" Wolfenb\u00fcttel.\nMehr INFOs unter www.gis-wf.de\n\nFACEBOOK: www.facebook.com/InternCines\nTWITTER: www.twitter.com/InternCines\n\n\u00a9 2013\nwww.interncines.de", "title": "Kennste Du schon das Gymnasium im Schloss?", "publishedDate": "2013-12-13T20:08:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "0qMJZuPZjGk", "description": "Trying to figure out the retirement landscape can be daunting.

Taken daily, NutriFeron strengthens immune response by boosting the body's natural interferon.*\n\nOur immune systems are under increasing attack, every day. The scientific and medical communities have identified interferon as critical to healthy immune function. Dr. Kojima, the world renowned immunologist who discovered interferon in 1954, spent 40 years searching for a natural interferon booster. The result of Dr. Kojima's work is the proprietary botanical blend in NutriFeron, the ONLY dietary supplement in the U.S. created by the discoverer of interferon that naturally increases the production of interferon in the body.* \n\nBreakthrough immune protection! \n\nExclusive patented formula providing our highest level of daily immune protection: \n \n-- The only supplement created by the discoverer of interferon \n-- Naturally increases levels of interferon \n-- Proven by 4 human clinical studies\n\nDr. Yasuhiko Kojima received his Doctor of Medical Science degree from Tokyo University in 1964. Before receiving his degree, he was employed at Tokyo University Institute of Medical Science. Dr. Kojima's experience also includes serving in senior advisory roles at Kitazato Pharmaceutical and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical. Currently, he is president and chairman of the board at The Interferon Herb Research Institute.\n\nIn 1954, Dr. Kojima and a colleague, Dr. Yasuichi Nagano, discovered interferon-inducing activities in Chinese herbal medicines. Since then, their groundbreaking insights have generated an enormous body of scientific literature on interferon, antiviral, and anticancer immune responses in animals and humans, now a burgeoning and active area of research. Dr. Kojima holds no fewer than 30 patents for interferon inducers and related processes as they relate to Chinese herbal medicines.\n\nhttp://Nutriferon.GetLivingHealthy.com", "title": "Boost Your Interferon with Nutriferon to Build Your Immune System", "publishedDate": "2010-10-07T16:49:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "0qjGRIjPwOU", "description": "Je m'appelle J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Gimenez, fondateur de Grenoble Paranormal et voici les voix que j'ai captur\u00e9 lors de ma toute premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eate au Parc Paul Mistral \u00e0 Grenoble (38) le 9 avril 2013. \n\nIl n'y a aucun trucage.\n\nAbonnez-vous \u00e0 ma cha\u00eene pour suivre mes futures enqu\u00eates! \n\nVous pouvez \u00e9galement me suivre sur Twitter : @Jeremie_Gimenez\n\nJ'attends vos commentaires!! \n\n\u00c0 bient\u00f4t!", "title": "Grenoble Paranormal #1 - Parc Paul Mistral - Grenoble", "publishedDate": "2013-04-21T22:55:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "0qjWOoZaU8M", "description": "Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda.

I own a lot of jackets and it's safe to say I've never been this excited about one; actually two, as you're about to find out. Enter: Columbia's Back To Hells Mountain Interchange Jacket.\n\n[vid]\n\nLike the title says, this is an interchangeable jacket. I'm usually not a fan of zip-in liners, but I'm making a big exception here.\n\nBy itself, the outer-jacket is Omni-Tech. That means waterproof and breathable: everything want and expect in a technical outer layer.\n\nInside the Hells Mountain Jacket you'll find a down-filled acrylic/wool blend. The Back To Hells Mountain Interchange Jacket I'm reviewing is actually packed with a polyester / recycled polyester. Yup, no skimping here.\n\nA Liner With Serious Technology\n\nI've been wearing the liner jacket by itself for around town milling about and hikes through the snow. It's plenty warm and is no where near being too technical looking for a date with my wife. Two chest pockets carry everything I need.\n\nAs if all this wasn't enough, Columbia topped off the liner's interior with Omni-heat. What's Omni-Heat you ask? You see those silly-looking reflective dots on the inside?\n\nThose serious bits of technology reflect your body heat back onto itself, allowing you to be warmer for a lighter weight piece of clothing. And it really works! I stood outdoors at the World Skiing Freestyle Competition with high winds and cold temperatures and I was toasty the entire time.\n\nOmni-Tech Shell\n\nThe shell sheds rain and melting snow, wether from the clouds or the annoying ski lift cable above you. (I need to remember not to sit under it on warm days.) If you get hot, open the underarm vents. For a vertical foot challenge at Park City's Canyons Resort I competed in a vertical challenge. Underneath this jacket I only wore an Omni-Heat baselayer and I was perfectly warm on the lift and the trail.\n\nInside you'll find a media pocket that allows you to pass a headphone cable into the phone without worry about your phone falling out.

But, like in any game, unexpected variables can break into life, too.\n\nIf we could carefully observe our existences from the outside, even just for one day,\nwe could easily reduce them to a mere collection of habitual gestures and acts,\nmonotonous and repetitive, in which the emotional aspect is drastically relegated to\nthe background. Man has always had an immense need for leisure and\nentertainment: these moments, often extremely short-lived, are the only\nopportunities to escape, even just for a few minutes, a condition generally\ncharacterized by boredom and apathy.\nIn modern times, this appetite is satisfied by a series of instruments like theatre,\ncinema, television, radio. Today, more than in the past, the form of entertainment that\nseems to catalyse people's attention at best is gambling: the number of lotteries has\nincreased exponentially; slot machines have gradually invaded almost every social\nspace; at any time, it is possible to gamble on a multitude of sport events and on any\nsort of happenings; casinos are now virtual places: to reach one of them, we need\njust a computer and an internet connection.\nGambling has two peculiar effects on the individual: on one hand, it contributes to\nthe achievement of a state of psychological and physiological satisfaction, above all\nby promoting an abundant production of adrenaline and and noradrenaline; on the\nother hand, it often offers the chance of a change, through the win of a cash prize: a\nsimple pastime subtly turns into the only way for the individual to improve his life.", "title": "And the winner is...

Ruddy\nScreenwriter: Francis Ford Coppola, Mario Puzo\nFilm Description: Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a \"godfather\" or \"don,\" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family \"business.\" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels.\n\n\"the godfather\",\"the godfather clip\",\"the godfather theme\",\"the godfather part 1\",\"al pacino\",\"robert duvall\",\"james caan\",\"abe vigoda\",\"richard s castellano\",\"francis ford coppola\",\"classic dramas\",\"20th century period pieces\",blockbusters,classics,\"crime dramas\",\"dramas based on bestsellers\",\"dramas based on the book\",mobster,\"period pieces\",\"gray frederickson\",\"albert s ruddy\",\"family videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++20076,/m/0252fh,/m/04yyk9,/m/015c4g,/m/0bj9k,/m/02l0p0", "title": "It's Strictly Business - The Godfather (2/9) Movie CLIP (1972) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-22T16:57:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "0qwIkCPvU2Y", "description": "*Best Moments* Jennifer Lawrence @ Rome Film Festival (Red Carpet) with Liam Hemsworth and Josh  Hutcherson.\nPremiere \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" 14/11/13", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence @ Rome Film Festival Red Carpet", "publishedDate": "2013-11-14T20:07:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "0qwPOfkTLCY", "description": "8/25/09  RetroFit Foam Insulation", "title": "8/25/09  RetroFit Foam Insulation", "publishedDate": "2009-08-28T17:20:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "0qwQIExFWzA", "description": "Vandaag een iets andere video..", "title": "Doei Jumbo! #NIELSMOVIE", "publishedDate": "2012-08-28T12:11:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "0qwSDn_MEgA", "description": "Tweet @BurnleyOfficial with your vote for the 2013 goal of the year...\n\nDanny INGS v Derby County\nJunior STANISLAS v Blackburn Rovers\nDanny INGS v Nottingham Forest\nDanny INGS v QPR\nScott ARFIELD v Blackpool", "title": "BFC Shortlist for Mitre Goal of the Year 2013", "publishedDate": "2014-01-22T12:15:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "0qw_skmqs1g", "description": "How long does it take to core a pineapple?

Lefkowitz MD, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator who has spent his entire 39-year research career at the Duke University Medical Center, is sharing the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Brian K. Kobilka of Stanford University School of Medicine, who was a post-doctoral fellow in Lefkowitz's lab in the 1980s.\n\nThey are being recognized for their work on a class of cell surface receptors that have become the target of prescription drugs, including antihistamines, ulcer drugs and beta blockers to relieve hypertension, angina and coronary disease.\n\nThe receptors catch chemical signals from the outside and transmit their messages into the cell, providing the cell with information about changes occurring within the body. These particular receptors are called seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors, or just \"G-coupled receptors\" for short. Serpentine in appearance, G-coupled receptors weave through the surface of the cell seven times.\n\nThe human genome contains code to make at least 1,000 different forms of these trans-membrane receptors, all of which are quite similar. The receptors also bear a strong resemblance to receptors that detect light in the eyes, smells in the nose and taste on the tongue. \n\n\"Bob's seminal discoveries related to G-protein coupled receptors ultimately became the basis for a great many medications that are in use today across many disease areas,\" said Victor J. Dzau, MD, Chancellor for Health Affairs and CEO, Duke University Health System.  \"He is an outstanding example of a physician-scientist whose impact can be seen in the lives of the countless patients who have benefited from his scientific discoveries. We are very proud of his magnificent achievements and grateful for his many contributions to Duke Medicine.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled that the Nobel Committee has recognized Bob's incredible body of work, and very proud that he has been on our faculty for his entire career,\" said Nancy Andrews, MD, PhD, Dean, Duke University School of Medicine. \"Bob is not just an extraordinary scientist but also a remarkable mentor; he has had a profound influence on the careers of more than 200 students and postdoctoral fellows.\"\n\nIn addition to being one of the longest-serving Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators in history (36 years), Lefkowitz is famous on the Duke campus for the attention he gives to mentoring his students. His lab has produced more than 200 graduate students and post-docs, including R. Sanders \"Sandy\" Williams, who later became his dean at Duke, and several researchers who went on to become HHMI investigators themselves. Lefkowitz is a professor of biochemistry, immunology and medicine, and also a basic research cardiologist in the Duke Heart Center.\n\nAmong his students was Brian Kobilka, with whom he is sharing the Nobel Prize. Kobilka was a post-doctoral fellow in cardiology at Duke from 1984 to 1989 and part of Lefkowitz's lab. He joined the faculty of medicine and molecular and cellular physiology at Stanford in 1990.\n \nThey will receive the Nobel Prize in Stockholm at a Dec. 10 ceremony.", "title": "Duke's Robert Lefkowitz shares in chemistry Nobel Prize", "publishedDate": "2012-10-10T21:53:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "0r4jKkcDA7E", "description": "Via Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10203312365625652", "title": "Hong Kong police pepper spray elderly protester at point blank range", "publishedDate": "2014-09-28T11:44:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "0r4jd_y__KY", "description": "nubian twists prerequisite nubian twists prerequisite on half white black man nubian twists prerequisite on half white black man  \"White People (Ethnicity)\" and black people too  \"Black People (Ethnicity)\"", "title": "nubian twists prerequisite on half white black man after yelling outside happy?", "publishedDate": "2012-06-30T17:15:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "0r53oZA00Mc", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "Jade Plant", "publishedDate": "2013-09-10T12:21:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "0r5BilZ-1Xs", "description": "The best conveyancing in liverpool.

Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals. For animals, mating strategies include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of mating and artificially inseminating domesticated animals is part of animal husbandry.\n\nAnimals Mating With Human For Real : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvFiHQw-Dow1WprxW0rO7pw?sub_confirmation=1\n\nLast Search:\nAnimals Mating Hard And Fast With Other Animals\nAnimals Mating Like Humans For Real\nAnimals Mating Up Close Compilation\nHorse Mating With Donkey, Zebra, Mule Documentary\n\nAnimals Mating,animals mating with human for real,Animals Mating Videos,Animals Mating Hard And Fast,Animals Mating With Other Animals,Animals Mating Compilations,Animals Mating Up Close,Animals Mating Like Humans animals,\nanimals history,\nanimals pictures,\nanimals videos,\ndoggie videos,\ndogs,\ndogs 101,\npet videos,\nvideo of wild animals,\nwild life animals,\nwildanimals,\nwildlife videos,\nwildlife videos of animals,\nwith animals,\narabian horse,\ndog breeding videos,\nfacts about horses,\nhorse facts,\nhorse matting,\nhorses,\nhorses for kids,\nhorses for sale,\ninformation about horses,\npet videos,\nthoroughbred horses,\nthoroughbreds for sale,\nvideos of horses,", "title": "BIG Elephant Mating Close Up Har And Fast - Animals Mating Like Humans For Real", "publishedDate": "2014-10-18T02:43:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "0rBCT5ROfNQ", "description": "\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30b9MACROSS 82-99\nhttps://soundcloud.com/macross-82-99", "title": "\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30b9MACROSS 82-99 - Horsey (feat.

The lyrics of the song mention rock and roll and the desire for rhythm and blues to replace classical music. The song has been covered by many other artists and Rolling Stone ranked it #97 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n\"Roll Over Beethoven\" is one of the most widely covered songs in popular music --\"a staple of rock & roll bands\" according to Koda -- with notable versions by Jerry Lee Lewis, The Beatles and the Electric Light Orchestra. Other covers were made by Mountain, Ten Years After, Raul Seixas, Leon Russell, Status Quo, The Rolling Stones, The Byrds, The 13th Floor Elevators, The Sonics, Wes Paul, Gene Vincent, Quartz, Uriah Heep, Kickhunter, Johnny Rivers and Iron Maiden.\n\n\"Roll Over Beethoven\" was a favourite of John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison even before they had chosen \"The Beatles\" as their name, and they continued to play it live right into their American tours of 1964. Their version of \"Roll Over Beethoven\" was recorded on 30 July 1963 for their second British LP, With The Beatles, and features George Harrison on vocals and guitar. In the United States, it was released 10 April 1964 as the opening track of The Beatles' Second Album.\n\nIn 1994, The Beatles released a live version of \"Roll Over Beethoven\" on Live at the BBC. This live version was recorded on 28 February 1964 and broadcast on 30 March 1964 as part of a BBC series starring The Beatles called From Us to You. This version of \"Roll Over Beethoven\" was used in the film Superman III directed by Richard Lester who also directed The Beatles' first two films, Help! and A Hard Day's Night.\n\nThe Rutles' song \"Blue Suede Schubert\" is based on The Beatles' cover of this song.\n\n\"Roll Over Beethoven\" is the second single released by the Electric Light Orchestra. It became their second consecutive top ten hit in the UK, as well as a hit in the United States when an edited version of the track was taken from the album ELO 2 in 1973. ELO's elaborate eight-minute reworking of the track included an opening musical quote from Beethoven's Fifth Symphony and clever interpolations of material from the symphony's first movement into Berry's song; the band closed all their concerts using this number, their signature song. The B-side Queen of the Hours was the first ever ELO published song, released by Harvest Records in November 1971 in a compilation called The Harvest Bag which featured various Harvest records artists.\n\nMeat Loaf has performed many rock covers for his concerts throughout his career, including Chuck Berry songs. His covers of \"Roll Over Beethoven\" have been in his \"Rock Medleys\" of Elvis, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard favorites. Though a cover was never officially released into the medley, being edited out of the CD recording of the tour, it has been on one of Meat Loaf's Objects in the Rear View Mirror singles, recorded for VH-1 in the early 90's according to the CD jacket.\n\nIron Maiden included a cover of the Berry song on the B-side of their single \"From Here to Eternity\", called \"Roll Over Vic Vella\". The song features different lyrics (written by Steve Harris) about the band's long-time tour manager, Vic Vella.\n\nNarvel Felts covered the song in 1982. His version went to #64 on the Hot Country Singles charts in 1982.", "title": "The Beatles - Roll Over Beethoven (with Jimmy Nicol)", "publishedDate": "2010-11-28T08:26:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "0rLiHtAuzkE", "description": "Enjoy!! :D \n\nI like this song!\n\n(Lyrics later)\n\n(I do not own this song or these clips!

Their full dance routine is actually about a minute longer than in the video.\n\nAlso this video would not have been possible without my friend Jacob Stark. He was the one who came to me with the idea and the contact info for the dancers.

Generally speaking during this time there are a lot of people walking through here, but we had people at all the busy doors, and they asked the people coming in to use the other entrances to make the building look empty, otherwise there would have been a lot more people walking through :)\n\nI shot the video on my Canon 5D Mark II at 24fps, except for a couple slow motion shots. The slowmotion shots I filmed with my friend's Canon 7D, at 60fps.\n\nI used a Canon 16-35mm F/2.8 L series lens for all the wide \"flying shots\".\nAnd I used a Canon 70-200mm F/2.8 L series lens for all of the tight shots.\n\nAs far as making the camera look like it was \"flying\", I used a Glidecam 2000 HD for all those shots.

All it needs is the laryngoscope and the specially designed mini version of the laparoscopic band applicator. The abdomen is opened till the sheath and the peritoneum is torn open with fingers (like in the Missgav Ladakh technique). This ensures that the bladder is not accidentally opened. The laryngoscope is now inserted and the abdominal wall is lifted up.  The laryngoscope thus provides retraction, illumination and pneumoperitonium all at one go. The tubes are readily visualized and need not be hooked out of the abdomen. This avoids avulsion. Bands may now be applied at the isthmus with or without holding the tubes with the Babcock's forceps. The abdomen is close by suturing only the sheath and the skin. All this makes the procedure less painful, quick, less traumatic for the tube and allows the best chances of reversal if need be.  Soon one becomes so adept at the procedure that it becomes as quick as laparoscopic sterilization. It may be called 'poor man's laparoscopy'.", "title": "Tubectomy using a specially designed band applicator and a Laryngoscope", "publishedDate": "2013-09-14T04:17:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "0rQEctxkjBM", "description": "Using the Magnetic Lasso Tool in Photoshop CC. \nSubscribe to Creative Bloq for more: http://goo.gl/H1hn3\n\nThis handy tool enables you to make selections that snap onto the object you're trying to select.

Martin, MD, FACS\nPerelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania\nPhiladelphia, PA, USA\n\nCase presented in an invited faculty lecture at the TJU hTEE course, May 16, 2013.\n\nThe patient. A 72 year old male pedestrian was stuck by a motor vehicle and suffered multiple severe orthopedic injuries: fractures of both lower extremities, an acetabulum, ribs, and spinal column fractures. As a result, he suffered severe deconditioning resulting in ventilator-dependent respiratory failure and required a tracheostomy. The patient was ultimately discharged to a long term acute care hospital (LTACH) after several weeks.\n\nRe-admission to hospital. The patient was subsequently readmitted for increasing anasarca, progressive hypotension, and hypoxia. He was presumed to have septic shock, likely of pulmonary origin. He met criteria for ARDS. He quickly required multiple pressors (neosynephrine, norepinephrine and vasopressin) and developed high mean airway pressures.\n\nEchocardiography history. An echocardiogram during the previous admission had revealed a slightly reduced ejection fraction (35-40%), moderate to severe LV hypertrophy, and normal RV size and function.\n\nWhy hTEE? The patient suffered progressive oliguria from sepsis-induced acute kidney injury. He continued to have severe anasarca, and had a CVP of 20 mmHg. The patient was initially given lasix, a standard treatment for anasarca and pulmonary edema seen on chest x-ray, but he did not respond. TTE was not possible due to absence of windows (body habitus, ventilator settings and anasarca). hTEE was therefore placed.\n\nhTEE results. hTEE revealed a depressed and under-filled LV, and a moderately dilated RV with severely depressed function, significantly worse as compared to his previous admission's echocardiogram.\n \nResolution. Following the hTEE diagnosis of bi-ventricular depression but especially the newly dilated and poorly functioning RV, inhaled prostacyclin was administered to reduce RV afterload, and neosynephrine and vasopressin were replaced by epinephrine to increase RV contraction. Management was guided by serial, near continuous hTEE assessment. Under this changed management, one saw improved RV function resulting in better LV filling and new urine output.\n\nConclusions. RV dysfunction is common in septic shock1 and ARDS2. LV depression is also common in shock3. The role of TEE in critical care is well-established 4-5, especially the role of a focused TEE exam in the differential diagnosis of the causes of shock6, which served as the foundation of the three-view hTEE exam. Here hTEE identified RV afterload as one main causes of the patient's cardiac dysfunction, c.f. ref. 3, and helped guide its management and resolution through near continuous serial assessment.\n\nReferences.\n1.

The earliest fossil records are currently restricted to the Late Triassic and often dated to 227 million years ago (Mya). As these early records include taxa that are relatively derived in their morphology (e.g. Brachyrhinodon), an earlier unknown history of Lepidosauria is implied. However, molecular age estimates for Lepidosauria have been problematic; dates for the most recent common ancestor of all lepidosaurs range between approximately 226 and 289 Mya whereas estimates for crown-group Squamata (lizards and snakes) vary more dramatically: 179 to 294 Mya. This uncertainty restricts inferences regarding the patterns of diversification and evolution of Lepidosauria as a whole. Results: Here we report on a rhynchocephalian fossil from the Middle Triassic of Germany (Vellberg) that represents the oldest known record of a lepidosaur from anywhere in the world. Reliably dated to 238--240 Mya, this material is at least 11 million years older than previously known lepidosaur records and is older than some but not all molecular clock estimates for the origin of lepidosaurs. Using RAG1 sequence data from 77 extant taxa and the new fossil specimens two of several calibrations, we estimate that the most recent common ancestor of Lepidosauria lived at least 242 Mya (238--249.5), and crown-group Squamata originated around 193 Mya (176--213). Conclusion: A Early/Middle Triassic date for the origin of Lepidosauria disagrees with previous estimates deep within the Permian and suggests the group evolved as part of the faunal recovery after the end-Permain mass extinction as the climate became more humid. Our origin time for crown-group Squamata coincides with shifts towards warmer climates and dramatic changes in fauna and flora. Most major subclades within Squamata originated in the Cretaceous postdating major continental fragmentation. The Vellberg fossil locality is expected to become an important resource for providing a more balanced picture of the Triassic and for bridging gaps in the fossil record of several other major vertebrate groups.", "title": "Triassic origin for Lepidosauria (lizards, snakes, and tuatara) - Movie 2", "publishedDate": "2013-10-21T23:19:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "0rn9SP1EvEY", "description": "Label and copyright: Marina Viskovic/City Records\nZabranjeno svako kopiranje video i/ili audio snimaka i postavljanje na druge kanale!\n\n\nMusic:Dragan Brajovi\u0107 Braja\nlyrics:Dragan Brajovi\u0107 Braja\nArr:Dejan Abadi\u0107", "title": "Marina Viskovic - Bez duse - (Audio 2013) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-03-31T22:37:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "0rnWgzuhjsM", "description": "Try Rocket Portuguese For Free!\nhttp://tinyurl.com/q5ksh4g\nSign up now to get instant online access to the Rocket Portuguese Premium course for 6 days, PLUS, six daily emails full of hints and tips to guide you through making the most of your course!\n\nThe Rocket Portuguese 6 Day Free trial is your ticket to discovering how well the Rocket Languages system will get you speaking and understanding Portuguese like a native, while cutting your learning time by up to 50%!\n\nMost of the lexicon of Portuguese is derived from Latin. Nevertheless, because of the Moorish occupation of the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages, and the participation of Portugal in the Age of Discovery, it has adopted loanwords from all over the world.\nVery few Portuguese words can be traced to the pre-Roman inhabitants of Portugal, which included the Gallaeci, Lusitanians, Celtici and Cynetes. The Phoenicians and Carthaginians, briefly present, also left some scarce traces. Some notable examples are ab\u00f3bora \"pumpkin\" and bezerro \"year-old calf\", from the nearby Celtiberian language (probably through the Celtici); cerveja \"beer\", from Celtic; through Latin \"cervisia.\"\nIn the 5th century, the Iberian Peninsula (the Roman Hispania) was conquered by the Germanic Suebi and Visigoths. As they adopted the Roman civilization and language, however, these people contributed only a few words to the lexicon, mostly related to warfare\u2014such as espora \"spur\", estaca \"stake\", and guerra \"war\", from Gothic *spa\u00fara, *stakka, and *wirro, respectively. The influence also exists in toponymic surnames and patronymic surnames borne by Visigoth sovereigns and their descendants, and it dwells on placenames such has Ermesinde, Esposende and Resende where sinde and sende are derived from the Germanic \"sinths\" (military expedition) and in the case of Resende, the prefix re comes from Germanic \"reths\" (council).\nBetween the 9th and 13th centuries, Portuguese acquired about 900 words from Arabic by influence of Moorish Iberia. They are often recognizable by the initial Arabic article a(l)-, and include many common words such as aldeia \"village\" from \u0627\u0644\u0636\u064a\u0639\u0629 al\u1e0dai`a (or from Edictum Rothari: aldii, aldias),[80] alface \"lettuce\" from \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0633 alkhass, armaz\u00e9m \"warehouse\" from \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u0632\u0646 almakhzan, and azeite \"olive oil\" from \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a azzait. From Arabic came also the grammatically peculiar word oxal\u00e1 \u0625\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \"hopefully\". The Mozambican currency name metical was derived from the word \u0645\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644 mitq\u0101l, a unit of weight. The word Mozambique itself is from the Arabic name of sultan Mu\u00e7a Alebique (Musa Alibiki).\nStarting in the 15th century, the Portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from Asian languages. For instance, catana \"cutlass\" from Japanese katana and ch\u00e1 \"tea\" from Chinese ch\u00e1.\nFrom South America came batata \"potato\", from Taino; anan\u00e1s and abacaxi, from Tupi--Guarani nan\u00e1 and Tupi ib\u00e1 cati, respectively (two species of pineapple), and tucano \"toucan\" from Guarani tucan.\n\nPortuguese language schools\nPortuguese language software\nPortuguese language training\nPortuguese lesson\nPortuguese lessons\nPortuguese names\nPortuguese online\nPortuguese phrases\nPortuguese school\nPortuguese software\nPortuguese translate\nPortuguese translation\nPortuguese translations\nPortuguese translator\nPortuguese tutor\nPortuguese vocabulary\nPortuguese words\nPortuguese writing\nlearn basic Portuguese\nlearn how to speak Portuguese\nlearn Portuguese\nstudy Portuguese\nstudy Portuguese language\nteach me Portuguese", "title": "Portuguese lessons for speakers of English", "publishedDate": "2013-12-14T09:34:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "0roCjEoFe60", "description": "Seelandcup U21 Biel vs Schu\u0308pfen 07-09-2014 ohne Penalties", "title": "Seelandcup U21 UHC Biel-Seeland vs. WW Schu\u0308pfen-Busswil 07-09-2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-07T22:59:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "0roCyK2fLUs", "description": "Watch the teaser for Episode 3 where Chrissy Teigen visits Leuven, Belgium to learn about the history and heritage behind Stella Artois. http://www.stellaartois.com\n\nWatch as Chrissy pairs hand-crafted mussels with Stella Artois, learns about Belgian hospitality and soaks in Leuven\u2019s rich culture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKBTylR4mw&list=PLbjg0u-xHzk1u1LHWo-KXhiUiuYGBBjZA&index=4", "title": "Episode 3 Teaser: Stella Artois - The Butcher, The Baker, The Belgian Beer Maker", "publishedDate": "2014-08-20T21:26:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "0roDniAzd28", "description": "Ein etwa 2 m hoher Busch Zwergflieder \"Palibin\" mit hellen Bl\u00fcten w\u00e4chst im Botanischen Garten Augsburg am 21.

The fixed link passes by Hustadvika, an unsheltered part of the Norwegian Sea, connecting the island of Aver\u00f8y with the mainland and Romsdalshalv\u00f8ya peninsula. The road runs between the villages of K\u00e5rv\u00e5g on Aver\u00f8y and Vevang in Eida. The road is built on several small islands and skerries, which are connected by several causeways, viaducts and eight bridges\u2014the most prominent being Storseisundet Bridge.\n\nThe route was originally proposed as a railway line in the early 20th century, but this was ultimately abandoned. Serious planning of the road started in the 1970s, and construction started on 1 August 1983. During construction, the area was hit by twelve hurricanes. The road was opened on 7 July 1989, having cost 122 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which 25 percent was financed with tolls and the rest from public grants. Collection of tolls was scheduled to run for 15 years, but by June 1999 the road was paid off and the toll removed. The road is preserved as a cultural heritage site and is classified as a National Tourist Route. It is a popular site to film automotive commercials, has been declared the world's best road trip, and been awarded the title as \"Norwegian Construction of the Century\". In 2009, the Atlantic Ocean Tunnel opened from Aver\u00f8y to Kristiansund; combined, they have become a second fixed link between Kristiansund and Molde.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean Road is a 8.274-kilometer (5.141 mi) long section of County Road 64 which connects the island and municipality of Aver\u00f8y with the mainland at Eide. The road runs across an archipelago of partially inhabited islands and skerries. To the north lies Hustadvika, an unsheltered section of the Norwegian Sea, while to the south lies Lauv\u00f8yfjorden. The road has a width of 6.5 meters (21 ft) and a maximum gradient of eight percent. It consists of eight bridges and four resting places accommodated as viewpoints. Several tourist sites, including dining, fishing and scuba diving resorts, have been established on the islands. Along with the section from Vevang to Bud, the Atlantic Ocean Road has been designated one of eighteen National Tourist Routes.", "title": "What a Driving Atlantic Highway", "publishedDate": "2012-12-28T06:00:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "0rupQ6wlUCQ", "description": "Spearmint and caraway get their smell from the same molecule - well, almost the same.

This simple classic was made famous in the 1950s by President John F. Kennedy who proclaimed it to be his favorite cocktail.\n\nClassic Daiquiri\nThe daiquiri is the perfect rum-savouring cocktail as the sugar and lime take the harsh edge off the rum and enhance the flavour, bringing the caramels and spices to the forefront.

And if we do, then one year from now not only would our economy and our security be stronger, but maybe the best and the brightest from around the world who come to study here would stay and create jobs here. Maybe companies that play by the rules will no longer be undercut by companies that don't. Maybe more families who have been living here for years, whose children are often U.S. citizens, who are our neighbors and our friends, and whose children are our -- our kids' friends and go to school with them and play on ball teams with them, maybe those families would get to stay together.\n\nBut much of this only happens if Americans continue to push Congress to get this done. So I've told Speaker Boehner that even as I take those steps that I can within my existing legal authorities to make the immigration system work better, I'm going to continue to reach out to House Republicans in the hope that they deliver a more permanent solution with a comprehensive bill. Maybe it will be after the midterms, when they're less worried about politics. Maybe it will be next year. Whenever it is, they will find me a willing partner.\n\n\nI have been consistent in saying that I am prepared to work with them even on a bill that I don't consider perfect, and the Senate bill was a good example of the capacity to compromise and get this done. The only thing I can't do is stand by and do nothing while waiting for them to get their act together.", "title": "Obama on Immigration executive order: I can't stand by and do nothing", "publishedDate": "2014-06-30T20:23:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "0s6-fPQxsF8", "description": "If you enjoyed the video then click the 'LIKE' button.\nSUBSCRIBE! - http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ARabidPigeon\n\nConnect with me on Twitter!\nhttps://twitter.com/A_Rabid_Pigeon\n\nVideo Info:\nMetal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes played on: Playstation 4\nRecorded with: Hauppauge HD PVR 2\nEdited with: Sony Vegas Pro 10.0", "title": "Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes - MGS Peace Walker Medley - Heavens Divide", "publishedDate": "2014-03-22T07:06:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "0s62ehGBRns", "description": "Theo 100 skit", "title": "St Augustine Of Hippo", "publishedDate": "2013-04-29T02:52:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "0s6IEmaf0x0", "description": "Two binturongs in Dierenpark de Wissel, Epe.

One of the main reasons for the difficulty in identifying the Dark-necked Tailorbird lies in its similarity to the Common Tailorbird (Orthotomus sutorius), since both birds have rufous crowns, greenish upperparts, dark-speckled throat areas and long tails. The main differences between the two species lie in very subtle differences, the most immediately distinguishable of which is the colour of the rump and vent since the Common Tailorbird has a white rump and vent while the Dark-necked Tailorbird has a yellow vent. Other distinguishing features include the fact that the Dark-necked Tailorbird's throat area is more solidly coloured black compared to the Common Tailorbird, for whom the dark streaks are less extensive, as well as the presence of a white stripe running above the eye (supercilium) in the case of the Common Tailorbird, which is absent in the Dark-necked Tailorbird. Additionally, the Dark-necked Tailorbird has a brighter rufous crown and a shorter tail relative to the Common Tailorbird, although identifying such features would usually require a trained eye.\nCall:\nDark-necked Tailorbird (Source: xeno-canto.org). http://nusavifauna.wordpress.com/.../dark-necked-tailorbird/", "title": "Dark-necked Tailorbird Nesting-Singapore", "publishedDate": "2014-02-14T17:19:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "0sAg9ZFlD7Y", "description": "Dr CARRO Completar \u00d3leo Cambio Picasso facebook http://www.facebook.com/doutorcarro\ntwitter http://www.twitter.com/doutorcarro\nNosso Site http://www.doutorcarro.com.br", "title": "Dr CARRO Completar \u00d3leo Cambio Picasso e outros Franceses", "publishedDate": "2011-04-09T13:04:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "0sAtTtxClbk", "description": "Cara Pakai Shawl Glitter Macam Comel Jer..\nTonton Tutorial lain disini: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKh5fDdg6c4\n\n\n\nCara Pakai Selendang Terkini Gaya Diana Amir\nCara pakai selendang terkini gaya Ayu Raudhah\nCara Pakai Selendang Gaya Zara Zya 2014 by imasahaja\nLong Shawl Tutorial by Anggun Zara -

Native blood flow is restricted by the narrowing or the occlusion of the coronary arteries due to atheroma. To provide blood flow, grafts need to be sutured to native coronary vessels below the diseased segment. To date, the best graft known are the mammary arteries.\nSuture techniques enable surgeons to use graft length so as to perform complete mammary revascularisation. Suture techniques vary depending on the location of the coronary artery, the number of arteries to bypass, and the graft length available.\n\nThis video is an introduction to the course.\n\nThis video is part of an online course on coronary anastomosis composed of 15 videos (existing in English and French versions) reviewing the different existing techniques of coronary anastomosis.\n\nFirst presenting the interests of complete mammary revacularisation, this course will be successively focused on:\n\u27a2 The technique of mammary harvesting \n\u27a2 The techniques to expose the coronary vessel that will be grafted. \n\u27a2 How to do a Y anastomosis, i.e, an anastomosis between the right and the left mammary artery \n\u27a2 How to do the end-to-side anastomosis in a classical and in a diamond shaped manner \n\u27a2 How to do the side-to-side anastomosis,which can be :\n\u2022 Classical \n\u2022 Diamond-Shaped \n\u2022 Inverted Diamond-Shaped \n\u27a2 The combination of the different techniques to achieve complete mammary revascularisation. \n\u27a2 The course ends with a presentation of control coronary angiograms.\n\nDEFINITIONS \n\u2022 An End-to-Side anastomosis is an anastomosis between the end of the gaft and the side of the native coronary artery. \n\u2022 A Side-to-Side anastomosis is an anastomosis between the side of the gaft and the side of the native coronary artery. It enables to bypass numerous vessels with one single graft. \n\u2022 An anastomosis is called \u00ab CLASSICAL \u00bb if the graft and the native coronary artery are parallel. When performing the anastomosis, the heel of the graft corresponds to the heel of the native coronary artery. \n\u2022 An anastomosis is called \u00ab DIAMOND-SHAPED \u00bb if the graft and the native coronary artery are perpendicular. When performing the anastomosis, the heel of the graft corresponds to the side of the native coronary artery. \n\u2022 An anastomosis is called \u00ab INVERTED DIAMOND-SHAPED \u00bb if the graft opening is perpendicular to the big axis of the graft. When performing the anastomosis, the heel of the graft corresponds to the heel of the native coronary artery, but once the anastomosis is performed, the graft is perpendicular to the native coronary artery due to the axis of the opening.", "title": "01-INTRODUCTION TO THE COURSE ON CORONARY ANASTOMOSES", "publishedDate": "2013-10-30T09:49:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "0sOq6Rrre7c", "description": "Music video by The Vaccines performing Wreckin' Bar (Ra Ra Ra).

It is one of the most abundant enzymes synthetized in cells.

SOD, with Catalase (CAT) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), belongs to the class of primary antioxidants. These three enzymes control the first steps of the free radicals cascade production. They constitute the body's own internal antioxidant defense system. Thanks to their activity of first line of antioxidant defenses, SOD, CAT, and GPx provide the best protection against daily oxidative attacks.\n\nBionov, only industrial producer of 100% natural and bioactive SOD from melon (Cucumis melo L.), has shown that melon SOD, taken orally, induces the expression of the three endogenous antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and GPx.

Elephant Back Ride Safari is the most heavily promoted tour offered at Chitwan National Park.\n\nThe Asian or Asiatic elephant (Elephas maximus) is the only living species of the genus Elephas and is distributed in Southeast Asia from India in the west to Borneo in the east. Three subspecies are recognized\u2014Elephas maximus maximus from Sri Lanka, the Indian elephant or E. m. indicus from mainland Asia, and E. m. sumatranus from the island of Sumatra. Asian elephants are the largest living land animals in Asia.\n\nSince 1986, E. maximus has been listed as endangered by IUCN as the population has declined by at least 50% over the last three generations, estimated to be 60\u201375 years. The species is primarily threatened by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation. In 2003, the wild population was estimated at between 41,410 and 52,345 individuals. Female captive elephants have lived beyond 60 years when kept in seminatural situations, such as forest camps. In zoos, elephants die at a much younger age and are declining due to a low birth and high death rate.\n\nChitwan National Park is the first national park in Nepal. It was established in 1973 and granted the status of a World Heritage Site in 1984. It covers an area of 932 km2 (360 sq mi) and is located in the subtropical Inner Terai lowlands of south-central Nepal in the Chitwan District. In altitude it ranges from about 100 m (330 ft) in the river valleys to 815 m (2,674 ft) in the Churia Hills.\n\nIn the north and west of the protected area the Narayani-Rapti river system forms a natural boundary to human settlements. Adjacent to the east of Chitwan National Park is Parsa Wildlife Reserve, contiguous in the south is the Indian Tiger Reserve Valmiki National Park. The coherent protected area of 2,075 km2 (801 sq mi) represents the Tiger Conservation Unit (TCU) Chitwan-Parsa-Valmiki, which covers a 3,549 km2 (1,370 sq mi) huge block of alluvial grasslands and subtropical moist deciduous forests.\n\nNepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked sovereign nation located in South Asia. With an area of 147,181 square kilometres (56,827 sq mi) and a population of approximately 27 million. Nepal is the world's 93rd largest country by land mass and the 41st most populous country. It is located in the Himalayas and bordered to the north by the People's Republic of China, and to the south, east, and west by the Republic of India. Specifically, the Indian states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Sikkim border Nepal, while across the Himalayas lies the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Nepal is separated from Bangladesh by the narrow Indian Siliguri Corridor. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest metropolis.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Nowruz is also widely referred to as the Persian New Year. \n\nNowruz is celebrated and observed by Iranian peoples and the related cultural continent and has spread in many other parts of the world, including parts of Central Asia, South Asia, Northwestern China, the Crimea and some groups in the Balkans.\n\nNowruz marks the first day of spring and the beginning of the year in Iranian calendar. It is celebrated on the day of the astronomical vernal equinox, which usually occurs on March 21 or the previous/following day depending on where it is observed. As well as being a Zoroastrian holiday and having significance amongst the Zoroastrian ancestors of modern Iranians, the same time is celebrated in parts of the South Asian sub-continent as the new year. The moment the Sun crosses the celestial equator and equalizes night and day is calculated exactly every year and Iranian families gather together to observe the rituals.\n\nOriginally being a Zoroastrian festival, and the holiest of them all, Nowruz is believed to have been invented by Zoroaster himself, although there is no clear date of origin. Since the Achaemenid era the official year has begun with the New Day when the Sun leaves the zodiac of Pisces and enters the zodiacal sign of Aries, signifying the Spring Equinox.\n\nThe Jewish festival of Purim is probably adopted from the Persian New Year.  It is also a holy day for Sufis, Ismailis, Alawites,  Alevis, and adherents of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. \n\nThe term Nowruz in writing, first appeared in Persian records in the 2nd century AD, but it was also an important day during the time of the Achaemenids (c. 648-330 BC), where kings from different nations under the Persian empire used to bring gifts to the Emperor, also called King of Kings (Shahanshah), of Persia on Nowruz. The significance of Nowruz in the Achaemenid empire was such that the great Persian king Cambyses II's appointing as the king of Babylon was legitimized only after his participation in the New Year festival (Nowruz). \n\nThe UN's General Assembly in 2010 recognized the International Day of Nowruz, describing it a spring festival of Persian origin which has been celebrated for over 3,000 years.

Please, take carefully note of the following statement: \"This \"man\" is not \"Babylon the Great,\" who also fights against God, for she is a woman, a harlot.\"\n\nSo, for the Watchtower, the Man of Lawlessness has nothing to do with the harlot (Babylon the Great), because the man of lawlessness is a compound man, and Babylon the great is an impious woman, a harlot (all false religions of the world, according to the Watchtower). \nBut see now the incredible contradiction of the Watchtower in the following paragraph, in the same page:\n\n \"The man of lawlessness\" sets himself in opposition to God and is therefore a \"satan,\" which means \"resister.\" And, indeed, his \"presence is according to the operation of Satan.\" (2 Thessalonians 2 verse 9) In the days of the apostle Paul, there was \"mystery,\" or a religious secret, about the identity of this \"man of lawlessness.\" To this day mystery shrouds his identity in the minds of many persons, because his wickedness is practiced under the guise of godly devotion (2 Thessalonians 2 verse 7). By his lying teachings contrary to or superseding, as it were, the law of God, \"the man of lawlessness\" sets himself up over Jehovah God and other 'gods,' mighty ones of the earth, and also against God's holy ones, true spiritual brothers of Jesus Christ. (Compare 2 Peter 2 verses 10 to 13.) Since he is a hypocrite, a false teacher claiming to be Christian, he \"sits down in the temple of The God,\" that is, what such false teachers claim to be that temple.\u20142 Thessalonians 2 verse 4.\nIt is quite evident from this statement made by the Watchtower that this \"compound\" Man of lawlessness is an apostate religious movement that spreads false doctrines, so this means that this man automatically becomes part of the harlot (the world empire of false religions, according to the Watchtower), contradicting herself so clearly and forcefully.\n\nOn the other hand, the Watchtower, September 15, 2010, commenting on 2 Peter 3 and verse 4, the Watchtower says: \"The 'presence' of Christ, which began in 1914, has gone unnoticed for most people ... a clear \"manifestation of his presence\" will be the annihilation of the \"man of lawlessness\", that is, the clergy of Christendom (The harlot) (2 Thessalonians 2 verses 3 and 8).\n\nThen we ask ourselves: \u00bfDoes the clergy of Christendom is not part of the harlot?\u00bfHow, then, can the Man of lawlessness be part of the woman, who is a whore ... the mother of all harlots, if the Watchtower says that what distinguishes this man of lawlessness is precisely that he is a compound man and not a woman (the harlot)?", "title": "THE STRANGE AND CONTRADICTORY MAN OF LAWLESSNESS OF THE WATCHTOWER SOCIETY (JEHOVAH\u00b4'S WITNESSES)", "publishedDate": "2013-12-09T17:06:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "0sxZM2DTY6E", "description": "Sorry for my language...

El Episodio comenzaba en blanco y negro con una calidad deformada y un poco de estatica, pens\u00e9 que esta sucia y empolvada, estuve pensando limpiarla, pero no le di importancia y segui viendo el capitulo. Se ve a Rigby diciendo Mordecai esta es tu muerte, lo dice con una voz macabra y perturbador, Mordecai con cara de idiota dijo Que es la Muerte, tambi\u00e9n lo dice con una voz macabra, entonces Rigby dice La Muerte es esta, la pantalla muestra a Rigby con una pistola en la mano, pero que la serie esta prohibida las armas de fuego, pero segui viendo el capitulo, Mordecai dijo Rigby con una voz deformada, Rigby dijo una groser\u00eda que dice Muerete Hijo de Puta, Mordecai dijo No, la toma se pone negra y se escucha un balazo. La Imagen nos muestra el cad\u00e1ver de Mordecai sangrando de los ojos con un brazo herido y hecha de sangre, hab\u00eda sangre en la panza de Mordecai, tenia una pierna arrancada y se escucha una m\u00fasica perturbadora. Se corta la imagen con una pantalla en negro en 4 segundos y despues se ve a Benson, Papaleta y Skips llorando, pero no era un sonido de llanto, era un sonido de murmullos y gritos, la pantalla empieza a mover locamente, hab\u00eda una imagen de una ni\u00f1a ensangrentada con un cuchillo en la mano y unas palabras de sangre que dice \"Laughter is just Slaughter\".\n\nVolvio la imagen del episodio, se ve a Benson enojado que dice Rigby es tu culpa, con una voz mas perturbador, la pantalla se hace un enfoque a Rigby con cara de preocupado hace 10 segundos, despu\u00e9s Rigby empieza a gritar, pero el grito esta llenos de puros gritos, la pantalla se pone estatica y mucha estatica. Se pone la pantalla negra y despu\u00e9s se nos muestra la imagen de Mordecai  y Rigby muertos, el cuerpo de Rigby esta muerta, su estomago esta llenas de balazos, y sus ojos y su boca empienzan a sangrarse, lo extra\u00f1o es que la pierna de Mordecai no esta arrancada, se escucha mas murmullos que son mas perturbador, se ve otra vez la imagen de la ni\u00f1a, pero no tiene el cuchillo y abajo hab\u00eda un texto en sangre que dice \"You're Next\", y al final del programa sale Mordecai sin pupilas. Empiezan los cr\u00e9ditos pero estaban callado, despu\u00e9s sale el logo de Cartoon Network pero con un mal audio. El Capitulo era raro, sali\u00f3 al aire solo 1 vez, porque en las noticias dicen que muri\u00f3 4 personas al ver ese capitulo, pero no me paso nada a mi, y lo pregunte que era esta ni\u00f1a, no puedo distinguir quien es, pero alg\u00fan dia me olvidare de esa pesadilla.\n\nNota:\n-1: No dije la calidad se puso deforme. Y muchos Creepypastas dicen lo mismos.\n\n-2: muchas historias siempre tienen el mismo titulo.

This golden key to our genius and our connection is the Golden Ratio. \n\nAlso known as Phi, the Divine Proportion, the Golden Mean, it's Nature's perfect proportion for bringing parts together into a greater whole. It manifests as the ratio 1.618 to 1, in the golden rectangle, the golden spiral and star; in the ratio between the numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89...]\n\nThe Golden Ratio guides matter and the movement of energy in the Universe, from the golden spirals of galaxies, to hurricanes, ocean waves, flower petals and nautilus shells. It is the Pattern of Life.\n\nAtoms dancing in golden spirals, the geometry of our DNA; the proportions of our body; our golden spiral heartbeat; everywhere we find the Golden Ratio at play. It's the proportion of beauty, which can be enhanced in our face with the Golden Ratio eyebrow sculpting system developed by Anastasia of Beverly Hills. It's present in structures ancient and modern; that's [New York City's] Grand Central Station, lower left. \n\nGeniuses from Da Vinci to Einstein were fascinated by the Golden Ratio; it's present in the works of Steve Jobs and team Apple; the music of the Beatles, Mozart's symphonies and the greatest video of all time, Michael Jackson's Thriller. Plays a key role in The Da Vinci Code, Keifer Sutherland's new series Touch, and, in the current worldwide smash single, Gotye and Kimbra's Somebody That I Used To Know.\n\nEveryone carries a golden rectangle in their wallet; it's used in stock market forecasting in the Elliott Wave and in the millionaire's map abundance growth system; Twitter and many great web sites use it as a constant in their design; it's found throughout the world in great art; to take great pictures with a Da Vinci touch, download the free app Camera Awesome\u2014it's awesome!\n\nIt's Nature's Secret Nutrient for health and longevity. Peak performance is an outcome; that's me after winning a race a few weeks ago, using the Fibonacci-based training system.\n\nIt is a constant in our connection with one another, and with all life.\nI'll close with a quote from William Blake: To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wildflower, hold infinity in the palm of your hand, and eternity in an hour.\n\nEach of us holds an infinity of wisdom, compassion, and grace in the palms of our Golden Ratio hands. Now that you know the secret of this universal genius and connection activation factor, what gifts, what treasures will you discover and share to light the world, for one and all?\n\nThank you.\n*************\nFor more videos on the applications of the Golden Ratio, subscribe to my channel.\nPhotograph of TEDx speaker Matthew Cross by Diana Sonis:  \nhttp://www.DianaSonis.com", "title": "Golden Ratio Fibonacci Sequence TEDxEast: Matthew Cross", "publishedDate": "2012-12-08T21:03:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "0tAfFCJdd9c", "description": "new varna kuchek", "title": "varna kuchek", "publishedDate": "2010-01-11T15:59:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "0tBLTHI8Tdg", "description": "Contato para shows 78740999 ou 7 * 25850 fabinho\n953690304  Miney", "title": "Mc Veroki - Conto de Fada", "publishedDate": "2014-09-06T04:00:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "0tBTqgeMZ0s", "description": "Who is the REAL Jessica Alba?

Thus, the result is between lack and excess, but is neither this nor that. Virtue is a quality of good practice, other than addiction that is the practice of evil. Virtue is the middle ground, the mediocrity. Overeating, for example, is not virtuous but is not stop eating, but eating moderately is the middle ground.\nIt is therefore sufficiently clear that moral virtue is a middle ground, and in what sense are we to understand this expression? Half term is the balance between two vices, one of which involves excessive and the other, and this deficiency because its nature is directed to mediocrity in the passions and acts.\n\n\nWhat we have said it follows that it is not easy\nbe good, because in all things, is difficult to find\nthe medium term. For example, find a means of\ncircle is not for everyone, but only for that\nthat knows how to do it, and, likewise, any\nmay rage, give or spend money - it is\neasy, but do it to the person who should, as far,\non occasion, for the reason and the way they should,\nthis is what is not for anyone, nor easy.\nSo goodness is both rare and noble", "title": "ARISTOTELIAN VIRTUE", "publishedDate": "2012-08-06T17:13:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "0tOixAFh_BU", "description": "Join The Birthday Crew: http://bit.ly/SubDailyaulk\n\nVLOGMAS 19!\n\nThis is my most requested video \"how to log out of the new facebook messenger\" Because you guys wanted it so much i made this tutorial on how to log out of the new updated Facebook Messenger.
