As common in some Scarabaeidae, the males are larger than the females, reaching a length of about 60--130 millimetres (2.4--5.1 in). The males have specialised horns on the head and thorax that use to fight with each other to gain mating rights with females. The Atlas beetle differs from other Chalcosoma species (such as C. caucasus) in the end of the cephalic horn of the Atlas, which is broadened. The larva of the Atlas beetle is known for its fierce behavior, including biting if touched. Unverified reports exist of larvae that live together fighting to the death if there's not enough space or food.

Riders are arranged 2 across in 2 rows for a total of 32 riders per train.\n\nAfter the train leaves the station, it begins its ascent up the 230 feet (70 m) chain lift hill. Once reaching the top of the hill, the coaster drops 215 feet (66 m) at 74\u00b0 over the Rivertown midway. It then curves to the right up a 193 feet (59 m) hill and down the drop into the ravine, curving again to the left. The ride then ascends a 131 feet (40 m) camelback hill and drops, curiving left into the hammerhead turn. After dropping out of the hammerhead, the train travels up a 129 feet (39 m) hill (which has a trim brake). After the fourth hill, the train turns into down into a 287\u00b0 counter-clockwise helix (on ride photo is here) and into the mid-course brake run. After the short brake run the train drops down into the ravine, raising into a bunny hop hill, then into another bunny hop and into the final clockwise helix of 323\u00b0. After the final helix, the train passes over the Rivertown midway a second time and drops into the splashdown finale, slowing the train down and leading it into the final brake run. After braking, the train takes a left U-turn and heads back into the station.

These ambiguities can arise from the intentional use of phreakophonic, homographic, metonymic, or metaphorical language. A pun differs from a malapropism in that a malapropism uses an incorrect expression that alludes to another (usually correct) expression, but a pun uses a correct expression that alludes to another (sometimes correct but more often absurdly humorous) expression. Henri Bergson defined a pun as a sentence or utterance in which \"the same sentence appears to offer two independent meanings, but it is only an appearance; in reality there are two different sentences made up of different words, but claiming to be one and the same because both have the same sound\". Puns may be regarded as in-jokes or idiomatic constructions, given that their usage and meaning are entirely local to a particular language and its culture.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTags:\n\nleague of legends, puns, tons of puns, triforce, tons of damage, phreak, phreak pls, phreak stop it, phreak stahp it plz, NO, toxic, gay4hotshot", "title": "Phreak's terrible pun rejected by audience (Scrying Orb)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-05T10:25:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "0tudpZnZ5FM", "description": "enterobius en reproduccion", "title": "guerrero enterobius", "publishedDate": "2012-03-09T04:55:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "0tuhGIo1wzA", "description": "", "title": "Guardian Horse Bedding: Pellet Bedding, Day Two", "publishedDate": "2010-07-21T15:09:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "0tvJP4ckhlc", "description": "Mziuri Live", "title": "\u10d4\u10d9\u10dd & Vinda Folio - \u10e0\u10d0\u10ea \u10db\u10d0\u10db\u10d0\u10e1 \u10e3\u10dc\u10d3\u10d0", "publishedDate": "2014-06-15T23:32:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "0tvwqTfES3o", "description": "Join Herbie as he teaches you how to talk like a Corgi in six easy steps!

He said he felt disgusting towards the elder brother who took him to south Korea for a petty amount of money and seized his money. But he could not repress his bitter resentment at agents of the puppet Intelligence Service who manipulated such allurement and abduction operation, he added.\n    The participants in the round-table talks laid bare the sinister aims sought by the puppet group in such operations.\n    Kang Kyong Suk quoted a man who was in charge of her at the \"Joint Center for Interrogation of Defectors from the North\" in south Korea as saying: \"We are trying to increase the ranks of defectors from the north, even spending so much money in order to win back even a person of the north to our side in a bid to weaken the forces of the Workers' Party of the north and bring them to collapse and hoist our flag there.\"\n    Kim Kyong Ok also quoted a man who was questioning her as saying: \"We keep bringing people like you to the south not because money is in surplus. It is aimed to disturb the mindset of the north and spread liberal democracy to it\".\n    The speakers described south Korea as the worst tundra of human rights, adding that they were exposed to harsh persecution and disgrace. They condemned the south Korean puppet group for its moves to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK.\n    The south Korean puppet group is resorting to the smear campaign against the DPRK, trumpeting about the \"human rights record\" in the north, Kang Kyong Suk noted, and went on:\n    The group set up even a TV channel specializing in conducting an anti-DPRK smear campaign, letting \"defectors from the north\" appear in programs.\n    It went the lengths of bringing together those \"who were not defectors from the north\" and staging such burlesque as an art performance by a \"group of beautiful girls, defectors from the north,\" in the heart of Seoul as part of the smear campaign against the north.\n    Kim Kyong Ok noted that the puppet group is distributing money to wicked elements who fled to the south after committing crimes in the DPRK, before driving them to the anti-DPRK human rights campaign.\n    Ri Hyok Chol bitterly denounced a representative of the \"Federation of Movement for Free North Korea\" in south Korea for his sheer fabrication and groundless vituperation. This guy claimed in a television news briefing program that the people of north Korea were forced to weep along the route during the ceremony of bidding the last farewell to leader Kim Jong Il in December 2011 and otherwise they were threatened with arrest.\n    The participants in the round-table talks said they keenly realized once again that the DPRK is a large flower garden prevalent with humanity and it represents the genuine bosom of a mother. They pledged to turn over a new leaf and dedicate themselves to the drive for the prosperity of the country. -0-\n\n\nNorth Korea (DPRK - Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea)\nNordkorea (DVRK - Demokratische Volksrepublik Korea)\nCorea del Nord - Repubblica Democratica Popolare di Corea\nCorea del Norte\nCor\u00e9e du Nord\nKorea\u0144ska Republika Ludowo-Demokratyczna\n\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e-\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\nKuzey Kore\n\u0643\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629\n\uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d\n\u671d\u9bae\u6c11\u4e3b\u4e3b\u7fa9\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u570b", "title": "These 3 People defected from North Korea but returned!", "publishedDate": "2013-05-18T17:10:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uB5Sjs0GK8", "description": "Moskau-Wien-Paris - Out Now!\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/at/album/moskau-wien-paris-single/id677699811\nhttps://www.facebook.com/erwinundedwin\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/erwinundedwin\nhttp://www.erwinundedwin.at\n\nhttp://www.dreieck-records.com", "title": "Erwin & Edwin- Moskau", "publishedDate": "2013-08-08T23:07:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uBDgUDSqLY", "description": "Pratite Milana: +381 62 832 73 72 \nhttp://www.milantarot.com\nFB https://www.facebook.com/milantarotofficial\nFB https://www.facebook.com/milantarot4\nTW https://twitter.com/milan_tarot\nG+ https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MilanTarotPrivatno\nTumblr http://milantarot.tumblr.com/\nPinterest http://www.pinterest.com/milantarot/\nMyspace https://myspace.com/milantarotofficial\nNetlog http://sr.netlog.com/milantarot\nLinkedIN http://lnkd.in/wnKkGH\nInstagram http://instagram.com/milantarot#\nFoursquare https://foursquare.com/milan_tarot\nLivestream http://livestre.am/Lpn7", "title": "Milan Tarot - Kako da se spase FK Crvena Zvezda?", "publishedDate": "2014-06-09T15:36:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uBsqakHZ7w", "description": "i have entered bg with another 2 friends of mine on TeamSpeak and just before the bg was started we messed around a little and i recorded it.\n\ni play WoW-Israel server it has a small community with around 600 people online \nin evening but keeps on growing every day", "title": "World of Warcraft messing around #1", "publishedDate": "2011-04-03T12:46:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uC0U98kR_s", "description": "Tower Sessions Presents: Queso\n\nTower Sessions OSE (Off Season Episodes) feature additional performances and content that were not included in the season run.

The virus attacks the villi in the small intestines. Villi run along the inside of a mammal's small intestine and absorb nutrients. \n\nThe virus is found in the environment and can live dormant for years. The only product that kills Parvo is bleach. \n\nIt mainly affects puppies who are unvaccinated from the disease.\n - Which is why you should always vaccinate your dogs!!!\n\nSymptoms Include: Lethargy, depression, dehydration, vomiting, bloody/mucus-y diarrhea, and lack of appetite.\n\nThere is no definite 'cure' for Parvo yet. The symptoms are treated and antibiotics are given to avoid bacterial infections.\n\nFrom my own personal experience I saw multiple dogs that came into the veterinary office with Parvo and all that were treated survived. I'm not promising they will survive, but the chances are good if caught early and the proper treatment is given.\n\nThe treatment for Parvo is expensive, more expensive than vaccinations. If you are not vaccinating your dog because you do not have the money, please don't get a dog. Wait until you can afford it. \n\nIf you think your dog has the Canine Parvovirus call your veterinarian immediately!\n\nPLEASE DO NOT GO INTO THE OFFICE.

'Colours' is the first, breathtaking single taken from her upcoming artist album, and a promising one at that...\n\nHaving worked with EDM's producer elite, from Cosmic Gate to Dash Berlin, Chris Lake and Gareth Emery, Emma has been one of the fastest rising names in dance land. Her characteristic and versatile voice, ever warm and deep, has earned a place in the hearts of many. \n\nAnd it will in many, many more. With her debut album set for 2012 release, it's only a matter of time before the world discovers the songwriter, story-teller and voice that are yet to be fully revealed in Emma Hewitt. 'Colours' is the first of her rich palette of songs to come to life.\n\nAn enchanting, poignant track that s ends shivers down your spine, from the very first listen.\nWith her roots firmly grounded in dance music, it should come as no surprise that 'Colours' is accompanied by a set of high profile remixes.\n\nArmin van Buuren, a long-time admirer of Emma's voice, has been hammering his remix of 'Colours' for months, making sure it's an absolute floor killer. German producer Jerome Isma-Ae, one of the most-requested remixers around the globe, has sprinkled his energetic, prog-housy sound on top of 'Colours' as well.\n\nLyrics: \n\n\nIf you had this time again\nWould you do it all the same?\nI wonder, would I?\nOf the promises we made\nIs there anything you'd change?\nIn the re-runs of our lives...\n\nIf I could call you for a day just to hear the words you'd say\nI would...\n\nAll the colours that you bring\nAll come rushing back again\nAll the places that we've been this time\n\nAll the people that you knew\nThey'll come running back to you\nAll the faces that we've seen in this life...\n\nAnd we never took the time \nTo see where we were going\nWe were only passing by...\nAnd we never questioned why \nThe river keeps on flowing\nThe beauty of the ride...\n\nIf I could call you for a day just to hear the words you'd say\nI would...\n\nAll the colours that you bring\nAll come rushing back again\nAll the places that we've been this time\n\nAll the people that you knew\nThey'll come running back to you\nAll the faces that we've seen in this life...\n\nThe river flows...\n\nAll the colours that you bring\nWill they ever come again?\nAll the places that we've been this time\n\nAll the people that you knew\nThey'll be waiting there for you\nAll the faces that we've seen in this life...\n\nAll the colours that you bring\nAll we ever want to be\nAll the places that you've dreamed this time\n\nAll the people that you knew\nThey'll come running back to you\nAll the faces that we've seen in this life...\n\n\nVideo Directed by Elliot Sellers for The Masses (www.wearethemasses.com)\nProduced by Jack Richardson\n\n\n\"Colours\" (Album Version) Produced by Lee Groves\nMixed by David Bascombe", "title": "Emma Hewitt - Colours  (Armin van Buuren Remix) (Official Music Video)", "publishedDate": "2012-01-24T10:37:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uRUx40Lqbs", "description": "Phacelia d'Amour\nCSI AmB\nLe Mans - Boulerie Jump\nGP 125\n16/11/2014", "title": "Phacelia Le Mans GP125", "publishedDate": "2014-11-18T11:12:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uRheBiz13Y", "description": "EarthBound (SNES) Music - Battle Master Belch  Download all my Soundtracks as MP3 here http://www.nes-snes-sprites.com/", "title": "EarthBound (SNES) Music - Battle Master Belch", "publishedDate": "2012-05-08T17:39:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uS9BmJWX2U", "description": "Comedy Show", "title": "Screenland Crossroads", "publishedDate": "2013-03-09T02:42:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uSr7k7gAiw", "description": "WINNER chosen - Give-away CLOSED\n\nHere's my review of the A04's:\nhttp://www.totallydubbed.net/2012/05/04/review-of-the-redgiant-a04-incus/\n\nMy facebook page:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/TotallydubbedHD/164588276945555\n\nMy Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/TotallyDubbedHD/\n\nCONDITIONS:\nYou must pay for postage and packaging.\n\nThis is open WORLDWIDE, all you have to do is comment on this video or post on facebook or tweet me!

These three teams, themed around pirates, Vikings and knights, are distinct in classes and capabilities. \n\nThe objectives in a Pirates, Vikings and Knights II game is defined by the game mode that is being used; at the moment there are four game modes implemented out of a planned nine. In \"booty\" games, teams must collect or steal treasure chests distributed across the level and bring them back to their own base to activate a countdown timer to victory. The more chests a team has in its possession, the quicker the timer decreases. A variation on this is the \"booty tag\" mode, in which there is a single chest and the teams fight for control of the chest to decrease their timer. The third game mode is \"territory\", in which teams fight for control of a strategic area of their surroundings. When one team holds the territory, their countdown timer activates unless they are displaced by another team. The final game mode is a straight team deathmatch where the teams simply try to kill as many of the opposing teams as possible.\"\n\nJordan: http://www.youtube.com/user/captainsparklez\nChilled: http://www.youtube.com/user/criousgamers\nDiction: http://www.youtube.com/user/eatmydiction1\nMarc: http://www.youtube.com/user/juicetra\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/SeaNanners\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/SeaNannersPage\nTumblr: http://www.seananners.tumblr.com", "title": "I'M A PIRATE!

My favorite nursing pillow is the Brest Friend because it wraps all the way around you and supports your back, while also having a flat surface for the baby to stay a bit more secure.

Interrupciones con resultados interesantes y divertidos surgir\u00e1n en esta atm\u00f3sfera en la que tambi\u00e9n destaca la interpretaci\u00f3n monumental de un coro de tres integrantes.\n\nCabe mencionar que todos estos procesos musicales desembocan en la adaptaci\u00f3n a la obra para orquesta y m\u00e1quina de escribir de Leroy Anderson, en donde los asistentes podr\u00e1n disfrutar de un n\u00famero donde el acorde\u00f3n y la guitarra desaf\u00edan el acompa\u00f1amiento orquestal para dar pi\u00e9 al lucimiento de un instrumento poco com\u00fan: la m\u00e1quina de escribir. \n\nEl sorpresivo final de este espect\u00e1culo se da emulando una obra de John Cage donde algunos espectadores podr\u00e1n participar siendo int\u00e9rpretes en escena, fusionando esta obra monumental con una sorpresa musical muy contempor\u00e1nea. Todo esto es posible en un show donde la t\u00e9cnica del clown irrumpe en la m\u00fasica culta.\n\nCreaci\u00f3n colectiva de Ensamble-r\u00edas sobre una idea original de Roam Le\u00f3n y Mauricio Dur\u00e1n\n\nDirecci\u00f3n esc\u00e9nica.

After giving birth, a female koala carries her baby in her pouch for about six months. When the infant emerges, it rides on its mother's back or clings to her belly, accompanying her everywhere until it is about a year old. Koalas live in eastern Australia, where the eucalyptus trees they love are most plentiful. In fact, they rarely leave these trees, and their sharp claws and opposable digits easily keep them aloft. During the day they doze, tucked into forks or nooks in the trees, sleeping for up to 18 hours. \n\nMore info: http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/koala/\n\nor http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala", "title": "Koala (Phascolarctos Cinereus)", "publishedDate": "2010-02-16T19:48:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uuQ-vkrmDA", "description": "Hijab Tutorial Square Scarf / Paris Segiempat - Natasha Farani #40\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/YTsubsNatashaFarani\n\nAssalamu'Alaikum..\nTutorial Hijab kali ini, Scarf from All's Scarf.

This constitutes a 'fair use' of any such copyrighted material as provided for in Title 17 U.S.C. section 107 of the US Copyright Law.\n\nIn Revelation 14:6-7, the first angel\u2019s message reads: \n\nAnd I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice,  Fear God (keep His commandments), and give glory to him (reflect His character); for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters (Exodus 20:3-11)! \n\nThis is a call to humanity to return to the true worship of the Creator.  Flee worldliness (1 John 2:15-16), put your faith in Christ, His Beloved Son in Whom He is well pleased, and through the Holy Spirit, keep His holy and eternal ten commandments, which reflect His love and character (Exodus 20; Revelation 14:12 and 1 John 5:3).   It is our duty to keep the holy and eternal ten commandments of God (Ecclesiastes 12:13). \n\nIf we break any of God\u2019s holy and eternal ten commandments, we sin yet Christ says \u201cgo and sin no more\u201d (John 8:11).  Therefore, through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we must observe the law of God if we are to be His since His law governs New Jerusalem where no sin is found (Micah 4:1-3; Revelation 14:12 and Revelation 22:14).  Keep the holy and eternal ten commandments of God now in anticipation of what to expect in heaven where His law rules.  His holy and eternal ten commandments, spoken by the Word Who became flesh in the New Testament \u2013 Jesus Christ \u2013 are found in Exodus 20:3-17.\n\n1 John 2:3:4 - And hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\n\nThankfully, by the grace of God, the holy, pure and sinless blood of the Lamb of God takes away our sins upon repentance (1 John 1:9).  So by faith in the Son of God and through the power of the Holy Spirit, let\u2019s follow Christ\u2019s instruction: go and sin no more! \n\nFor more information on Christian beliefs and prophecy, please visit  theseventhdayremnantchurch.org, remnantofgod.org, john1429.org as well as cregen124 and NicholasPoGM's YouTube channels.\n\nMay the Most High and Source of eternal life bless you in your walk with His Son, Jesus or Yeshua the Christ!", "title": "Ten commandments of God in the New Testament", "publishedDate": "2014-10-26T04:30:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uyNwdDsnjo", "description": "http://AmharicTube.com Tagel Seifu - Enrotalen Gena [Poem for Meles Zenawi]", "title": "Tagel Seifu - Enrotalen Gena [Poem for Meles Zenawi]", "publishedDate": "2012-08-29T05:15:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uylbk0-vik", "description": "Please subscribe and share", "title": "The Disbeliever \u1d34\u1d30 | KUFR |  By Abu Aaya Rayan Arab", "publishedDate": "2012-09-11T16:33:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uz2zFAc84g", "description": "the first part of the video shows the first will O the wisp i caught on my camera.....remember the cameras are triggered by motion....this is the entire video all... 31 secs.....next is a video ....yes its slanted....to show what bugs look like on the video....then we get several vids of the latest will O the wisps....the last is just to show what it looked like after they left....you can watch the time stamps to get and idea of the time it took place.....my belief is 'anything IS possible'...whats yours??", "title": "will O the wisp...are they real?", "publishedDate": "2014-06-07T01:33:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uzU8gTATZM", "description": "Humphrey before and1.", "title": "John Humphrey \"Helicopter\" NCAA DC 03", "publishedDate": "2006-02-18T02:52:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uzbmCWGHF8", "description": "2000: A new detective becomes Detective Bunk Moreland's partner in Homicide.", "title": "The Wire Prequels - When Bunk Met McNulty (2000)", "publishedDate": "2009-01-16T05:16:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uzcqWpbgq0", "description": "Get those medical secrets: http://www.health101.pw/Medical-Secrets.shtml\n\nThis video shows you how to say or pronounce Homeostatic.\n\nAudio is from cancer.gov.", "title": "How to Say or Pronounce Homeostatic", "publishedDate": "2013-08-10T14:43:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "0uzpVYfUOcw", "description": "Touro Shorthorn com s\u00eamen dispon\u00edvel na Semeia - Select Sires.", "title": "Shorthorn: Capiche", "publishedDate": "2009-11-16T21:34:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "0v-BYrtDYmA", "description": "Music by:\nChill Carrier - A New Day", "title": "TRIA GALLERY - Camomile Hixon", "publishedDate": "2013-09-15T02:02:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "0v-Ccyci48M", "description": "Tune in Sundays 11am/10c\n\nIn her book, 'Start Where You Are: A Guide to Compassionate Living,' Tibetan Buddhist nun Pema Chodron writes: \"We already have everything we need.

Per fortuna per\u00f2, in questi ultimi anni, un gruppo di interpreti e di editori ci hanno permesso di scoprire l'incredibile ricchezza di un'opera s\u00ec eclettica, ma anche affascinante. In particolare, la musica per pianoforte di Reynaldo Hahn, ancora poco conosciuta, rappresenta infatti una delle sfaccettature pi\u00f9 originali del suo talento. Le eccezionali registrazioni presentate in questi quattro dischi dovrebbero contribuire a scongiurare anche i pregiudizi pi\u00f9 tenaci. Incluso nel cofanetto, il documentario in DVD che permetter\u00e0 all'appassionato curioso di esplorare pi\u00f9 nel dettaglio il mondo del pianoforte di Reynaldo Hahn.\n\nPROGRAMMA DELL'INCISIONE: \nTempo totale CD: 256'31\"\nTempo totale DVD: 56'32\"\n\nCD 1\nLe Rossignol \u00e9perdu, po\u00e8mes (1899 - 1910)\nI.

I don't want you to worry about this. I made this very same mistake when I started my juicing journey. Juicing takes practice and no one becomes a pro overnight. Now let's get to the problem so I can show you the solution.\n\nWhen it comes to juicing for weight-loss, there is indeed a right way and a wrong way. When your main objective is fat-loss, you want to avoid sugar-containing fruits and vegetables. Yes, there are high-sugar veggies, such as beets and carrots. Why is this bad? The simple answer: because extra sugar gets stored as fat.\n\nHere's a little science on fat storage and sugar consumption for you:\n\nSugar consumption causes a spike in blood sugar levels inside the body\nYour pancreas secretes insulin as a response\nThe insulin pulls the sugar (which is now glucose) out of your blood and takes it to your cells\nYour body can only handle a certain amount of glucose\nOnce the limit is reached, any excess is stored as body fat\nAs higher insulin levels are needed, your body creates an inflammation response\nThis hinders other body functions, like fat burning (this means stalled weight loss or even weight gain)\nSo to some it all up...Too much sugar = too much insulin = body fat storage\n\nHere's another reason why juicing is stalling your weight loss.\n\nFor this answer, you must first understand a little science behind hormones and your metabolism.\n\nTwo hormones play a huge role in hunger, fat storage and metabolism. Those are ghrelin and leptin. Both hormones respond to how well-fed you are.\n\nGhrelin tells the body that it is hungry.\nLeptin tells the brain that the body has had enough to eat, producing a feeling of satiety.\nOur bodies are stubborn. They do not like change; it's a survival thing. When we diet, our bodies rebel by revving up our appetite hormones. When we consistently take in less energy, our bodies respond by making us hungrier and decreasing our metabolic (burn) rate.\n\nAnyone who has dieted knows that it is difficult to lose weight when you are hungry and when your metabolism isn't burning efficiently. Unfortunately, many people diet too hard and then succumb to their hunger pangs (often times bingeing or yo-yo-dieting).\n\nWhat is the best way to prevent this?

For two years, they devoted their days to constructing their dream studio and spent their nights performing songs by The Police, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones at local pubs to pay the bills. \"We really got down and dirty with dry walling and literally laying the floorboards, and at the same time we were taking a couple of days a week to focus on writing songs,\" recalls Keith Jeffery, Atlas Genius's vocalist/guitarist. \"We had a lot of song ideas and it was important to us to have our own studio where we could experiment and hone in on our sound,\" adds brother and drummer, Michael Jeffery. The studio was designed and outfitted by the brothers with the help of their father (who comes from a music and engineering background). Once the studio was complete, the first song that Atlas Genius finished was a song called \"Trojans,\" which they wrote, recorded and produced in collaboration with their friend, keyboardist Darren Sell. After many weeks tweaking the song, Michael insisted that the song was ready to be heard outside of the studio walls. Within an hour, \"Trojans\" was on the Triple J Unearthed Website, SoundCloud, and for sale via TuneCore on iTunes, Amazon and Spotify worldwide.\n\n\"We had begun to think that music was a pipedream and we had all gone back to university to pursue more realistic careers,\" says Keith. \"We'd had such a long slog of playing late nights and working all day, and it felt like we didn't really have anything to show for it.\" But then, in the midst of cramming for their Fall 2011 semester final exams, Neon Gold discovered \"Trojans\" on the Triple J Unearthed Website and wrote a post praising \"Trojans\" as a song sure to \"invade your head, all dressed up in a clever disguise of earnest vocals riding a hooky riff.\" Checking the band's email account for the first time in over a month, the band found that dozens of record labels, publishers, lawyers, booking agents and management companies from all over the world had contacted them.\n\n\"We were trying to focus on school, but it was just impossible,\" recalls Keith. \"So we said, 'There's something going on here. Let's get back to the music.'\" The band added manager, Jonny Kaps from +1, to their extended family to navigate all of the interest as the band focused on writing and recording more songs.\n\nQuickly named an iTunes Single of the Week in Australia and New Zealand, \"Trojans\" reached #4 on Hype Machine by the end of May. In August, SiriusXM Satellite Radio's Alt-Nation discovered the song on a blog and decided to give it some spins. There was an immediate reaction from listeners, and in September, \"Trojans\" was placed into heavy rotation, where it maintained a top-five position on the listener-generated Alt-18 countdown and peaked at number one for 4 consecutive weeks in January 2012. \"Trojans\" began selling over a thousand tracks per week on U.S. iTunes and soon climbed to 45,000 sales - all with zero promotional efforts from the still-unsigned Atlas Genius.\n\nThe band's first release from their new label home, the EP Through The Glass (produced, engineered and mixed by the band), came out in June of 2012. With Through The Glass completed, Atlas Genius then holed up in its studio and worked on writing and recording its first full-length album, while at the same time rehearsing for their first ever tour. The tour started in August 2012 and led to three more tours back to back taking them thru to the end of the year. Thus, their full-length debut was finished up between tour dates and got completed just before Christmas 2012. When It Was Now is set for a US release on February 19th, 2013, with an international release to follow soon after.", "title": "Atlas Genius - Centred On You [Official Audio]", "publishedDate": "2013-02-12T16:54:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "0vac_7yuYEQ", "description": "\u261e Did you enjoy this video?

This unique partnership focuses research on public-private-nonprofit collaboration, placing emphasis on collective choice processes and public service delivery. Research on collaborative governance also opens up opportunities for public management scholars to collaborate with those from other social science fields and disciples.\n\nWhat is the relationship between an inter-organizational network's internal dynamics and its capacity to adapt, bounce back, or survive in response to diminished financial resources? Understanding how to manage network resiliency to endogenous change or exogenous shocks remains a relatively under-studied problem in studies of networks involving governmental, non-governmental, and for-profit organizations.  Because the public sector is often expected to coordinate resilient networks in response to predicted and unexpected natural, man-made, and economic collapses, the lack of research is a problem.  The little research that does exist tends to emphasize a network's evolution and flexibility to adapt, however, research has not yet fully addressed whether and how different network processes influence network resiliency.\n\nThis paper provides the theoretical rationale by reviewing the literature on change in public networks. The paper builds upon and extends recent research examining different logics of network coordination among multisectoral networks of government, nonprofit, and for-profit organizations and presents the methodology and cases used in the analysis. The paper also examines how differences in network coordination among three networks were related to the self-organizing processes of network resiliency between eras of resource munificence and austerity.  In the final section, the paper discusses the implications of the findings and the limitations of the study, highlighting how the paper contributes to both research and practice by clarifying and categorizing the relationship between three network self-organizing coordination processes and a network's resilient capacity to adapt, bounce back, or cope. \n\nJoaqui\u0301n Herranz, Jr., joined the Evans School faculty in 2004. His research interests include multi-sectoral multi-organizational network performance and management, strategic management of public and nonprofit agencies, social enterprise, as well as the roles of art, culture, and creativity in community and regional development.\n\nHerranz's research includes studies for The Urban Institute, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, World Bank, and the International Labour Organization. His published scholarship includes peer-reviewed articles in the Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, Public Performance and Management Review, International Public Management Journal, Public Management Review, and the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly.\n\nHe is currently writing a book about quadruple bottom line organizational performance in which he adds cultural creativity as the fourth bottom line to the triple bottom lines of financial, social, and environmental performance.\n\nHerranz holds a Ph.D. in urban political economy and policy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and a Master of City Planning from the University of California, Berkeley. He also holds an AB in urban political economy from Occidental College.", "title": "Highlights: The ABCs of Self-Reinforcing Processes in Network Resiliency", "publishedDate": "2014-03-04T23:44:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "0vbSL8j0zx0", "description": "Silent Hill 4: The Room OST - Into The Depths Of Self Discovery", "title": "Silent Hill 4: The Room OST - Into The Depths Of Self Discovery", "publishedDate": "2010-02-16T11:53:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "0vbStOvfVGg", "description": "Elettroforo\n\nSi carica un piatto ricoperto di resina strofinandolo con una pelliccia.

It is located in the Atlantic Ocean north of Cuba, Hispaniola  (Dominican Republic and Haiti) and the Caribbean Sea, northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands, and southeast of the United States of America (nearest to the state of Florida). Its total land area is almost 14 000 km\u00b2, with an estimated population of 330,000. Its capital is Nassau.\n\nOriginally inhabited by Arawakan Taino people, The Bahamas were the site of Columbus' first landfall in the New World in 1492. Although the Spanish never colonised The Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans (as the Bahamian Taino settlers referred to themselves) to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 to 1650, when British colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera.\n\nThe Bahamas became a crown colony in 1718 when the British clamped down on piracy. Following the American War of Independence, thousands of pro-British loyalists and enslaved Africans moved to The Bahamas and set up a plantation economy. The slave trade was abolished in the British Empire in 1807 and many Africans liberated from slave ships by the Royal Navy were settled in The Bahamas during the 19th century. Slavery itself was abolished in 1834 and the descendants of enslaved and liberated African form the bulk of The Bahamas's population today.\n\nEconomic activity is mostly based on tourism and financial services. A relatively high degree of economic freedom has made The Bahamas one of the most prosperous countries in the Caribbean region. The financial sectors domestic and offshore activities contribute around 15 percent of GDP. The economy has a very competitive tax regime. The government derives its revenue from import tariffs, license fees, property and stamp taxes, but there is no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, value-added tax (VAT), or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits. In the most recent year, overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 21.8 per cent.\n\nThe Bahamas has the 47th freest economy in the world according to the Heritage Foundation 2010 Index of Economic Freedom. The Bahamas is ranked 7th out of 29 countries in the South and Central America/Caribbean region, and its overall score is higher than the regional and world averages. Total government spending, including consumption and transfer payments, is relatively low. In the most recent year, government spending equaled 23.4 percent of GDP. Authorities are committed to improving the transparency of budget planning. Annual FDI into The Bahamas is $700 million a year. The Bahamian legal system is based on British common law.\n( source Wikipedia )", "title": "The Bahamas", "publishedDate": "2010-03-14T17:11:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "0vlMJUEX6K0", "description": "VIDEOS RELACIONADOS CON ESTE TEMA  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWi_4AYJf2W6rEuVZ4So96g81DkMmQvW2\n\nVisita mi web  www.reparatumismo.org  autor: Carlos L\u00f3pez.", "title": "COMO DESATASCAR EL TAMBOR DE UNA LAVADORA DE CARGA SUPERIOR - LAVARROPAS", "publishedDate": "2013-05-23T10:01:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "0vldHYrLDmc", "description": "Sons of Anarchy 7x12 Promo \"Red Rose\"\nSons of Anarchy 7x12 Promo\nSons of Anarchy Season 7 Episode 12 Promo\nSons of Anarchy S07E12 Preview\nSons of Anarchy 7x12 Preview", "title": "Sons of Anarchy S07E12 Preview \"Red Rose\"", "publishedDate": "2014-11-19T07:49:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "0vlmap95uP4", "description": "My new workspace.

One vegetable and one cheese is the classic combination, but that's by no means mandatory. Use your imagination- olives, salsa, tofu, anything!\n\nStep 2: Beat eggs & add salt & pepper\nCrack your eggs into the mixing bowl and use the fork to beat them until the whites and yolks are well-blended. Add a pinch of coarse salt and a pinch of black pepper.\n\nTip\nIf you want your omelet extra-fluffy, add a tablespoon of water to the mix too.\n\nStep 3: Heat skillet\nPlace the skillet on your stovetop and turn the burner to medium. Allow it to heat up.\n\nStep 4: Add oil or butter\nAdd one tbsp olive oil or unsalted butter, and swirl it around the skillet until the entire cooking surface is coated.\n\nStep 5: Add fillings to skillet, then remove\nAdd all your fillings, except for cheeses, to the skillet. Allow them to sizzle just for a bit, then remove them from the skillet and set them aside for a moment.\n\nStep 6: Pour in egg mixture\nPour the egg mixture into the skillet, swirling it around until it is spread evenly.\n\nStep 7: Swirl plan\nWhen the edges of the omelet are solidifying, swirl the pan again to redistribute the uncooked eggs in the center.\n\nStep 8: Add fillings & turn down heat\nWhen the edges are turning crisp and pulling away from the skillet, add your fillings and cheese down the center of the omelet so it's separated into thirds, and turn the heat down.\n\nStep 9: Let cheese melt & flip\nAllow the cheese to melt. Once it has done so, use the spatula to flip each outside third of the omelet over the middle third.\n\nStep 10: Slide onto plate\nSlide the omelet out of the skillet onto the plate. It's ready to enjoy.\n\nDid You Know?\nThe largest omelet on record was made in 2002 in Ontario, Canada, and weighed 6,510 pounds.", "title": "How to Make an Omelet", "publishedDate": "2010-07-30T20:00:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wA428TVxsI", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "MORRISTOWN CHEER HALFTIME 9/27", "publishedDate": "2014-09-27T21:12:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wA9B-BqRfE", "description": "A look at the clock in the Thornton's Arcade in Leeds on Tuesday 2nd September 2014.\n\nThe Ivanhoe Clock, at one end of Thornton's Arcade, was built in 1877 by William Potts and Sons of Leeds.  Robin Hood, Richard the Lion-Hearted, Friar Tuck and Gurth the Swineherd, all characters in the 19th century novel Ivanhoe by Sir Walter Scott, feature on the clock.  Each character, in turn, marks the quarter hour by striking a large bell with his fists. The life-sized figures were sculpted by Leeds artist John Wormald Appleyard.  The 5 bells were provided by John Taylor of Loughborough.\n\nThere was clearly a problem with the clock on this day as it did not play the full westminster quarter chime but only the first four notes.\n\nThe following are links to videos of other clocks I have visited:\n\nLONDON BIG BEN\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7b8lF3R7w\n\nLUTON TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pe1v45i7NE\n\nAMPTHILL TOWN CLOCK\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNLUW_t7a-c\n\nTROWBRIDGE TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reYZ0y1ZzUc\n\nHEREFORD MARKET HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlBmfDemduE\n\nCARTERS GREEN CLOCK TOWER\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6plAPnhGbPA\n\nTETTENHALL CLOCK TOWER\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJyGL44F6Xk\n\nKIDSGROVE VICTORIA HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eGA1TJJhCM\n\nCREWE TOWN CLOCK\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3UQBhXepVE\n\nCREWE MARKET HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6irgbC4h6c\n\nMANCHESTER TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORn8fXYjOZM\n\nECCLES TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozO5613Tk7k\n\nHYDE TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udIeuVQmYG8\n\nDUKINFIELD TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmVmhsBeXFA\n\nSTALYBRIDGE CIVIC HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_cOzzpVphA\n\nROYTON TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE3_9oK0CDE\n\nROCHDALE TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ9uFkbAewY\n\nBOLTON TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siJV8IsX8vs\n\nCHORLEY TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV3XhBDpzPM\n\nDARWEN TOWN AND MARKET HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPSMoh98wPA\n\nGREAT HARWOOD MERCER MEMORIAL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rn9oasubQY\n\nBURNLEY TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t93wBGI5hqQ\n\nCOLNE TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYIFrZn3bcg\n\nLANCASTER TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pgMtYQg7Lw\n\nKENDAL TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QBC48LkQ2E\n\nEARLESTOWN TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2pHOzOpzHk\n\nLIVERPOOL MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdpO3Ddeib0\n\nLIVERPOOL VICTORIA BUILDING\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JBfno-l7iw\n\nBIRKENHEAD TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsSmZFVio9s\n\nSOUTHPORT TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXEULIyA4Us\n\nBUXTON TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mlmh2dWQvn4\n\nBUXTON DEVONSHIRE DOME\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DniJcUlWEDA\n\nMARSDEN MECHANICS HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll0qABeYwU0\n\nLINDLEY CLOCK TOWER\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJAfMp85MuE\n\nHALIFAX TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssFHU0REPaE\n\nBRADFORD CITY HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfY3y9AH4g4\n\nCLECKHEATON TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muECZnIDp7M\n\nDEWSBURY TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh_K51Tqdp4\n\nBATLEY LIBRARY AND ART GALLERY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDWQpRIWgTE\n\nMORLEY TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsb3zcA2Yig\n\nLEEDS TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2V8AqmMP2w\n\nLEEDS GRAND ARCADE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3tIT_69i4k\n\nILKLEY TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR_F5Wsqb6E\n\nHULL GUILDHALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15WIR59M5I4\n\nGRANGE-OVER-SANDS CLOCK TOWER\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-SP85OONFk\n\nULVERSTON TOWN CLOCK\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pImukhUSEG8\n\nDALTON-IN-FURNESS TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOOuYWs61m4\n\nBARROW-IN-FURNESS TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V4Vy0MjWO0\n\nSOUTH SHIELDS TOWN HALL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0ZotYNuFNA", "title": "Leeds Thornton's Arcade Clock", "publishedDate": "2014-09-02T19:24:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wAIKy8GvYQ", "description": "Prosecutor Ryan Brackley addresses the court in the second trial of Fred Mueller on Oct. 1, 2013.

IF YOU ARE EASILY OFFENDED, OR ARE A MINOR, PLEASE DO NOT WATCH!!!\n\nThis is a fan made video - The Knightime Project has no affiliation with The Lonely Island or SNL.\n\nIf you haven't seen the original song by The Lonely Island(!!!), watch it here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI6CfKcMhjY\n\nThis version \u00a9 The Knightime Project 2011 All music reprogrammed by The Knightime Project\n\nSpecial thanks to http://www.youtube.com/user/Snellevleermuis for agreeing to accept my video response to his brilliantly constructed lyrics video -- check it out here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z09JBgX-AEg\n\nWell, I think it's fair to say that this song is going to be The Lonely Islands most successful release to date -- they only uploaded the video a month ago and it's already been viewed 25m times!  Well done to The Dudes, and especially Michael Bolton for being such a star!\n\nI made the decision to post a couple of version of the track -- one as it appears on the album, the other without the gunshot FX -- just in case you want to make a parody that doesn't feature guns!\n\nIn terms of production this has been the trickiest instrumental to work on, especially getting the snare rolls right (the ones leading into the chorus), and the main sound for the chorus itself.\n\nI ended up using 12 musical layers for the chorus, the 'standouts' being the Roland D50 'Pizzagogo' sound, and the use of double transposed strings to bring out the 'squeaky' sound!  A video tutorial will explain more methinks!\n\nAlso, when I came to put the video together, I had the problem of where to put Michael Bolton's lyrics as a lot of the time he sings over the boys.  They also say things under the parts Michael sings, so I made the decision to put those parts at the bottom of the screen, and also to colour code them for easier recognition.  I hope this helps!\n\nI'd once again like to thank you all for your support -- without it I wouldn't be remaking these tracks!  I read all your comments and try to reply to messages personally, but please don't take any offense if I don't get back to you -- it's a time thing for me (I virtually have non!).\n\nI'm now going to start work on some video tutorials so you can see how I deconstructed/reconstructed these tracks.  I'm also going to start working on another track from the album; I wonder which one it'll be... :)!\n\nB", "title": "Jack Sparrow Instrumental (feat.

And he was given a salary by the Comune of Florence in virtue of his talent and excellence.\"[1]\n\nThe late-16th century biographer Giorgio Vasari says of him: \"[H]e made a decisive break with the crude traditional Byzantine style, and brought to life the great art of painting as we know it today, introducing the technique of drawing accurately from life, which had been neglected for more than two hundred years.\"[2]\n\nGiotto's masterwork is the decoration of the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua, commonly called the Arena Chapel, completed around 1305. This fresco cycle depicts the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ. It is regarded as one of the supreme masterpieces of the Early Renaissance.[3] That Giotto painted the Arena Chapel and that he was chosen by the Comune of Florence in 1334 to design the new campanile (bell tower) of the Florence Cathedral are among the few certainties of his biography. Almost every other aspect of it is subject to controversy: his birthdate, his birthplace, his appearance, his apprenticeship, the order in which he created his works, whether or not he painted the famous frescoes at Assisi, and his burial place.", "title": "Giotto di Bondone", "publishedDate": "2010-11-13T18:15:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wFVNWh6bh4", "description": "This is it folks, after this I'm moving on, so long primitivists it's been a great time but I need to address better topics in the youtube world haha", "title": "Last Words About Primitivism", "publishedDate": "2009-07-05T19:06:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wF_3GDYstw", "description": "Visit http://www.hardwarecanucks.com for more news and reviews\n\nOur Forums: http://bit.ly/cjkiSP\n\nFollow us on\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hardwarecanucks\nFaceBook: http://facebook.com/hardwarecanucks\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/hardwarecanucks\n\nOur Folding team: http://bit.ly/12vbFnY", "title": "Sennheiser URBANITE Headphones and Momentum M2-IEG", "publishedDate": "2014-09-09T13:00:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wFdQZKlc64", "description": "Tavuklu Sultan Kebab\u0131 Tarifi\nhttp://www.nefisyemektarifleri.com/tavuklu-sultan-kebabi-tarifi/\nDi\u011fer videolu tariflerimiz i\u00e7in: http://www.nefisyemektarifleri.com/video/\n\nNefis Yemek Tariflerini takip etmek i\u00e7in;\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/NefisYT\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/NefisYT\nGoogle Plus: http://gplus.to/NefisYT\n\nTELEFONDAN G\u0130RENLER \u0130\u00c7\u0130N;\nTavuklu Sultan Kebab\u0131 Tarifi\nMalzemeler\n2 adet yufka\n400g tavuk g\u00f6\u011fs\u00fc\n400g tavuk pirzola\n1 adet kuru so\u011fan\n2 yemek ka\u015f\u0131\u011f\u0131 domates sal\u00e7as\u0131 (1 ka\u015f\u0131\u011f\u0131n\u0131 ket\u00e7ap kullanabilirsiniz)\n1 su barda\u011f\u0131 ha\u015flanm\u0131\u015f ya da konserve bezelye\n1 adet patl\u0131can\nPulbiber\nKekik\nKarabiber\nTuz\nBe\u015famel sos i\u00e7in:\n1,5 yemek ka\u015f\u0131\u011f\u0131 un\n1,5 su barda\u011f\u0131 s\u00fct\n2 yemek ka\u015f\u0131\u011f\u0131 tereya\u011f\u0131\nTuz\n\u00dczeri i\u00e7in:\nKa\u015far peyniri rendesi\nHaz\u0131rlan\u0131\u015f\u0131 Patl\u0131can\u0131 alacal\u0131 soyarak k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck do\u011fray\u0131n ve s\u0131v\u0131 ya\u011f ile k\u0131zart\u0131n.

Bis in das 17. Jahrhundert verstand man n\u00e4mlich darunter den Odermennig. Da beide Pflanzen, Wasserdost und Odermennig bitter schmecken, wurde dieser Name wahrscheinlich von dem Odermennig auch auf den Wasserdost \u00fcbertragen. Wegen der hanf\u00e4hnlichen Bl\u00e4tter wird der Wasserdost auch Wasserhanf genannt. Wasserdost ist in Mitteleuropa die einzige Art einer Gattung, die mehrere hundert, fast ausschlie\u00dflich in Amerika vorkommende Arten einschlie\u00dft.\n\nWasserdost besiedelt bei uns feuchte Untergr\u00fcnde in Waldlichtungen, an Gr\u00e4ben und an Ufern. Meist findet man den Wasserdost in gro\u00dfen Best\u00e4nden. Mit Ausnahme von Ziegen verschm\u00e4hen fast alle Tiere seine bitteren Bl\u00e4tter. Die Wurzeln und die Bl\u00e4tter wurden fr\u00fcher bei Leber- und Gallenleiden, sowie als Abf\u00fchr- und Blutreinigungsmittel verwendet. Die wirksamen Pflanzenorgane des Wasserdosts sollten m\u00f6glichst in frischem Zustand verwendet werden, da die g\u00fcnstigen heilwirksamen Eigenschaften dieser Pflanzen beim Trocknen verloren gehen. Auch ist die Dosierung bei Anwendungen mit dem Wasserdost genau einzuhalten, da die Pflanze sonst einen kr\u00e4ftigen Brechreiz erzeugen kann.\n\nJe nach Standort wird der ausdauernde Wasserdost 60 bis 150 cm hoch. Die aufrecht stehenden, bebl\u00e4tterten und behaarten St\u00e4ngel des Wasserdosts sind r\u00f6tlich gef\u00e4rbt. Die handf\u00f6rmigen, gegenst\u00e4ndig angeordneten Bl\u00e4tter  sind 3 bis 7schnittig und kurz gestielt. Die Blattr\u00e4nder sind ges\u00e4gt. Die Bl\u00fctezeit des Wasserdosts erstreckt sich von Juli bis September. Die hellrot bis purpurn gef\u00e4rbten Bl\u00fcten des Wasserdosts bilden mit ihren kleinen  dichte Scheindolden. Der Wurzelstock dieser Heilpflanzen ist verzweigt, die Wurzeln sind hellgrau, schief und faserig. Der Geruch der Wurzeln eines Wasserdosts ist widerlich, der Geschmack ist bitter.\nStandort / Hier findet man den Wasserdost\n\nDer Wasserdost w\u00e4chst fast im gesamten europ\u00e4ischen Raum. Die Pflanze bevorzugt feuchte Standorte, besonders auf Waldlichtungen ist der Wasserdost oftmals zu finden. \nWirkung der Heilpflanze / Heilwirkung - Wasserdost\n\nabf\u00fchrend, appetitanregend, blutreinigend, gallentreibend, stimulierend, wundheilend\nIn der Naturheilkunde verwendete Pflanzenteile\n\nIn der Naturheilkunde benutzt man von dem Wasserdost die vor der Bl\u00fcte gesammelten Bl\u00e4tter und die im Fr\u00fchling oder Herbst gesammelten Wurzeln. Gesammelte Wurzeln werden gewaschen, in Scheiben und dann z\u00fcgig getrocknet. \nAnwendung mit der Heilkraft dieser Pflanze\n\nWichtige Inhaltsstoffe dieser Heilpflanze sind: Gerbstoff, Harz, \u00e4therisches \u00d6l, Inulin, Eisen\n\nDer Wasserdost wird in der Pflanzenheilkunde innerlich und \u00e4u\u00dferlich angewendet. Anwendungen mit dem Wasserdost in der Naturheilkunde finden Sie unter folgenden Stichworten:\n\nCholesterin, Couperose, Gallenblase, Rekonvaleszenz, Sch\u00fcrfwunden, Verletzung, Verstopfung, Wunde\nBitte beachten Sie auch diesen Hinweis\n\nObwohl die Anwendungen mit Heilkr\u00e4utern oft eine positive Wirkung auf Beschwerden haben, sollte man vor der Heilpflanzenanwendung immer R\u00fccksprache mit einem Arzt halten. Dies gilt nat\u00fcrlich auch f\u00fcr Anwendungen mit dem Wasserdost.\n\nHinweis zu den Gesundheitsthemen !\n\nEine zu hohe Dosierung des Wasserdosts ist zu vermeiden, da die Pflanze sonst Brechreiz erzeugen kann.", "title": "Wasserdost, Kunigundenkraut, Wasserhanf, Korbbl\u00fctler (Asteraceae)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-02T22:59:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wJme16_C4o", "description": "Longtime friends Denzel Washington and Lenny Kravitz tell Dave about their boating trip off the coast of Italy.", "title": "Denzel Washington & Lenny Kravitz Tell David Letterman About Their Boat Trip", "publishedDate": "2014-09-23T23:07:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wK1127fHQ4", "description": "In this video, Dr. Joe Bresee, with CDC's Influenza Division, describes the symptoms of swine flu and warning signs to look for that indicate the need for urgent medical attention.\n\nComments on this video are allowed in accordance with our comment policy: http://www.cdc.gov/SocialMedia/Tools/CommentPolicy.html\n\nThis video can also be viewed at http://www.cdc.gov/cdctv/", "title": "Symptoms of H1N1 (Swine Flu)", "publishedDate": "2009-04-29T02:30:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wKb7aXpXV4", "description": "At the Cameron park zoo", "title": "Elephant painting", "publishedDate": "2012-11-03T23:12:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wKotIoMOl0", "description": "Nauru, officially the Republic of Nauru and formerly known as Pleasant Island, is an island country in Micronesia in the South Pacific.

Click below.\nhttp://www.curepilonidalcyst.com\n\nPilonidal Sinus, also known as tailbone abscess, is a capsule containing bacteria (pus) below the skin, in other words, enfleshed, in the natal cleft and its nearby part of the buttocks. The capsule is formed by bacteria to create an environment in which they can survive inside the human body. A tailbone abscess spreads, turning into a chain of various abscesses (like a carbuncle but non-contagious).\n\nA study done by Drs. Brook, Rodriguez, Contrioni and Anderson, among various organizations, where pus was aspirated from pilonidal sinuses in 25 children found in it Bacteroides sp, Coccus, Fusobacterium sp, Clostridium sp, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, and Proteus sp. On the other hand, many believe the only bacteria in pilonidal sinus are Staphylococcus, when these weren't even found in the study (this doesn't mean they can't be present in some cases, though.)\n\nA tailbone abscess can't turn into cancer. So, don't let anyone trick you if you have one.\n\nWhat is The Conventional Treatment for Pilonidal Sinus?\n\nThere're 2 conventional treatments for pilonidal sinus, both of them equally ineffective:\n\nDrainage: The tailbone abscess is cut open to drain its pus. Since the abscess is huge, it's impossible to get out all its pus using this procedure, so it'll soon reproduce. A cyst-drainage is typically done at the emergency room of any hospital. The procedure it minimally invasive and there's no downtime.\n\nPilonidal Surgery: The pilonidal sinus is cut off along with part of the buttocks, sometimes with all of them. A huge wound is left which is almost guaranteed to become infected, which results in another pilonidal sinus. There're 3 types of pilonidal surgeries, the only difference is how the wound is treated: Closed-Wound Surgery, Open-Wound Surgery and Cleft-Lift Surgery. All of them have approximately 50% success rate the first time, 40% the second time, and 10% the third time on (of course, surgeons will lie to get your money). Though, even if the procedure is successful, the scar left by it can tear with tension (any effort made) and become infected. Pilonidal surgery is extremely intrusive, since the flesh that's cut off doesn't grow back and there's often a long downtime.\n\nSurgery isn't even an option. The above procedures have been around for hundreds of years. So, it isn't likely that conventional medicine will develop a reliable solution for pilonidal cyst.\n\nAn Alternative Treatment for Pilonidal Sinus\n\nHomeopathy is a healing system that stimulates the immune system through microdoses of substances that cause symptoms similar to those of a disease to eventually cure it, definitely. Homeopathy is acknowledged as being able to cure difficult diseases. A study published in 2010 on the International Journal of Oncology revealed that Homeopathy can completely destroy cancerigenous cells without damaging healthy cells as chemotherapy does. Turning back to pilonidal sinus, Homeopathy can cure it.\n\nUnfortunately, it's hard to find a competent Homeopathy practitioner. Most can only cure diseases that are considered difficult but are no big deal within Homeopathy. The system is employed differently by each practitioner.\n\nIn the case of a tailbone abscess, most Homeopathy practitioners will only be able to make the abscess almost go away, but rarely cure it.", "title": "What Is A Pilonidal Sinus And What Is The Treatment For It", "publishedDate": "2012-01-29T04:08:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wPk3klxrvo", "description": "watch Dr. Windisch get a flu shot\nor\nlearn how to give an intramuscular injection", "title": "IM injections done on dr. windisch", "publishedDate": "2010-10-07T22:12:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wPzooaLXZA", "description": "This video was uploaded from an Android phone.", "title": "Fuse Fireworks at clumber park", "publishedDate": "2011-08-22T12:02:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wQ73Thy_YE", "description": "W210 E55 Coolant temperature in hot wether.", "title": "W210 E55 Coolant temperature in hot wether.", "publishedDate": "2014-08-05T18:20:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wQG7KDD6_I", "description": "Georgia Child Endangerment Laws after a GA DUI arrest. Does child endangerment affect my license?\n\nGeorgia DUI laws allow a prosecutor to add an additional DUI for every underage child in the case, if the driver is found to be DUI. A Georgia DUI child endangerment offense, added to a DUI conviction, is deadly serious. But, a child endangerment charge adds both punishment and loss of license as consequences of a DUI. This rule applies to both driving under the influence of alcohol or DUI-drugs if a child age 14 or younger occupies the same vehicle.  \n\nAs part of Georgia\u2019s DUI law, a provision has been added making it a separate charge of child endangerment if a driver is intoxicated while transporting a minor. If you are charged with child endangerment, you will face very harsh penalties.  Georgia DUI laws provide that a driver who is arrested for DUI, and has a minor child 14 years of age OR under in that vehicle, will usually face another charge of child endangerment --- for EACH child in that motor vehicle. The crime of child endangerment is an independent offense which cannot be \"absorbed\" by the underlying driving under the influence offense.\n\nBy example, three children in the car would make the driver face 4 DUI charges. With child endangerment charges, you could be have these serious charges added to a child custody battle in divorce actions.\n\nIf you are convicted of child endangerment, you will face up to a year in jail. This jail time can be added to jail time applied for the DUI charge. A third offense is a felony with a minimum fine of $10,000 and up to five years in prison.\n\nA child endangerment conviction cannot be combined with DUI in Georgia. Both offenses are treated separately with regards to license suspension. This increases your chance of becoming a habitual violator. If you are convicted of a DUI and two counts of child endangerment during the same arrest, you will be treated as a habitual violator even if it is for one incident. At this point, you license is suspended for five years.\n\nIn GA, when a child 14 or under is a passenger in a car driven by a person arrested for DUI, the police officer can add another criminal charge for child endangerment. For each underage child in the car, another DUI can be brought against the driver. this can create serious driver's license issues for the arrested DUI driver.\n\nChris Ambrose is the regional affiliate for TEAMDUI in the southwest corner of the State of Georgia.

The Raman shift was settled at 2849 cm-1, which corresponds to CH2 stretching vibration. This contrast provides high sensitivity for lipids that are abundant in the different layers of the skin.\nA maximal projection of the skin is shown. At the skin surface, long filaments corresponding to the hairs can be seen. The signal is very strong because hairs are cover with oil. On the external sides of each hair filament, black parts corresponding to a shadow effect are observed. The image gives details on hair filament. For example compartments containing the chromospheres are seen. At the skin surface, a bright polygonal pattern outlines the corneocytes forming the top layer of the skin, the corneum. The signal arises from the intercellular space rich in lipids, cholesterol and ceramids.

But then, most of us just ignore moderately high blood glucose levels. Some of the common symptoms that come with type 1 diabetes include-\n\n    large volumes of urine\n    urinating at a greater frequency\n    undue hunger and thirst\n    rapid weight loss\n\nIf you are experiencing any of the aforementioned symptoms then it indicates that you are prone to diabetes. Hence, make sure to contact your doctor at the earliest.\n\nHowever, those with type 2 diabetes may not experience any of these symptoms. Instead, they may complain of-\n\n    difficulty in wound healing\n    irritation\n    tiredness\n    Prone to infection\n    lack of concentration at workplace\n    intense itching\n\nHowever, some type 2 diabetes may also complain of\n\n    frequent urination\n    undue thirst\n\nNow the question is \"Is It Possible For Diabetes To Cure Itself?\". Well, though diabetes cannot be treated completely, yet you can definitely keep it under control. Even diabetes patients can lead a healthy life, the only thing that matters is that they need to keep their blood sugar level under control. In other words, you can restore to a normal life span if your blood sugar levels are under control.\n\nThere are times when diabetics may not be in need of any insulin or tablet so as to keep their blood sugar levels under normal range. This span is referred to as the honeymoon phase (type 1 diabetes). However, the time span of this phase may vary from a couple of days to a couple of months. Some people often misinterpret this phase and think that they have overcome diabetes. Diabetics run at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The condition is more serious in female diabetes patients. Having diabetes for a prolonged period of time may lead to passive heart attack and can be fatal as well.\n\nremedy for diabetic\ntreatment for dm\nremedies for diabetics\nmedicine for diabetic\nmedicine for diabetes\ntreatment in diabetes\ncures of diabetes\ndiabetic\ndiabetic is curable\ndiabetes remedies\ncures for diabetes\nwhat are the cures for diabetes\ntreatments of diabetes\ntreatments to diabetes\nremedies diabetes\ndiabetes the symptoms\nmedication for diabetic\ndiabetes and cure\ncure of diabetes\ntreatments diabetes\ntreatment diabetes", "title": "Common Things About Diabetes - Is it Possible For Diabetes to Cure Itself?", "publishedDate": "2013-05-15T03:06:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wW_THEq20w", "description": "Senator Hayes is enjoying a fine breakfast of Quaker Puffed cereal. A young boy, who works in the Senate dining room, tries to convince the southern Senator to try the RICH MAN cereal, which has cereal bits in the shape of dollar signs. The Senator is an atypical southern Senator, because he is disgusted by cereal that is in the shape of dollar signs, and prefers the natural taste of Quaker Puffed Wheat, or Quaker Puffed Rice cereals. \n\nHow quaint the 1959 commercial is. In reality, the super-fat southern Senator would be gobbling down dozens of bowls of the RICH MAN cereal (dollar sign cereal.) More than likely, the 2013 version of the cereal might have a name change. It is more than likely that the cereal would be called MITT ROMNEY cereal.\n\nFor more vintage pop culture, from the 1950's, 1960's & the 1970's, you might enjoy visiting TV TOY MEMORIES http://www.tvtoymemories.com/FRONT_PAGE.html", "title": "VINTAGE 1959 ANIMATED QUAKER PUFFED WHEAT & PUFFED RICE CEREAL - SOUTHERN SENATOR ENJOYING CEREAL", "publishedDate": "2013-05-04T19:39:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wYKgVj6L-s", "description": "Check out the greatest Indian film of all time.

It likewise strengthens the physical body's own natural defense against free radicals before they can induce any damage. By mass, Criollo cacao features much more antioxidants compared to red wine, blueberries, acai, pomegranates, and goji berries COMBINED. The sheer amount of antioxidants makes these amazing anti aging superfoods for seniors.\n\nCacao is even associated with romance, because of phenylethylamine (PEA), which is a chemical that is produced within our bodies whenever we fall in love. This particular effect is potentiated by the presence of the endorphin Anandamide, likewise referred to as the \"happiness chemical\", giving a natural euphoric feeling. Enzyme inhibitors for Anandamide is also present in cacao, slowing down the body's capacity to breakdown the endorphin - making the natural \"high\" go on for a longer period.\n\nAside from the already impressive health benefits of Cacao, it is also one of the most nutritionally wealthy superfood - it is a remarkably rich source of theobromine, manganese, zinc, copper, magnesium, omega-6 fatty acids, PEA, trytophan, serotonin, and more. The amazing nutritional value, in addition to the anti-oxidant content of cacao makes it one of the perfect anti aging supplements in the world.\n\nDespite the truth that Cacao is exceptionally nutritious, it is unexpectedly non-fattening. The fats in cocoa butter are healthy fats, and Cacao contains oleic acid - a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat (also found in olive oil) that may improve good cholesterol. In addition, substances found in cacao are understood to help decrease appetite. This makes it a good option for those serious in weight loss.\n\nMACA\n\nTraditionally an ancient Peruvian super food, in its natural state Maca is a root vegetable coming from the cruciferous family of plants that is typically dried and then powdered. It is highly regarded, not merely for its dietary value, but for its extensive medicinal and health benefits. It is also called Peruvian Ginseng.\n\nMACA ROOT FOR WOMEN\n\nMaca powder raw organic is known for a multitude of features, stemming from the reality that it increases the endocrine system's capacity to work efficiently. Since hormones (which are the products of the endocrine system) regulate most of the body's natural function, Maca has a significant impact on fertility, energy, vitality and libido. Problems with hormonal imbalance will oftentimes lead to problems with reproductive health.\n\nMACA ROOT FOR MEN\n\nThe maca root powder is regarded as one of the best Superfoods for its exceptional capability to combat fatigue and improve strength and energy. It has also been regarded as a highly effective Adaptogen. This makes Maca one of the best supplements for men wanting to create muscle mass, as well as increase athletic performance.\n\nTHE MACA MAGIC OF NUTRITION\n\nMaca root is furthermore a powerhouse in terms of nourishment, rich in calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur and iron. It also contains trace minerals including zinc, iodine, copper, selenium, bismuth, manganese, tin, silicon, vitamin B1, B2 and B3, plus a large amount of protein (9 out of the 10 essential amino acids) - making it a great way to get the important minerals and vitamins without all the extra calories.\n\nWith the amazing health benefits of these two superfoods, regular consumption is a great way to stay healthy and is a great supplement for the serious health enthusiast.\n\nLike and Subscribe for the latest health topics, tips and recipes!\n\nLike us on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/PureNaturalMiracles", "title": "Cacao Nibs - Dr. Mercola talks about the remarkable health benefits of these delicious treats", "publishedDate": "2014-02-18T06:15:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wnORiCbHw8", "description": "This is a deck profile of the Yugioh TCG Exclusive archetype U.A.\nGaming Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD-uyhXC1IXHO_myehlXEIg\n\nPlease subscribe to my channel so I could quit my job and become a full-time Duelist.

As a result, the carbon fiber furniture has gained an almost stereotypical futuristic image.\nFor this collection, we wanted to explore new possibilities for expression by using carbon fiber in a supporting role to emphasize and accentuate the main material, rather than as the star in its own right. We arrived at this idea after thinking about carbon fiber's use as a supporting building material, a technique developed after the Hanshin Earthquake of 1995. Wrapped around pillars or bridge girders, carbon fiber cladding can provide additional seismic resistance for civil engineering works that would be difficult to reinforce against earthquakes through traditional methods.\nCarbon fiber bends when used on its own, but when used to 'sandwich' weaker materials like cardboard and polystyrene, the other material's compressed strength works to suppress its pliancy, creating a strong, light composite material. Adhering the carbon fibers to the surface like tape or a sticker achieves the strength necessary for furniture.\nThis new method of making overturns both the traditional composition of internal structure and external cladding and the basic manufacturing process in which the structure is first formed then finished common to both architecture and furniture, ultimately reorganizing the relationship between structural form and surface material.", "title": "visible structures designed by nendo", "publishedDate": "2011-08-28T11:59:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wpBuKe1jCk", "description": "Heather Ellis, a student at the University of Dundee, talks about the Lovelace Colloquium and her own project.", "title": "Heather Ellis on Lovelace Colloquium", "publishedDate": "2014-05-14T11:24:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wpC7da1dJc", "description": "Si te ha gustado el v\u00eddeo, suscr\u00edbete a nuestro canal: http://www.youtube.com/user/antena3?sub_confirmation=1\nUna de las imitaciones m\u00e1s esperadas de la gala 8 por ser la primera vez que se canta rumano en el plat\u00f3 de Tu cara me suena Mini ha sido la imitaci\u00f3n de Fran y Miki Nadal del grupo O-zone y su \u2018Dragostea din tei\u2019. \u00a1Lo han hecho genial!\n\nCANALES SUGERIDOS: \n- http://www.youtube.com/atrestube\n- http://www.youtube.com/toptrendingvideo\n- http://www.youtube.com/topstylevideo", "title": "Miki Nadal y Fran imitan a O-zone en Tu cara me suena Mini", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T22:21:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "0wpLhNr935M", "description": "twikle tw.inkle little star..

Frank Sinatra, um velho amigo de seu pai e com quem trabalhava, era seu padrinho.\n\nApesar de ter crescido em Los Angeles, ela \u00e9 pouco conhecida nos Estados Unidos, mas teve um sucesso comercial interessante em outros pa\u00edses do mundo, mais notavelmente na Austr\u00e1lia, It\u00e1lia e Alemanha.\nA carreira come\u00e7ou aos cinco anos, cantando ao lado de Don Ho no Hava\u00ed, para um especial de Natal produzido por seu pai. Boa parte da inf\u00e2ncia, Nikka passou no est\u00fadio de grava\u00e7\u00e3o de Don Costa, convivendo com artistas como Quincy Jones e Sammy Davis Jr. Aos sete anos, cantou a m\u00fasica \"On My Own\" em um show na It\u00e1lia, e o sucesso da apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o foi t\u00e3o grande que acabou gerando seu primeiro disco. O trabalho, hom\u00f4nimo, foi lan\u00e7ado em 1981 e vendeu dois milh\u00f5es de c\u00f3pias no mundo todo, apesar de n\u00e3o ter sa\u00eddo nos Estados Unidos. Depois de lan\u00e7ar seu segundo disco, Fairy Tales (1983), Nikka Costa passou seis anos sem gravar, devido \u00e0 morte de seu pai no mesmo ano. A cantora voltou ao mundo da m\u00fasica com o disco Here I Am (1989), lan\u00e7ado discretamente por uma pequena gravadora alem\u00e3. No mesmo ano, assinou contrato com a gravadora Mushroom Records e lan\u00e7ou Butterfly Rocket, que rendeu uma indica\u00e7\u00e3o a Melhor Artista Revela\u00e7\u00e3o no Australian Recording Industry Awards.", "title": "Nikka Costa - I believe in love", "publishedDate": "2010-03-27T16:45:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "0x2Ss068x78", "description": "Falealili uma medley.", "title": "Samoan Dance ADS", "publishedDate": "2013-03-10T23:01:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "0x2wHTujsk4", "description": "vid\u00e9o clip de la chanson Quand je mange du Jello en bonhomme allumette !", "title": "Quand je mange du Jello de Patrick Groulx", "publishedDate": "2009-09-17T23:55:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "0x3UJmaQrW0", "description": "Fox News, july 15, 2008.", "title": "Vincent Bugliosi Interview Re: Atkins Compassionate Release - FoxNews", "publishedDate": "2009-01-12T18:43:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "0x3ZieON1BA", "description": "Music video by Asking Alexandria performing Someone Somewhere.

But sometimes gift cards are seen like you weren't creative or thoughtful. Check out these tips for turning your gift card wrapping from blah to beautiful.\n\nGift cards are great for last-minute presents, especially if the recipient is hard to shop for. But sometimes gift cards are seen like you weren't creative or thoughtful. You know: \"Blah.\" \n\nI'm Gina Miller for CreditCards.com and if this sounds like you, listen up. I've got some tips on creative ways to wrap gift cards. No more blah!  \n\nThe key? Once you pick a gift card, choose a theme that goes with the type of card you're giving. Ready to get inspired? Let's go!\n\nYour local craft store is a great place to start. There you'll find inexpensive items that add flair to the gift card. \n\nSo here's an idea for a female who loves jewelry.   At the craft store I found a decorative box on sale that can later be used to store jewelry, plus the box is a great place to hide her gift card. I attached the card on the lid with some tape, then placed it in a simple gift bag with some colorful ribbon.  \n\nNow, maybe you have a friend taking a beach vacation. Here I purchased a gift card that can be used anywhere. I then attached it to a small packable beach basket. I included some sun protection and lotion products then decorated it with ribbons. This makes a great bon voyage gift!  \n\nFor my male friend I chose a gift card to his favorite TV and electronics store. Since I know most guys never like to be too far from the TV remote, I searched for a box with a movie theme that will keep his remotes in place. Then I added some fancy cigars, and placed the gift card between the cigars. I also tried to keep this gift as masculine as possible, by using a neutral color gift bag to hold all the goodies and still add some creativity.  \n\nWhen I buy gift cards for children and teens, I always attach a toy, a book or some art supplies since kids and teens like gifts they can enjoy on the spot.    \n\nSo think about the person you are gifting, plan a theme for the gift card, and have some fun. With a little creative packaging, you can turn gift cards from \"blah\" to \"wow!\"\n\nI'm Gina Miller, for CreditCards.com.", "title": "Gift cards: How to wrap plastic with pizzaz", "publishedDate": "2013-11-05T22:23:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "0xISlwR8_AA", "description": "Dominic \"Dom\" Chavez, candidate for Austin City Council and other Place 5 candidates state their positions on single-member districts.", "title": "Dom Chavez Supports Single Member Districts", "publishedDate": "2012-04-17T06:12:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "0xIxi95yDKk", "description": "Extra footage of the mile-high pizza toss.

Walter Burkert suggests that unlike the Judeo-Christian use of demon in a strictly malignant sense, \"[a] general belief in spirits is not expressed by the term daimon until the 5th century when a doctor asserts that neurotic women and girls can be driven to suicide by imaginary apparitions, 'evil daimones'. How far this is an expression of widespread popular superstition is not easy to judge... On the basis of Hesiod's myth, however, what did gain currency was for great and powerful figures to be honoured after death as a daimon...\"\u2009[2] Daimon is not so much type of quasi-divine being, according to Burkert, but rather a non-personified \"peculiar mode\" of their activity.\n\nIn Hesiod's Theogony, Pha\u00ebton becomes an incorporeal daimon,[3] but, for example, the ills released by Pandora are deadly gods, keres, not daimones.[2] From Hesiod also, the people of the Golden Age were transformed into daimones by the will of Zeus, to benevolently serve mortals as their guardian spirits; \"good beings who dispense riches...[nevertheless], they remain invisible, known only by their acts\".[4] The daimon of venerated heroes, were localized by the construction of shrines, so as not to restlessly wander, and were believed to confer protection and good fortune on those offering their respects.\n\nCharacterizations of the daemon as a dangerous, if not evil, lesser spirit were developed by Plato and his pupil Xenocrates,[2][dubious -- discuss] and later absorbed in Christian patristic writings along with Neo-Platonic elements.\n\nIn the Old Testament, evil spirits appear in the book of Judges and in Kings. In the Greek translation of the Septuagint, made for the Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria, the Greek \u00e1ngelos (\u03ac\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2: \"messenger\") translates the Hebrew word mal'ak, while daimon (or neuter daimonion) carries the meaning of a natural spirit that is less than divine (see supernatural) and translates the Hebrew words for idols, foreign gods, certain beasts, and natural evils.[5] The usage of daimon in the New Testament's original Greek text, caused the Greek word to be applied to the Judeo-Christian concept of an evil spirit by the early 2nd century AD.", "title": "Daemon shot dead", "publishedDate": "2013-01-18T12:06:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "0xb-it0DNNA", "description": "CP Chinato-CD Ciconia Negra: 2-2 (Pretemporada, 20/08/2014)", "title": "CP Chinato-CD Ciconia Negra: 2-2 (Pretemporada, 20/08/2014)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-31T01:17:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "0xbfsRJSohY", "description": "Canci\u00f3n extra\u00edda del disco de Kike Su\u00e1rez & La Desbandada \"Carta Blanca\" (DFX2010)", "title": "Kike Su\u00e1rez \"La Chari\" (video-clip)", "publishedDate": "2007-06-14T21:48:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "0xc123itvpM", "description": "Saksikan Rising Star Indonesia \nSetiap Hari Kamis dan Jumat \nPukul 21.00 WIB hanya di RCTI\n\n------------------------------\u00ad----------\u00ad-------\nDownload Application Rising Star Indonesia :\n\nGoogle Play Store : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.screenz.risingstar_in\n\nApp Store : https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/rising-star-indonesia/id904309041?mt=8#\n\nSubscribe now for more Rising Star Indonesia videos: http://www.youtube.com/RisingStarIndonesia\n\nVisit Official Site of Rising Star Indonesia:\nhttp://www.risingstarindonesia.com\n\nLike Rising Star Indonesia on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RisingStarIndonesia\n\nFollow Rising Star Indonesia on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/RisingStar_INA\n\nFollow Rising Star Indonesia on Instagram:\nhttp://instagram.com/risingstar_ina", "title": "CND \"Best Day Of My Life\u201d American Authors - Rising Star Indonesia Best 14 Eps 15", "publishedDate": "2014-10-17T18:02:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "0xcDWzp_76s", "description": "The National Anthem of the Republic of Uzbekistan (Uzbek: Ozbekiston Respublikasining Davlat Madhiyasi) came into being when Uzbekistan  was a republic  of the Soviet Union.
