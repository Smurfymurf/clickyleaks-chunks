At the beginning, of course these differences will put them into an exciting affair. Pisces is a water sign. In astrology that means that Pisces is deeply feeling and intensely romantic, and loves the whole fantasy of love and sex. Pisceans make fabulous lovers because they can enter into anything that their partner can imagine in a way that can fulfill the fantasy of the sex partner. \n\nSagittarius of course is gripped by this because Sagittarius loves passion, especially Sagittarius loves an energetic approach. So, sexually they are both passionate and energetic. The difficulty is that Sagittarius doesn't want to be tied down and Pisces does. Pisces wants someone strong in his or her life that will be a partner and a lover, and someone to take care of him or her. \n\nMany times, it isn't just financially, it's emotionally. The Piscean needs to have that communion, a feeling of being in a long-lasting and deeply feeling communion. This is exactly what Sagittarius may flee from because Sagittarius doesn't like having demands. \n\nSo, in very short order, the Sagittarian nature, which is to escape, and the Piscean nature, which is to enter more deeply into a relationship find that they are completely at odds. They might work well as business partners because Pisces can set up the creativity, can come up with the ideas and the imagination and the fertile brain of a Piscean. Sagittarius, of course is filled with ideas, so together they can create beautifully. \n\nAs lovers, sex is very innovative. As long-term, loving partners they have very little in common.", "title": "Are Sagittarius & Pisces Compatible? | Zodiac Love Guide", "publishedDate": "2013-03-07T22:22:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "4db1t9_t1wA", "description": "This video was done as a request from Janet Carswell for her son Chris and for her extended family.

The fact that the implant is intra- muscular means that once it is in, it can not be removed or reversed. Disulfiram works in the following way.\n\nIf alcohol is consumed when disulfiram is present acetaldehyde levels are increased 8 to 10 times that of those present during normal alcohol consumption. Within 5 to 10 minutes of consuming alcohol the effects of a severe hangover will be experienced. These effects will continue for as long as there is alcohol present in the body, with the symptoms being proportional to the amount of alcohol ingested. This is called the alcohol-disulfiram reaction.\n\nFor more in-depth info visit www.alcoholaction.org", "title": "Alcoholism Treatment", "publishedDate": "2012-06-25T06:35:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dguVDFiZgc", "description": "Sacramento Republic FC makes history by becoming the first USL PRO franchise to form partnerships with two MLS clubs - San Jose Earthquakes and Portland Timbers.", "title": "Sacramento Republic FC - Affiliation Announcement", "publishedDate": "2014-01-29T00:07:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dh34aa_0Ng", "description": "The Super Hero of ANTI-OXIDANT. Dr. OZ said that GLUTATHIONE is the most powerful Anti-Oxidant that you never even heard before. But for many Filipinos, they surely heard of it as a whitening product. Dr David Katz joined Dr Oz and said that unlike other antioxidants, Glutathione is made in your body.  Another reason that Glutathione is the most important Antioxidant is because it is the one that your body relies on to defend yourself against toxins. \n\nHOW IT WORKS?\nDr Oz did a demonstration to explain how Glutathione works.  In your body you have Glutathione and you have normal cells and toxic cells. Toxic cells are your own cells that have been damaged from free radicals, or they can be cells from outside of your body that got inside.  The Glutathione removes the toxic cells.  If you do not have enough Glutathione, then the toxic cells do not get removed from your body and you do not heal yourself.  Your body can only help you recover if you help your body to do it.\n\nDr Oz: How Do You Know If You Have Enough Glutathione?\n\nDr Oz asked Dr Katz how we can tell if we have enough Glutathione.  Katz said that if you have a chronic disease like Diabetes or Cancer, you probably have low levels of Glutathione and should have your Glutathione levels checked.  If you are chronically fatigued, low levels of Glutathione could be both the cause and effect of this as well.  Dr David Katz said that when you give people Glutathione, amazing things can happen.  One of his patients has Parkinsons Disease and gets Glutathione injected into his vein weekly, and it has helped to stabilize his condition.  The Glutathione has not made the Parkinsons go away, but it also has not gotten any worse which is a big deal!\n\nDr Oz: How To Increase Glutathione Levels\n\nDr Oz said that the following are The Building Blocks of Glutathione and by doing all of them, you can increase the Glutathione Levels in your body:\n\nMaxgxl is a patented product released to the public on February 1st 2007 after undergoing 12 revisions in composition.  It is the brainchild of Dr. Robert Keller who holds 3 American Board Specialties in Internal medicine.  These medical specialties include Oncology, Immunology and Hematology.  This product was originally formulated to help the immune system of the patients in Dr. Keller's medical clinic which include AIDS patients, chronic hepatitis C patients, chronic fatigue patients, fibromyalgia patients and those suffering from chronic viral illnesses.  Maxgxl has all of the necessary amino acids which will allow our own body to manufacture increased levels of Glutathione and restore vitality to all of our cells and organ systems.  \n\nMaxgxl works in our bodies to help us rebuild our cellular levels of Glutathione.  Glutathione is a protein which is present in every living cell of our body.  As our level of Glutathione diminishes our cells are no longer in optimum health and diseases start to attack our bodies.   Unfortunately we lose about 1% per year of our Glutathione level beginning at age 20 years.  By the time we are 50 years of age we have lost 30% and this loss is accelerated by illnesses, sleep deprivation, alcohol, and cigarette smoking.  Glutathione is our body's number one most potent antioxidant.   It enhances our immune system response and also helps us detoxify from the toxins we ingest in the foods we eat, the water we drink and in the air that we breathe.  \n\nMaxgxl comes in packages of 3 capsules.  The usual dosage for healthy persons is to take 1 package in the early am and the second package in the early pm between 1:00pm and 4:00pm.  It may be taken with or without food and for those who experience \"heartburn\" from Maxgxl they should always take it immediately after food.   As a general rule the sicker one is the higher the dose of Maxgxl is required but the slower one should go in reaching the optimal amount of the product.  For instance a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis or AIDS who has taken a lot of medication may eventually need 2 packages up to 3 times daily but they might even start with just 1 capsule per day and slowly increase the dosage.  Some people will experience skin rashes, congestion and increased pain as they start to detoxify however this is a sign that the product is working and rather than stopping the Maxgxl one should simply start with a lower amount and gradually increase up to a maximum of 2 packages (6 capsules) three times per day.  Some persons have experienced a \"sudden high\" or euphoria immediately after taking Maxgxl.  This is simply a conclusive sign of how badly they need the product as their glutathione level has suddenly been increased giving them a sudden feeling of enhanced wellbeing and alertness.\n\nCongratulations on your decision to make a positive difference in your health by starting to work on improving your cellular health and in so doing making all organ systems of your body work to their maximum efficiency.\n\nContact: Jen Yco 09228802898", "title": "Dr OZ Glutathione", "publishedDate": "2012-08-09T05:51:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dhNkBu5rV0", "description": "I.

So thankful to Scott for his AMAZING artwork. If you want to check out more by him, see his info below. Also this video was inspired by an excerpt from my book coming out Oct 7! Also just to be explicit, this video's basic premise is that God created all things good so we can worship Him in those things. BUT the point is that the things themselves aren't evil, but our distortion of them is. So for example sex is amazing, but adultery, porn, and outside the marriage context sex isn't. So this video isn't a license to take things how you want them, but it's an invitation to not miss God in all that he created.  \n\n8 x 10 digital print of painting! - http://ow.ly/o9v8i\n\nMY INFO\nFacebook: http://ow.ly/bMEPU\nTwitter: http://ow.ly/bMEQd\nInstagram: http://ow.ly/nkV7K\nSite: http://ow.ly/bMERM\nEmail: jeffersonbethke@gmail.com\n\nVIDEOGRAPHER INFO:\nFacebook: http://ow.ly/ctFhh\nTwitter: http://ow.ly/ctFeS\nInstagram: http://ow.ly/nkVkY\nSite: http://ow.ly/ctFea \nEmail: matthew@cikproductions.com\n\nAUDIO PRODUCER INFO:\nFacebook: http://ow.ly/dr57o\nTwitter: http://ow.ly/dr57N\nEmail: soundbreaker.musik@gmail.com\n\nSCOTT ERICKSON'S INFO\nFacebook: http://www.fb.com/scottthepainter\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/scottthepainter\nWebsite: http://scottericksonart.com\n\nGet my audibook FREE here: http://www.jeffbethke.com/audible", "title": "Why Some Christians Are Actually Thieves | Jefferson Bethke", "publishedDate": "2013-08-22T04:15:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dresc1WN9c", "description": "", "title": "funny Mendicant", "publishedDate": "2014-04-07T12:15:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "4drsXOXL89M", "description": "", "title": "Recrystallization of Aspirin : Amazing Crystal formation", "publishedDate": "2010-02-16T15:18:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ds5Etm1wWg", "description": "I let my non driver license cousin drive me on Autopia and this is the MADDNESS that happened.

AIS information supplements marine radar, which continues to be the primary method of collision avoidance for water transport.\nA marine traffic coordinator using AIS and radar to manage vessel traffic.\nAn AIS-equipped system on board a ship presents the bearing and distance of nearby vessels in a radar-like display format.\nA graphical display of AIS data on board a ship.\n\nInformation provided by AIS equipment, such as unique identification, position, course, and speed, can be displayed on a screen or an ECDIS. AIS is intended to assist a vessel's watchstanding officers and allow maritime authorities to track and monitor vessel movements. AIS integrates a standardized VHF transceiver with a positioning system such as a LORAN-C or GPS receiver, with other electronic navigation sensors, such as a gyrocompass or rate of turn indicator. Ships outside AIS radio range can be tracked with the Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) system with less frequent transmission.\n\nThe International Maritime Organization's (IMO) International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) requires AIS to be fitted aboard international voyaging ships with gross tonnage (GT) of 300 or more tons, and all passenger ships regardless of size. It is estimated that more than 40,000 ships currently carry AIS class A equipment.[citation needed] In 2007, the new Class B AIS standard was introduced which enabled a new generation of low cost AIS transceivers.

We have observed that this red onion bulb started to develop 3 roots in the tap water in just 3days.  We therefore used tap water containing plant food to continue the cultivation. Our video shows 11days of hydroponic cultivation of this red onion bulb.

Normal salad dressing is actually a healthier concoction of vinegar and plant oils. Those ingredients help to control blood sugar and can even contain antioxidants. . However food companies jumped on the diet bandwagon and added  high fructose corn syrup, sugar and emulsifying agents in place of the good substances to create an unnatural and ultimately unhealthy blend.\n\n\nNumber 2 -- Stay away from Seitan. For those unfamiliar with it, Seitan is described as a vegetarian friendly meat substitute. However instead of being derived from soy, its actually made from wheat gluten, which is an allergenic protein, meaning that consuming high amounts may potentially lead to a severe gluten allergy or intolerance.\n\nNumber 1 -- Steer clear of sugar sweetened drinks like soda or sports and energy beverages.

I am going to talk about what natural or non-steroid-using people can expect. These numbers assume that the trainees are training properly, receiving appropriate nutrition, and are meeting all other major recovery factors. Younger trainees can generally expect to build muscle faster than older trainees. Also, genetically gifted people may be able to reach for more while genetically unlucky individuals may have to accept less. Just because your current state may be considered \"underdeveloped,\" do not make assumptions about your genetic limitations. It is very demotivating, and premature in many cases to assume that your current state reflects your genetic potential. Lifestyle has a huge affect on your current state, so don't immediately start worrying about those genetic limitations!\n\nGenerally speaking: first year trainees can expect to gain 20+ pounds of muscle, second year trainees can expect to gain 10+ pounds of muscle, third year trainees can expect to gain 5+ pounds, and so on until barely any muscle gains occur. These numbers are less for females. The more advanced your development, the harder it becomes to build more muscle. At some point every trainee will have a basic natural limitation to how much muscle their body can grow. It is worth noting that teenagers going through major growth may be able to add greater amounts than what is suggested.\n\nJust to make it clear, people can gain substantially greater amounts of fat per year. Don't be fooled into thinking you can gain outrageous amounts of muscle per year as a natural bodybuilder simply by eating ridiculous amounts of food. Gaining muscle indeed involves gaining some fat, but there is no need to gain a substantially greater portion of fat than necessary. Remember, it's not all about weighing a certain magic number because of your height, it is also about being inside a healthy body fat percentage range. I am not suggesting you need to maintain a six-pack while \"bulking,\" but there's no need to gain 70 pounds to add 20 pounds of muscle. Eat big, but don't eat obese. \n\nDISCLAIMER: BEFORE STARTING A NEW EXERCISE PROGRAM YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH A MEDICAL DOCTOR OR YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IF YOU HAVE CHRONIC HEALTH ISSUES, PRE-EXISTING INJURIES, A SERIOUS ILLNESS, OR ANY HEALTH CONDITION THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. GENERALLY, IT IS BEST TO SLOWLY ACCLIMATE YOURSELF TO THE INTENSITY LEVEL OF A NEW EXERCISE PROGRAM. FOR THIS REASON AS WELL AS OTHERS, I ADVISE ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS OF ANY AGE TO START ANY PROGRAM WITH JUST THE BARE BAR OR EXTREMELY LIGHT WEIGHTS TO LEARN PROPER FORM BEFORE ADDING WEIGHT.", "title": "Building Muscle - How Long Does It Take & How Much Can I Expect to Build?", "publishedDate": "2013-07-11T02:00:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ecfhEBIKWw", "description": "Laugh everyday.

For other uses, see Grain (disambiguation).\nThis article is about cereals in general. For the breakfast food, see Breakfast cereal.\nCereals, or cereal grains, are mostly grasses (Poaceae or Gramineae) cultivated for their edible brans or fruit seeds (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis). Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more energy worldwide than any other type of crop; they are therefore staple crops. They are also a rich source of carbohydrates. In some developing nations, grain in the form of rice, wheat, or maize constitutes a majority of daily sustenance. In developed nations, cereal consumption is more moderate and varied but still substantial.\n\n\nThe word cereal derives from Ceres, the name of the pre-Roman goddess of harvest and agriculture. Cereal grain is called corn in the United Kingdom and Ireland. But in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, maize is called corn.\n\nCereal grains are members of the monocot family Poaceae.", "title": "The Cereal Theme song a parody of Messy Marv & Guce - So Hood", "publishedDate": "2009-03-11T18:38:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "4enwctMKlbU", "description": "I watched this like 100 times and LOL!!

An event known as \"The Collapse\", an attack from the Darkness, an unknown faction or entity, saw the dissolution of these colonies and left mankind on the brink of extinction. The only known survivors of the Collapse are those living on Earth, who were saved by the Traveler. The Traveler hovers above the last remaining human city as a large spherical body, and its presence gives the Guardians of the City\u2014the last defenders of the human race\u2014the ability to wield an unknown power. Upon mankind's first attempt to repopulate and reconstruct after the Collapse, it was discovered that hostile alien races have occupied mankind's former colonies and civilizations. The player takes on the role of a Guardian of the City, and is tasked with investigating and destroying these threats before the remnants of humanity are completely wiped out.\n\nPeople include: Human, Awoken, Exo, Notable Personalities and Vendors.

Just like it. Fire aura is badass.\n5: It's been one of my favourites since RB1. I love the blue wispy aura in the move. Also, what Gohan says in the attack perfectly matches up with when you transform into SSJ2 \"Don't expect any mercy from me.\"\n4:  Cruelness is off the charts. Smirking, casual shoving from the back, it is humiliating to be on the receiving end of one of these.\n3: A greatly improved move from back in BT3, with only visual differences in RB1. Now, Freeza kicks the ball around for a bit. It blew my mind the first time I saw this move in this game.\n2: Similar to #3, but even MORE improved. In BT3, it was just a straight-fired missile. No cutscene, no tracking, no nothing. Now, we have heat-vision, the target imploding, and a large explosion. Pure awesomesauce.\n1: Best counter, and cutscene super in the game.

Until recently, sea lions were grouped under a single subfamily called Otariinae, whereas fur seals were grouped in the subfamily Arcocephalinae. This division was based on the most prominent common feature shared by the fur seals and absent in the sea lions, namely the dense underfur characteristic of the latter. Recent genetic evidence, however, strongly suggests Callorhinus, the genus of the northern fur seal, is more closely related to some sea lion species than to the other fur seal genus, Arctocephalus. Therefore, the fur seal/sea lion subfamily distinction has been eliminated from many taxonomies. Sea lions are related to the walrus and the seal. Nonetheless, all fur seals have certain features in common: the fur, generally smaller sizes, farther and longer foraging trips, smaller and more abundant prey items and greater sexual dimorphism. All sea lions have certain features in common, in particular their coarse, short fur, greater bulk and larger prey than fur seals. For these reasons, the distinction remains useful.", "title": "Sea lion", "publishedDate": "2013-03-14T06:23:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "4f7wBBJtMxM", "description": "", "title": "prolog 03 factorial", "publishedDate": "2012-12-31T14:25:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "4f89o0anGj4", "description": "I see the small leaves as we speed past a roadside Melia azedarach with phytoplasma!", "title": "Yellow hills of Nainital", "publishedDate": "2008-01-28T00:58:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "4f8FHw4u_7Y", "description": "http://www.thegrommet.com/433-the-right-mat-outdoor-doormats-made-from-recycled-lobster-float-rope\nThe Grommet team shares the unique history behind these outdoor doormats made from lobster float ropes.", "title": "The Right Mat - Reclaimed Fishing Rope Doormat", "publishedDate": "2012-05-23T17:40:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "4f8YToP_5dQ", "description": "Zu Besuch in einer von Samen betiebenen Rentier-Farm, der Inga-S\u00e1mi-Siida,  bei Kvalsaukan auf der Vester\u00e5len-Insel Hinn\u00f8ya, Nordnorwegen.\nMehr \u00fcber die Rentierfarm und die Insel Hinn\u00f8ya steht unter\nhttp://www.reisen.realedition.de/Europa/norwegen-lofoten/seite9.html.\nDas ganze Video dieser Nordnorwegen-Reise gibt es unter\nhttp://www.reisevideos.realedition.de/europa/norwegen-lofoten/index.html.", "title": "Rentier-Farm in Kvalsaukan auf Hinn\u00f8ya - Vester\u00e5len", "publishedDate": "2013-01-27T16:28:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "4f8lWl5eQ9A", "description": "Panama was represented for the first time at the 2014 Rose Parade in Pasadena, United States.

I really do.  Those people in life whom, although outwardly unassuming, are possessed of a vast and as-yet-unproclaimed talent.  Passionate... driven in their efforts... they just... get it.  And, to get to work alongside people like that?  Truly a gift.\n\nSo, why do I bring this up, you ask?  Because recently, I've been fortunate enough to work with one such person.  Nick Navatta.\n\nI met Nick several months back on a speaking engagement at a music industry seminar (I was there as a guest speaker and he was there, god bless him, to create an elaborate whiteboard collage from my ramblings.  And let's face it... I can ramble... a lot. :)).  Anyway, we kept in touch after that, and when YouTube contacted me in late November to create a holiday video... Nick was my first call.  At that point, I'd seen only his cartoon-esque work, but knowing I wanted to do an animated video (rather than your favorite 3-angle-buttercream-wall-behind-me cover treatment :))... I thought it'd be fun to try.  Honestly, I had NO IDEA he was such a versatile artist, and what he ended up creating... quite frankly... blows me away.  Using only a single canvas... sketched, photographed, and resketched 15 HUNDRED times... he brought my original Christmas song 'Evergreen' to life.\n\nAs to the song itself, 'Evergreen' is a co-write with a great songwriter (and good friend) Simone Porter, and we originally wrote it for a FlatStar (Germany's version of American Idol) winner named Fabian Buch.  Because Fabian is German, Simone thought it'd be interesting to incorporate imagery from German holiday legend resulting in lines like '10,000 rivers turn to wine' and 'church bells ring out from the sea'...  In the end, Fabian didn't wind up recording the song, but as I'd recorded the demo myself (and subsequently fallen in love with Simone's lyrics)... it just felt right to put it on my own album.\n\nIn general, I try hard to leave the sharing, liking, retweeting, and forwarding up to you (i.e. - not specifically ASK you to do that, but instead... let you decide for yourself if you feel my work is worthy of that)... but in this case... I could really use your help. :)  Nick put a lot of time and effort into this piece, and I'd love to see his work get the recognition it deserves.  If you have a free minute to check out the video and possibly send it around to your friends/family... well... that'd be awesome. :)  Thank you...\n\nGavin\n\nNICK'S INFO - http://www.youtube.com/nicknavatta1 // nick@nicknavatta.com \nSIMONE'S INFO - http://twitter.com/simoneporter // musicisproof@gmail.com\n\n______________________\n\nwith lyrics:\n\nEVERGREEN\nWritten by Gavin Mikhail & Simone Porter\n\nOutside the window Christmas Eve unfolds\nThe moon is shining down upon the snow\nChristmas cheer, the family feasts\nFill the air with things so sweet\nThere's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be... \n\nAnd I can feel the magic here tonight\nAs ten thousand rivers turn to wine\nAnd church bells ring out from the sea\nThe sweetest carols play aloud\nTo children laughing in the crowd\nAs your light's shining down on me\nEvergreen...\n\nWith every candle lit you come to life\nAs all the children wait with anxious eyes\nIt's almost time to look your way\nSo every heart will sing today\nOf peace and love and hope and joy and grace...\n\nAnd I can feel the magic here tonight\nAs ten thousand rivers turn to wine\nAnd church bells ring out from the sea\nThe sweetest carols play aloud\nTo children laughing in the crowd\nAs your light's shining down on me\nEvergreen...\n\nIn all your glory\nEvergreen\nYou hold a place\nEvergreen\nInside my heart on Christmas Day...\n\nI can feel the magic here tonight\nAs ten thousand rivers turn to wine\nAnd church bells ring out from the sea\nI can feel the magic here tonight\nAs ten thousand rivers turn to wine\nAnd church bells ring out from the sea\nThe sweetest carols play aloud\nTo children laughing in the crowd\nWith your light shining down on me\nEvergreen...", "title": "Gavin Mikhail - Evergreen (original animated Christmas song)", "publishedDate": "2011-12-04T06:47:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "4fBJITnExLI", "description": "LASEK, o \"queratomileusis epitelial in situ\" asistida por l\u00e1ser, es una variaci\u00f3n del LASIK, se trata de una t\u00e9cnica en la que se remodela el tejido corneal para que el ojo vea mejor sin anteojos o lentes de contacto. \n\nEl epitelio (capa superior de la c\u00f3rnea) se ablanda con una soluci\u00f3n de alcohol para crear un colgajo en la c\u00f3rnea.

Little else was known about its origins, other than the supposed fact that the 8mm film was discovered in an attic and purchased at an estate sale. \n\nThe film you are about to watch is the complete, unedited version. I strongly recommend viewing the film throughout its entirety, from beginning to end.  Pay attention to details, they will be important later.\n\nTwo days ago, an important new piece of evidence surfaced which, if true, may lead to solving the mystery of the Gable Film. Check out the video posted by YouTube user QuinlanOUR12.  I feel obligated to post a note of warning here: if this new footage is indeed authentic, then it is extremely graphic and disturbing. Viewer discretion is advised.\n\nQuestions remain. What was the creature that attacked the cameraman in the original Gable Film?

Die Bl\u00e4tter der Keulenlilien wachsen in einer lockeren Rosette. Die vertrocknenden unteren Bl\u00e4tter der Pflanze kann man leicht entfernen, es zeigt sich der gedrungen wachsende kahle Stamm.\n\nUnterschiedliche Blattformen\nBei einigen Arten wachsen die Bl\u00e4tter lang, schmal und nach unten gew\u00f6lbt. Andere Cordyline Arten wachsen mit k\u00fcrzeren und breiteren Bl\u00e4ttern, die an den Spitzen und an den Stilans\u00e4tzen schmal zulaufen.\n\nCordyline stralis\nCordyline australis bildet ledrige, schwertf\u00f6rmige, leicht gebogene gr\u00fcn gef\u00e4rbte Bl\u00e4tter, die eine L\u00e4nge von etwa 70 bis 90 cm und eine Breite von 5 cm erreichen.\n\nCordyline australis \"Atropurpurea\"\nBei Cordyline australis \"Atropurpurea\" sind die Mittelrippen und der Blattgrund purpurrot gef\u00e4rbt.\n\nCordyline australis \"Doucetii\"\nCordyline australis \"Doucetii\", bildet wei\u00dfliche L\u00e4ngsstreifen \u00fcber das ganze Blatt aus.\n\nCordyline fruticosa\nCordyline fruticosa, auch unter Cordyline terminalis bekannt, w\u00e4chst mit bis zu 50 cm langen, lanzettf\u00f6rmigen, sich an der Spitze und am Blattgrund stark verj\u00fcngenden Bl\u00e4ttern. Frisch ausgetriebene Bl\u00e4tter sind kr\u00e4ftig karminrot gef\u00e4rbt und werden im Alter gr\u00fcn-rot marmoriert. Zu den verbreiteten Sorten geh\u00f6ren:\n\nCordyline fruticosa \"Amabilis\"\nCordyline ticosa \"Amabilis\" mit breiten, stark gl\u00e4nzenden Bl\u00e4ttern, die auf bronzefarbenem Untergrund einen leicht rosaroten Schimmer bilden. Die R\u00e4nder der Bl\u00e4tter dieser Sorte sind cremefarben.\nPflege der Cordyline\nLicht / Standort\n\nCordyline australis ben\u00f6tigt einen hellen Standort mit direkter Sonnenbestrahlung. Cordyline fruticosa und die dazugeh\u00f6rigen Sorten d\u00fcrfen keine direkte, starke Sonnenbestrahlung bekommen. Diese Pflanzen bekommen einen hellen Standort mit einem guten Schutz vor der prallen Mittagssonne.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nIn der Hauptwachstumszeit gie\u00dft man die Cordylinen reichlich, der Wurzelballen sollte beim Gie\u00dfen gr\u00fcndlich durchfeuchtet werden und vor der n\u00e4chsten Wassergabe nicht antrocknen. Sich nach dem Gie\u00dfen im Untersetzter ansammelndes Wasser muss aber entfernt werden, ansonsten droht Staun\u00e4sse und damit verbundene Wurzelf\u00e4ulnis. W\u00e4hrend der Ruhezeit schr\u00e4nkt man die H\u00e4ufigkeit des Gie\u00dfens ein und achtet nur darauf, dass der Topfballen nicht austrocknet.\nTemperatur\n\nCordyline fruticosa kultiviert man bei normalen Zimmertemperaturen. Cordyline  australis vertr\u00e4gt niedrigere Temperaturen bis 12 \u00b0C.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nIm zeitigen Fr\u00fchjahr k\u00f6nnen die Keulenlilien aus Samen herangezogen werden. Daf\u00fcr bringt man die Samen etwa 1,5 cm tief in Aussaaterde ein und stellt die T\u00f6pfe in einen beheizten Vermehrungskasten. Alternativ st\u00fclpt man einen Plastikbeutel \u00fcber die Saatgef\u00e4\u00dfe. An einem hellen Standort ohne direkte Sonnenbestrahlung sollten die Samen nach etwa 5 bis 6 Wochen keimen. Sobald die kleinen S\u00e4mlinge eine Gr\u00f6\u00dfe von 7 bis 10 cm erreicht haben, entfernt man die Abdeckungen und behandelt die kleinen Keulenlilien wie gro\u00dfe Exemplare.\nErde / Substrat\n\nCordylinen kultiviert man in Erde auf Kompostbasis.\nUmtopfen\n\nIm Fr\u00fchjahr k\u00f6nnen die Pflanzen in einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Topf umgesetzt werden.\nD\u00fcngen / N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf\n\nIn der Hauptwachstumszeit wird alle 14 Tage mit einem Fl\u00fcssigd\u00fcnger in m\u00e4\u00dfiger Konzentration ged\u00fcngt.", "title": "Cordyline, Keulenlilie", "publishedDate": "2014-07-21T08:58:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "4fEN4bHTEfE", "description": "", "title": "lamb at the pythian castle", "publishedDate": "2011-09-05T03:03:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "4fF9dT_7Jeg", "description": "Former Radio 1 DJ Mike Read has apologised for \"unintentionally causing offence\" with his song UKIP Calypso which he wants withdrawn from sale.

Market manipulators do. This is the greatest bargain in human history.\n\nWill we actually make a profit from buying silver as the price rises or is it simply rising as a consequence of the dollar decreasing in value? I'm assuming that as more people begin buying silver and it goes on a run that supply /demand will actually make it worth more in real terms, especially considering that the prices are artificially suppressed right now.\n\nA good bit of research. I noticed by looking at a 600 year old silver chart priced in 1998 Dollars. The current price is ridiculously low. Silver was short in Europe up until about 1400 then, a huge new supply started coming in from South and central America via the Spanish. Later in the 1800s, the US and mexico using mechanised mining again produced massive amounts of silver.\n\nSilver was demonetised in 1873 by the banksters. This meant there were massive amounts of silver vaulted up. Now it's all gone and the current price is only a tiny fraction of the prices in the middle ages. This was when silver was the most plentiful in the western world ever.\n\nThe lowest price for 600 years was actually in 2001!!!!!\n\nWhy they have to manipulate silver: For many decades the rate of inflation has been falsified downward. This is because inflation is a hidden tax on paper money so they have an interest to downplay it. The problem is that the inflation rate is a compounding figure because each annual percentage rate is a percentage rate of the new total of the previous year. They try and show you a flat curve and refer the the rate as \"stable\" but each progressive new year there's really an ever increasing curve that get steeper as time goes on. In the end they have to progressively cheat the new figure even more which of course pushes the curve even steeper. Eventually it will go parabolic and the bubble system will collapse.\n\nIf they didn't manipulate the price downward the real inflation would be exposed because the PMs are not really moving in value but the bubble money in getting progressively more worthless at a faster rate.\n\nAs soon as the perception of say for instance, a Silver one ounce eagle becomes that of a monetary unit. then the true price discovery will start. This is the banksters worse nightmare because it exposes the fact that they have robbed the system blind essentially through deceit and fraud. Then the confidence is gone and the inflation which can now longer be hidden goes to hyperinflation.\n\nThey are already printing which means they can never stop printing because it's all issued as debt so there will never be enough money to ever settle. In history it goes into hyperinflation and the banksters never stop printing because even if it costs a million buck for a loaf of bread it costs less than a loaf of bread for a bankster to type in an account entry on a computer.\n\nIn the end it goes to zero which is it's intrinsic value as is always replaced with a commodity money, usually some sort of gold backing. I can't find any instances where an unbacked system that collapsed has ever successfully been replaced by another unbacked system no matter how well intentioned or well thought out it was.\n\nThe commodity money can restore confidence and enforce prudent discipline. After a while, A very well run token system can be started and run alongside it. The soft currency allows more growth and investment whilst the commodity money guards the fort of a store of value for savers.", "title": "Silver - Will Prices Catch Up to Gold Ratio 3.3 : 1", "publishedDate": "2012-10-08T20:57:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "4fLLteiSFlg", "description": "Become our friend on FACEBOOK:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/planetpunkmusicofficial\n\nCopyright protected work.

GEOGRAPHICALLY\nThe biggest part of King Philip's ancient Macedonia was mainly in Greece. Geographically there are 2 more Macedonians as part of Bulgaria and Skopje, but no important historic event took place there. Not to mention that the area above Skopje was never part of the Greek Macedonia. Where as Macedonian history took place in Greece (Pella, Vergina etc.).\n2. ETHNOLOGICALLY\nThey use Cyrillic Bulgarian alphabet but they are Slavs that came in the area after the 6th century aC. Kyro Gligorov, their ex president admitted this.\nThey used a Slavobulgarian dialect that they named as \"Macedonian language\", a thing that doesn't exist. Based upon this fake language they name themselves Macedonians.\nThe truth is that they are Slavish people speaking a Bulgarian dialect.\n3. HISTORICALLY\nTheir unhistorical arguments of a connection to ancient Macedonia and a discrimination between ancient Greeks and ancient totally fail and is a product of Propaganda. Historically and culturally Slavs have nothing to do with ancient Macedonia, which history began 1000 years before they came in the Balcanic area. I don't have to mention that Alexander was Greek, spoke Greek and all Macedonian is without any doubt Greek.\n\n\n\"We do not claim to be descendants of Alexander the Great...we are Slavs and we speak a Slav language.\" Ljubica Achevska,2001. \n\n\"We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great.

The creation of this unique model is the synthesis resulting from the combined perspectives of the two brands.\nEugenio Franzetti, Public Relations Manager of Peugeot Italia, says: \"Peugeot and Castagna have so many values in common that it was inevitable their paths would cross, sooner or later. First of all, tradition: Castagna was established in 1849, Peugeot has over 200 years of history... it is no surprise that we met at a vintage car\nAs a matter of fact, both Brands have a veritable cult of tradition. Peugeot preserves its heritage at the Sochaux Museum (France) and can boast an organization - \"L'Aventure Peugeot\" -- which unites all the Lion's Classic Car Clubs existing globally, including Peugeot Italy's Club Storico.\n\"The past is a continuous source of inspiration for the future;\" adds Eugenio Franzetti \"If we look at the history of our models, it clearly emerges that Peugeot has always pursued innovation and development within its model range, either by manufacturing unique models or by drawing upon independent body stylists, for its sports models like the Dar'l Mats or for series production cars, where the collaboration with the car designer Pininfarina is exemplary. Therefore, it was perhaps an obvious decision to sublimate the intrinsic values of the Peugeot models -- quality finish, attention to detail, real driving enjoyment -- in the production of a unique model that could incorporate the typical values of the Castagna products: development of new materials and their unprecedented mix and match; the warmth, the refinement and the originality of its creations, the scrupulous quality craftsmanship.\"\nCastagna chose the 508 RXH model, the flagship of the range for Peugeot given its generous equipment and it was its \"Allroad\" design that provoked and inspired the coachbuilder from Milan to express his creativity and enhance the premium quality features of this model.\nCurrently, 508 RXH is the highest technological expression of the Peugeot brand. Its innovative HYbrid4 technology allows to mate a 2.0 litre, 163 bhp front diesel engine with a 37 bhp rear electric motor, capable of delivering a maximum power of 200 bhp that can be best exploited, depending upon the circumstances, by selecting one of the four modes foreseen by the drive mode selection knob positioned on the central tunnel.\nYou can select the Auto mode to privilege riding comfort and sustainable mobility, or the Sport mode to maximise performance and available power. However you can also ride in the ZEV mode relying only on the electric motor or use the 4WD to exploit the two powertrains and continuously power the front and rear wheels.\n\"Together with Castagna, we set out from the distinctive features of the 508 RXH and from its HYbrid4 technology to imagine a journey. The journey of a successful man who lives in an urban context but who is also keen to escape for short getaways in the countryside or for short mountain skiing holidays, and travels through these different landscapes in the environmentally - friendly way which a hybrid car allows\" concludes Eugenio Franzetti.\nIt is now the turn of Gioacchino Acampora, Castagna Coachbuilder's chief designer, to reveal his sources of inspiration for this car: \"It is no secret: over the last few years -- and I even wrote it \"back in the day\" - I have stated my admiration for French design and the manner in which the French make products. However, since when I had the opportunity to drive some of the Lion's cars, my actual feelings have surpassed my expectations. Recent prototypes developed by Peugeot like the Onyx concept car, are astonishing due to the use of natural and warm materials, providing a marked contrast to the \"logical\" aspect of the geometrical lines.\nThe underlying idea is simply to allow the spirit of the car to emerge through the use of a single colour. I have often experienced that magical sensation of noiseless drive that this car provides. Sometimes, one would purposely choose a given route just to get lost in the sound of silence: so strong was the desire for \"mimesis\" at a certain point. We drew inspiration from all this to develop a livery that blended the interior to the exterior of the car in a single seamless chromatic tone and this was possible thanks to Lechler and Alcantara.\nhttp://www.carwp.com.br/2014/02/castagna-peugeot-508-rxh-hybrid4-2014.html\nFind us on https://www.facebook.com/pages/Carwp/505636076134244\nDOWNLOAD IMAGES: http://CARWP.com.br\nRoyalty Free Music by http://audiomicro.com/royalty-free-music\nSound Effects by http://audiomicro.com/sound-effects", "title": "DETALHES Castagna Peugeot 508 RXH Hybrid4 2014 aro 19 2.0 200 cv", "publishedDate": "2014-02-18T23:06:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "4fdCB9NdKd4", "description": "Check car tire tread wear to ensure safety when tires near their mileage limit; learn how from our expert mechanic in this free car-maintenance video.\n\nExpert: Jeff Wong\nBio: Jeff Wong has a masters degree in Mechanical Engineering.

Water Bureau Administrator David Shaff said 38 million gallons will be discarded because a 19-year-old was caught in the act on Wednesday. Two years ago, the city drained a 7.5 million-gallon reservoir.\n\nThe open reservoirs hold water that's already been treated and goes directly into mains for distribution to customers. The urine poses little health risk, but city officials don't want customers to think the water's tainted. Shaff says the city has plenty of water to meet demand. The reservoir is one of five the city is in the process of replacing with underground storage to comply with federal regulations.\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976: Allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

But some Swedes feel it's being taken to extremes. It has the highest proportion of working women in the world and some two-thirds of university degrees are earned by women. New mothers and fathers both get generous parental leave.\n\nGender role neutrality initiatives, however, some feel are being exaggerated. Some critics say Sweden's government is taking a feminist agenda to an almost radical level.\n\nThere's a politician who proposed that men should be required by law to urinate in a sitting position. That politician, Viggo Hansen of the Swedish Left Party, says: \"When my son was in kindergarten, they tried to force him to pee standing up, when we had taught him to pee sitting down. When the school let him sit down to pee, there was no problem. I had read about a school in Norway that officially banned boys' stand-up peeing. Lots of people's reaction was that was taking away boys' right to be boys.\"\n\nAnn Helena Rudberg joined the feminist movement in the 1970s, to fight for women's rights because she saw her mother suffer violence at home. Today she argues women have equal rights and that feminist political parties are taking things too far.\n\nRudberg says: \"It's a power struggle between men and women. And the effect of that is that on one side we have women and on the other side men. And this is not good for the children or for anyone.\"\n\nAired on: 8 Mar, 2013.", "title": "Swedish Feminism Has Gone Too Far", "publishedDate": "2013-09-19T15:45:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "4fgZvvmP46A", "description": "Subscribe Now:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ehowgarden\n\nWatch More:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/ehowgarden\n\nWinterizing a hibiscus plant is something you do before the weather even starts getting cold.

These situations are actually the major causes of anxiety and if you could not keep yourself away from them, you are more likely to develop a much more serious condition.\n\nWhat is Anxiety?\nAnxiety is a natural emotional condition individuals usually experience as a result of stressful circumstances and difficult situations that are inevitable in nature.\n\nWhat Causes Anxiety?\nThe cause of anxiety is commonly linked to environmental or physical factors. When a person is faced in a rather difficult situation, he or she tends to respond by unconsciously thinking that something bad is about to happen. The following are the common environmental factors that are linked to anxiety:\n\u2022 Stress from school, work, or any activities\n\u2022 Stress caused by natural calamities\n\u2022 Emotional stress caused by personal relationships\n\u2022 Substance intoxication\n\nWhat are the Symptoms of Anxiety?\nThe following are the typical signs you would experience while having an anxiety:\n\u2022 Tense and jumpy feelings\n\u2022 Restlessness\n\u2022 Feeling scared of possible danger\n\u2022 Difficulty concentrating\n\u2022 Increased heart rate\n\u2022 Sweating\n\u2022 Insomnia\n\u2022 Headache\n\nThe Anxiety Attack\nOn the other hand, anxiety attacks or sometimes called as panic attacks happen when there are sudden outbreaks of heightened and intensified anxiety. This condition can be considered as worse compared to a plain anxiety sensation. \n\nSymptoms of Anxiety Attack\nThere are a number of anxiety attack symptoms that one can look out for. Unlike an ordinary anxiety, this condition is characterized by serious symptoms such as:\n\u2022 Low rapid breathing\n\u2022 Racing heartbeat\n\u2022 Dizziness \n\u2022 Shakiness\n\u2022 Palpitations\n\u2022 Numbness\n\u2022 Disorientation\n\u2022 Feeling of hopelessness\n\u2022 Feeling of dying\n\nWhat are the treatments for Anxiety?\nHaving anxiety is never a good case to be in. In light of this, treatment for anxiety attacks is continually being developed. Anxiety treatments include:\n\u2022 Pharmacological Treatments\nOne anxiety treatment is by pharmacological means. Commonly prescribed medications for anxiety are antidepressants, Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), Benzodiazepines, Alpha-delta calcium channel class of anticonvulsants and Beta-blockers.\n\u2022 Psychotherapy\nAlthough medications are faster when it comes to their effects in treating anxiety, it may not provide you the complete cure without incorporating psychotherapy. This type of treatment is one of the distinguished treatments effective for anxiety. It is a natural approach that includes a set of techniques that help ease the anxiety symptoms and get over the condition.\n\nThe Importance of Preventing Yourself from anxiety \nHaving an anxiety becomes an aggravating situation not just to you but also to the people around you since they will normally be affected by your condition. Usually, this condition does not only obstruct your daily activities but it can even disturb and trouble you. \n\nWhen you have anxiety, it is important for you to reduce the symptoms and relieve it as well as find measures to possibly get rid of it.\n\nIf you are at risk of developing anxiety, preventing yourself away from it is essential for you to avoid the painful symptoms that may definitely affect you not just emotionally but mentally and physically as well.\n\nOne Great Way to Overcome Anxiety \nThankfully, anxiety can be prevented and relieved not only by limiting your options to pharmacological and psychotherapy treatment.

Percorrendo la pista ciclopedonale compresa tra il lungomare Duca degli Abruzzi e la marina di San Salvo, \u00e8 possibile apprezzare uno degli ambienti dunali meglio conservati della costa adriatica, con la tipica successione vegetazionale che dalle piante pi\u00f9 esposte alla salsedine marina, quali la Cakile marittima (ruchetta di mare), sfuma nei cordoni consolidati da Elytrigia juncea (agropiro) e Ammophila littoralis. Sentieri attrezzati percorrono i vari settori dell'area protetta: l'ambiente retrodunale \u00e8 interessante per il notevole sviluppo delle praterie umide dove fioriscono la camomilla di mare e il giglio delle sabbie. Qui nidifica il fratino, piccolo uccello della duna. Facilmente osservabili sono anche il cardellino, il verdone, il verzellino, il saltimpalo e il beccamoschino. Le depressioni umide retrodunali sono assiduamente frequentate da uccelli di passo, rappresentati da varie specie di aironi, quali il cinerino, l'airone rosso e l'airone bianco maggiore. Questo \u00e8 anche l'habitat tradizionale del rospo smeraldino e della testuggine palustre. \n\nRecognised as a Site of Communitarian Interest (SIC) this coastal biotope stretches out for about 60 hectares in the Marina of Vasto, running parallel to the Adriatic highway and ending with the Mediterranean Botanical Garden, in the San Salvo territory just beyond the Buonanotte stream. By taking the cycle and pedestrian lane existing between the Duca degli Abruzzi seafront and the Marina of San Salvo, one can admire the best maintained dune environment of the Adriatic coast, with a succession of typical vegetation starting from the plants that are most exposed to brackish water such as the Cakile Marittima (the sea rocket), slowly fading into the consolidated barriers of the Sand Couch Grass (agropyron crystatum) and the sand binding Marram grass. Well-equipped trails run through the various protected area's sectors: the humid environment behind the dunes is interesting due to the exceptional development of the humid prairies where the sea chamomiles bloom along with the sand lilies.

Both women also worked in the nearby red light district as prostitutes.\n\nWhen friends noticed that Ningshi\u2019s FB and WhatsApp had gone silent they assumed she had finally been caught and arrested by Hong Kong police for prostitution. They never imagined that her body was lying in the apartment of a 29 year old British expat named Rurik Jutting.\n\nOther working girls would later say they\u2019d seen both women go off with foreign men on the nights they disappeared, but were unable to say whether or not those men were one in the same.\n\nRurik Jutting lived in the apartment where the women were found and he also reported the crime to the police on Saturday. The area is popular with high-rolling financial expats living in Hong Kong. Jutting had only just recently quit his job with Bank of America Merrill Lynch last week.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

I lived in Chihuahua Mexico from the time I was 5 until the age of 12. At the age of 12 I ran away from home and lived on my own and homeless throughout Mexico until I was 16 years old. During that time I lived under bridges and under the stars. I was a cowboy, a field hand, construction worker and a clam digger. I developed a love for Ranchera music when I was a kid after going to the cantinas and standing outside the door and listening to the Mariachi sing their songs. The music would soothe my heart and soul and make me forget I was hungry. I cannot sing or play the guitar and the little I know is self taught. I now live in California, USA. This is my rendition of Beautiful Mexico (Mexico Lindo). I can only hope that the composer of this song will forgive me. Please enjoy.  Also, please go watch me sing Corrido De Chihuahua Camino De Guanajuato El Rey and Las Mananitas which I sang for Mama Espinoza who turned 100 years old on October 16, 2007.\n\nHola, me llamo David y soy un gringo.

Este t\u00e9rmino se emplea preferentemente al hablar de la ascitis, que es la acumulaci\u00f3n de l\u00edquido en la cavidad peritoneal que aparece sobre todo en algunas enfermedades del h\u00edgado, como la cirrosis.\nA veces, el m\u00e9dico se ayuda de una ecograf\u00eda para localizar el sitio de punci\u00f3n, pero esto no es necesario la mayor\u00eda de las veces. Se emplean diferentes agujas. Tras limpiar la zona de punci\u00f3n con un antis\u00e9ptico, se punciona con la aguja perpendicular a la piel, dando salida al l\u00edquido. La paracentesis tiene escaso riesgo, pero a veces puede puncionar alguna estructura, como un vaso sangu\u00edneo o el bazo, dando lugar a complicaciones.\n\nParacentesis is a medical procedure involving needle drainage of fluid from a body cavity, most commonly the abdomen. It is used for a number of reasons:\n\nto relieve abdominal pressure from ascites \nto diagnose spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and other infections (e.g. abdominal TB) \nto diagnose metastatic cancer \nto diagnose blood in peritoneal space in trauma \nto puncture the tympanic membrane for diagnostic purposes, such as taking a bacterial swab from the middle ear. \nThe procedure is often done in a doctor's office or an out-patient clinic. In an expert's hands, it is very safe, although there is a very small risk of introducing an infection, causing excessive bleeding or perforating a loop of bowel.\n\nDuring the procedure, patients are asked to lie down and expose their abdomen. After cleaning the side of the abdomen with an antiseptic solution, physicians will numb a small area of skin and then insert a fairly large-bore needle (along with a plastic sheath) 2 to 5 cm to reach the peritoneal (ascitic) fluid. The needle is then removed, leaving the plastic sheath behind to allow drainage of the fluid. The fluid can be drained by gravity or by connection to a vacuum bottle. Up to 11 litres of fluid may be drained during the procedure. If fluid drainage is more than 5 litres, patients may receive intravenous serum albumin (25% albumin, 8g/L) to prevent hypotension (low blood pressure).\n\nThe procedure generally is not painful; patients require no sedation. As long as they are not too dizzy and maintain their blood pressure after the procedure, they can go home afterwards.", "title": "Paracentesis Abdominal En Ascitis por Probable C\u00e1ncer de H\u00edgado", "publishedDate": "2009-05-16T23:50:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "4gLxAOKTx7o", "description": "En los sectores de La Candelaria, Palo Verde y Catia, el Estado Venezolano activ\u00f3 Ferias de la Carne para expender una amplia gama de cortes del rubro a precios regulados.\n\nDesde primeras horas de la ma\u00f1ana, los consumidores han adquirido lomito, pulpa negra, costilla, lagarto, muchacho cuadrado, entre otros provenientes de los centros de beneficio y empresas socialistas del Estado.\n\nAdem\u00e1s de venta de carne, la red de Mercados de Alimentos (Mercal) ofreci\u00f3 a los asistentes productos de la canasta alimentaria, tales como aceite, arroz, leche en polvo, enlatados, pasta, jugos, az\u00facar, harina de ma\u00edz precocida, entre otros.", "title": "Gobierno activ\u00f3 feria de la carne en tres puntos del Distrito Capital", "publishedDate": "2011-05-18T02:21:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "4gMLeWiRtHs", "description": "\u300a\u5fc3\u6230\u300b(\u82f1\u8a9e\uff1aMaster of Play) \u662f\u9999\u6e2f\u96fb\u8996\u5ee3\u64ad\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\u61f8\u7591\u96fb\u8996\u5287\uff0c\u7531\u912d\u5c11\u79cb\u53ca\u9673\u8c6a\u9818\u929c\u4e3b\u6f14\u3002\n\n\u4f55\u50b2\u5152\u98fe\u6f14\u9773\u5146\u6960 (\u912d\u5c11\u79cb\u98fe\u6f14) \u7684\u5973\u5152\u9773\u82b7\u7e08 Tansy\u3002Tansy \u7684\u4e0b\u843d\u662f\u6b64\u5287\u7684\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u689d\u4e3b\u7dda\u3002\u9773\u82b7\u7e08\u572825\u5e74\u524d\u88ab\u7d81\u67b6\uff0c\u6b64\u5f8c\u4e0b\u843d\u4e0d\u660e\u300225\u5e74\u4f86\uff0c\u9773\u5146\u6960\u5805\u4fe1\u5973\u5152\u4ecd\u5728\u4eba\u9593\uff0c\u5805\u6301\u5c0b\u627e\u9773\u82b7\u7e08\u3002", "title": "\u4f55\u50b2\u5152 @ \u5fc3\u6230 \u8a2a\u554f (\u79cb\u5b98\u912d\u5c11\u79cb\u7684\u5973\u5152) Tansy", "publishedDate": "2014-04-05T09:42:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "4gMmslmTxJA", "description": "", "title": "GILGUERO COLOMBIANO.

The CB 204 had set off with the KD Paus for the Layang Layang atoll off western Sabah at 5 a.m. that day. \n\nAs the weather worsened, the larger KD Paus informed Marine Region Headquarters at 10:30 a.m. that both ships would return to base in Kota Kinabalu due to bad weather.\n\nBut as both vessels use different radio frequency signals, the CB204 did not receive the order to turn back from the KD Paus. The KD Paus uses VHF, or very high frequency signals, while the CB204 uses UHF, or ultra high frequency signals.\n\nThe CB 204 continued its journey toward its original destination. Its last known position prior to its disappearance was 20 nautical miles east of Mengalum Island.\n\nSix vessels and three aircraft were deployed as part of a search effort, but bad weather, which included strong winds of up to 50 kilometres per hour, complicated rescue efforts.\n\nAt around 3:00 p.m, the KD Ganas, one of the six vessels dispatched to locate the missing ship, received a distress call from the CB204.

Animals treated with \"bute\" are not allowed to enter the food chain as it may pose a risk to human health.\n\nFindus UK has already started a full recall of its lasagne products. It withdrew its 320g, 360g and 500g lasagne meals from supermarket shelves as a precautionary measure earlier this week.\n\nIt came after Comigel alerted Findus and Aldi that their products \"do not conform to specification\".\n\nIt advised them to remove Findus beef lasagne and Aldi's Today's Special frozen beef lasagne and Today's Special frozen spaghetti bolognese.\n\nTesco also decided to withdraw its Everyday Value spaghetti bolognese, which is produced at the same Comigel site.\n\nA Tesco spokesman said: \"We are aware of the results of the Findus tests and we will of course assist Findus with their recall process.\n\n\"Tests on our frozen Everyday Value spaghetti bolognese product are ongoing under our new DNA testing programme. We will inform our customers of the results as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe latest development in the contamination crisis comes days after supermarket chain Asda withdrew products supplied by a Northern Ireland company which was storing meat found to contain a high proportion of horse DNA.\n\nNewry-based Freeza Meats had been storing the consignment of meat, which was labelled as beef, on behalf of a supplier in the Irish Republic - Co Monaghan-based meat trader McAdam Foods.\n\nMcAdam Foods has insisted it had no knowledge that any of its meat contained horse DNA. It claimed the contaminated produce originated in Poland.\n\nThe meat had not entered the food chain and was not destined for Asda stores.\n\nAsda acknowledged that no trace of equine DNA had been found in products made by Freeza Meats, but said it was still temporarily removing its burger range from its stores as a precaution.\n\nBlog : http://patrynworldlatestnews.blogspot.com/\nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/patryn.worldlatestnews", "title": "Findus Beef Lasagne Meals 100% Horsemeat", "publishedDate": "2013-02-07T20:12:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "4gaXsF64OPM", "description": "Sanha\u00e7o do coqueiro, Tangar\u00e1 palmarum, Palm Tanager, p\u00e1ssaros silvestres, Brazilian fauna, wild birds, fauna brasiliana, uccelli selvatici, \u30d6\u30e9\u30b8\u30eb\u306e\u52d5\u7269\u76f8\u3001, \u91ce\u9ce5\u3001, fauna brasile\u00f1a, faune br\u00e9silienne, oiseaux sauvages, brasilianischen Fauna, Wildv\u00f6gel,", "title": "Sanha\u00e7o do coqueiro, Tangar\u00e1 palmarum, Palm Tanager, p\u00e1ssaros silvestres,", "publishedDate": "2013-05-16T17:32:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "4gavh_i29Wg", "description": "music track by lulu schmidt & SHABAN, ... part of a bigger desaster .... // cHeck for updates soon on www.carolaschmidt.com \npart of the project RITES OF ENERGY CANALIZATION by carola schmidt. berlin 2013 /// thanks to katharina g\u00f6bel.", "title": "LULU SCHMIDT feat. \u00c4IMI WEINHAUS - GIVE ME THE PAN !", "publishedDate": "2013-08-18T08:01:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "4gaxYs7YTrM", "description": "This was a quick experiment for class.

In flower from June through to September with the flowers lasting just a day before the petals drop off and blow away. It's a prodigious seeder with a possible output of 20,000 seeds per plant. The seed need light to germinate and is a shallow germinator. They can last for years in the soil until brought to the surface by cultivation or soil disturbance. : http://www.teagasc.ie/publications/2010/55/55_Guide_to_Identifying_Tillage_Weeds.pdf\n\nCorn Poppy - Papaver rhoeas  - is an annual herb growing up to 60 cm tall, with white latex and slender roots. The leaves are once or twice pinnately lobed, cut or toothed and stiffly hairy. The basal leaves are stalked, but the upper leaves are sessile (attached to the stem without a stalk). The showy scarlet flowers are 7-10 cm in diameter and are supported on long hairy stalks. The two free sepals fall as the flower opens. Each flower bears four rounded, overlapping, papery petals, which are normally vibrant blood red, though occasionally pink or white, and often have a dark blotch at the base. The petals are crumpled when in bud. The stamens (male parts) are numerous and the anthers (pollen-bearing parts) are bluish-black, and borne on slender black filaments. The stigma (female part that receives the pollen) is a disk with 8-12 rays. The fruit is a smooth, hairless capsule 1-2 cm long, which is almost globose and no more than twice as long as wide. The small seeds are released through pores that open at the top of the capsule. They can remain dormant in the soil for 80 years or more. \n\nThe association between poppies and the cycle of life has a long history, partly due to the fertile nature of the plant. A single plant can produce up to 60,000 seeds, which extrapolates to hundreds of millions of seeds in a field. It is also a result of the association of poppies with crop plants, and the yearly cycle of sowing seeds and reaping the harvest. Poppy seeds have been found mixed with Egyptian barley grains from around 2500 BC, and poppy seed heads were often associated with corn in images of the Roman crop goddess Ceres (or her Greek equivalent, Demeter). The common poppy is a cultural icon which has become associated with wartime remembrance, especially during Remembrance Day (or Anzac Day in some Commonwealth countries). It also has a long history of medicinal use. The flowers have been used in treating mild pain caused by earache, toothache and neuralgia, and an infusion of the petals is traditionally taken for coughs, insomnia and poor digestion.\n\nPoppy seeds have a nutty taste and are much used as a flavouring in cakes and bread, and the seed oil is highly esteemed in France and elsewhere. Young leaves of poppy can be eaten raw or cooked like spinach, and used to flavour soups and salads. They are best used when tender before the plant has produced flower buds.\n\nThe petals are a source of red dye used in some medicines and wines. Dried petals are occasionally used to give colour to pot-pourris.\n\nShirley poppies are ornamental cultivars of the common poppy, with petals ranging in colour from shades of scarlet and orange, to pink, yellow and white, in single, semi-double or double forms. http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Papaver-rhoeas.htm\n\nThe plant is a variable annual, forming a long-lived soil seed bank that can germinate when the soil is disturbed. In the northern hemisphere it generally flowers in late spring, but if the weather is warm enough other flowers frequently appear at the beginning of autumn. The flower is large and showy, with four petals that are vivid red, most commonly with a black spot at their base. Like many other species of Papaver, it exudes a white latex when the tissues are broken. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_rhoeas \n\nDeplas\u00f3l ver\u00f0ur 70 cm.

I am quite impressed with it. We\u02bcve seen very very nice plant results. Uh, we went through a little bit of drought this season and this field here -- even the high end where the SabrEXTM was used, we saw very little to no drought stress on the plants. We had very little fruit drop. In the other ( watermelon) fields I have that are not irrigated (untreated), they got beat up pretty bad.\nText Overlay : SabrEX root inoculant logo Text Overlay: Two weeks after Planting\nWhen I came out here (to the treated field ) at about the two week mark, I did notice where we applied the SabrEX that the vine growth on the plants was much larger than the non treated plants. Then I kinda kept checking on it about every two weeks from then on -- and it just expanded every time I checked. The vines were longer. There was more vigor. There were larger leaves. It covered the ground faster. We had ground cover quicker on this end of the field (treated with SabrEX) . On top of that, this is the higher end of the field. There is less water and it is a non irrigated field.

We dug some that were the SabrEX treated. They had a good foot and a half extra vine per plant. When we checked the roots out, they were completely out of the root ball from the transplant They were headed south into the ground. They looked very nice with a lot of fibers (root hairs ) on them.\nWhen we dug the untreated plants up, they still had that root ball look. The tap root was still wound there. They didn't have very deep rooting yet. They were quite a bit behind the root status (of the SabrEXTM treated plants). Just a night and day difference.\nText Overlay: Anything surprise you  SabrEX root inoculant logo\nWe harvested this field on the second of August - about 10 days ago or a little more than that now.

Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a well-known American actor whose career has gone into a tailspin; needing work, he takes a very large fee to appear in a commercial for Japanese whiskey to be shot in Tokyo. Feeling no small degree of culture shock in Japan, Bob spends most of his non-working hours at his hotel, where he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) at the bar. Twentysomething Charlotte is married to John (Giovanni Ribisi), a successful photographer who is in Tokyo on an assignment, leaving her to while away her time while he works. Beyond their shared bemusement and confusion with the sights and sounds of contemporary Tokyo, Bob and Charlotte share a similar dissatisfaction with their lives; the spark has gone out of Bob's marriage, and he's become disillusioned with his career. Meanwhile, Charlotte is puzzled with how much John has changed in their two years of marriage, while she's been unable to launch a creative career of her own. Bob and Charlotte become fast friends, and as they explore Tokyo, they begin to wonder if their sudden friendship might be growing into something more.\n\n\"lost in translation\",\"lost in translation clip\",\"lost in translation g eazy\",\"lost in translation part 1\",\"bill murray\",\"tetsuro naka\",\"camera videos\",\"drink videos\",\"independent comedies\",\"independent dramas\",comedy,\"dark humor black comedies\",drama,independent,\"francis ford coppola\",\"fred roos\",\"callum greene\",\"ross katz\",\"sofia coppola\",\"kiyoshi inoue\",\"mitch glazer\",\"stephen schible\",\"attitude videos\",\"communication videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++283628,/m/0p_pd", "title": "The Rat Pack Photo Shoot - Lost in Translation (3/10) Movie CLIP (2003) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-30T10:54:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "4gjs2gXN_0o", "description": "Testimonial Esophageal & Liver Cancer, This unique program offered home instruction or you can register for the ReTreat Facility Cancer Trial.

He composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig for the 17th Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 1 October 1724. It is based on the hymn by Johannes Gigas (1561).\n\nBach composed the cantata in his second year in Leipzig for the Seventeenth Sunday after Trinity. That year, Bach composed a cycle of chorale cantatas, begun on the first Sunday after Trinity of 1724. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Ephesians, the admonition to keep the unity of the Spirit (Ephesians 4:1\u20136), and from the Gospel of Luke, healing a man with dropsy on the Sabbath (Luke 14:1\u201311). The cantata is based on a song of penitence in six stanzas by Johannes Gigas (1561), sung to the melody of \"Wo Gott der Herr nicht bei uns h\u00e4lt\". The hymn is only distantly related to the readings, concentrating on the thought that the Christians sin and deserve punishment, but may be raised to joy in a \"seliger Tod\" (blessed death). An unknown poet kept the first, third and sixth stanza as movements 1, 4 and 7 of the cantata. He derived movements 2 and 3, aria and recitative, from stanza 2, movement 5, another aria, from stanza 4, and the last recitative from stanza 5. In movement 3, he deviated from the song text, expanding in connection to the Gospel that sin in general is comparable to the dropsy, \"diese S\u00fcndenwassersucht ist zum Verderben da und wird dir t\u00f6dlich sein\" (this sinful dropsy leads to destruction and will be fatal to you), and alluding to Adam's fall, caused by self-exaltation in the forbidden quest to be like God, \"Der Hochmut a\u00df vordem von der verbotnen Frucht, Gott gleich zu werden\" (Pride first ate the forbidden fruit, to be like God).\n \nBach first performed the cantata on 1 October 1724, only two days after the first performance of his chorale cantata Herr Gott, dich loben alle wir, BWV 130, on the feast of Michael, the archangel, 29 September 1724.\n\nIn the opening chorale fantasia, Bach expresses two thoughts of the text, comfort and fear, by contrasting themes that appear simultaneously in the instruments: an assertive theme is derived from the melody and played by the two oboes and first violins, an \"anxious\" one in the second violins and the continuo. The soprano sings the melody as a cantus firmus, doubled by the horn, while the lower voices are set partly in expressive imitation, partly in homophony. They are treated differently to reflect the meaning of the text.\n \nThe first aria for alto with a virtuoso flute contrasts again the anxious question \"Wo wird in diesem Jammertale vor meinen Geist die Zuflucht sein?\" (Where can the refuge of my spirit be found in this valley of woe?) and the trusting \"Allein zu Jesu Vaterh\u00e4nden will ich mich in der Schwachheit wenden\" (Only to Jesus's paternal hands do I wish to turn in weakness), however, the question returns in the da capo form. The first recitative begins secco, but expresses the contrasting words \"erhebst\" (exalt) and \"erniedrigt\" (humbled) from the Gospel as an arioso. The chorale stanza is set for the soprano, accompanied only by the continuo. In its \"starkness of the unembellished chorale\" it is the centerpiece of the cantata. The alto aria is the only movement of the cantata in a major key. A shift to minor on the words \"Es mu\u00df ja so einmal gestorben sein\" (One day, indeed, one must die) is even more striking. The cantata ends with a four-part setting of the chorale melody.\n\nAlthough originally scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, horn to double the soprano, flauto traverso, two oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo, I created this arrangement for Solo Marimba & Tubular Bells.", "title": "Chorale: \"Kein Frucht das Weizenk\u00f6rnlein bringt\" (BWV 114 No 4) for Marimba & Tubular Bells", "publishedDate": "2014-11-21T20:46:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "4gozU2j7318", "description": "My brother Jon shooting my NEF Pardner 12ga pump shotgun at the range.

Suo malgrado, per\u00f2, ha una particolarit\u00e0 genetica unica che lo contraddistingue da tutti gli altri, \u00e8 difatti nato con l'occhio sinistro rosso; di solito il ragazzo si trova costretto a nascondere questa caratteristica dietro una lente a contatto.\nOra, quest'occhio cos\u00ec \"strano\" gli da di fatto la capacit\u00e0 di vedere ci\u00f2 che gli altri non riescono nemmeno ad intuire, ovvero spiriti e fantasmi; ci\u00f2 fin dall'inizio, com'\u00e8 facile immaginare, gli ha causato nella vita non poche difficolt\u00e0 di relazione. Ma anche se questa capacit\u00e0 speciale avrebbe potuto facilmente spaventare chiunque, non fa invece paura a Yakumo.\n\nIl nostro protagonista crede fortemente ed \u00e8 convinto che gli esseri ultraterreni che lui riesce ad intravedere non siano altro che grumi di sentimenti inespressi lasciati alle spalle dai loro legittimi proprietari e mai risolti: ci\u00f2 fa s\u00ec che l'autore di tali sentimenti, anche dopo morto, rimanga strettamente (anche al di l\u00e0 della sua volont\u00e0) collegato al mondo dei vivi e non riesca pertanto a distogliersene e liberarsi.\nParlando con loro Yakumo capisce che, se fosse in grado di eliminare la causa emotiva che costringe gli spiriti a rimaner attaccati al mondo, riuscirebbe conseguentemente anche a scioglierne i legami che li mantengono ancorati ai vivi, permettendogli cos\u00ec finalmente di riposare in pace.\n\nUn giorno una sua compagna di scuola di nome Haruka bussa alla sua porta, chiedendogli aiuto: crede che una sua cara amica sia stata posseduta dai demoni e lei non sa proprio cosa fare per poterla salvare. Dopo un primo momento di titubanza, Yakumo si decide ad accettare l'incarico: ha cos\u00ec inizio tutta una serie d'avventure ricche d'eventi soprannaturali irrisolti, in cui i due protagonisti cercano di decifrarne gli enigmi strettamente interconnessi l'uno con l'altro.\nIl viaggio indagatore di Yakumo ha inizio, nel tentativo di liberare il suo cuore dal peso di un dolorosissimo passato.", "title": "Psychic Detective Yakumo/Opening Sub ITA", "publishedDate": "2013-01-16T21:00:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "4gxSBIjrODY", "description": "From their first album, \"Good For The Country.\" Download it here: http://apps.facebook.com/marketpage/mu07n26dfwwupqoy6k0xj/browse?user=734463379", "title": "The Torpedoes - Interplanetary", "publishedDate": "2009-02-24T02:22:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "4gxSI6GOsD0", "description": "Hi, Dye the Safe Guy here to talk about the SG-450 Hydrosorbent dehumidifier.

The way this works is it has special silica gel crystals, really high quality, that absorb the moisture and maintain 65% relative humidity inside of your safe. For gun safes it keeps the barrels from pitting for shotguns and rifles. For regular safes it keeps paperwork from getting moldy or grandmas bible from getting deteriorated especially if it's an old bible. So we recommend a $25.00 dehumidifier for every 1 cubic foot to 33 cubic foot safe that you have. The nice thing about this it has on the bottom here, the blue dots. They turn red when the silica gel crystals are full of moisture. So you just take this. You put it in your oven for 3 hours at 250 degrees. It recharges them and everything is great. Silica gel is non-toxic, EPA approved and this $25.00 item has a lifetime warranty.

I'm Sonia and we're in the GialloZafferano kitchen to prepare a staple of Italian cuisine: Spaghetti Amatriciana. Let's see the ingredients we'll need:\n\u2022 14 oz of spaghetti or bucatini\n\u2022 Extra virgin olive oil\n\u2022 \u00bd glass of white wine\n\u2022 10 \u00bd oz of peeled tinned tomatoes \u2022 \u00bc cup of grated pecorino cheese\n\u2022 3 \u00bd oz of guanciale or bacon\n\u2022 1 chilli pepper\n\u2022 Pepper to taste\nLet's see how to make it.\nThe first thing is to boil a pot of water for the pasta. Then cut up your bacon into small strips or cubes -- whichever you'd prefer. Add a bit of oil to a pan, add the bacon and fry. Now you can add the chilli and cook until the fat of the bacon or guanciale becomes transparent. Then add the white wine and when it has evaporated a bit, turn off the heat. \nIt's time to add the wine.  Now I'll leave it to evaporate and after strain and remove the bacon from the pan leaving the fat and wine behind. \nI've removed the bacon from the pan and now  I'll cover it to keep it hot, and after that it's time to add the diced tomatoes to the liquid in the pan. The tomatoes should cook for about 10 minutes which is just enough time to cook our spaghetti.\nThe pasta is almost done. Now add the bacon back to the sauce, add half of the pecorino cheese, and then, we're ready to add the pasta. Mix the pasta and sauce together in the pan, add salt to taste if necessary and then your spaghetti Amatriciana is ready to be served. \nAfter you've plated up the spaghetti, sprinkle a bit of the reserved pecorino over the top.

The custom is of Scandinavian origin.[14]\n\nIn Norse mythology, Baldr was a god of vegetation. His mother Frigga, prompted by a prophetic dream, made every plant, animal and inanimate object promise not to harm him. But Frigga overlooked the mistletoe plant \u2014 and the mischievous god Loki took advantage of this oversight, tricking the blind god H\u00f6\u00f0r into killing Baldr with a spear fashioned from mistletoe. Baldr's death brought winter into the world, until the gods restored him to life. Frigga declared the mistletoe sacred, ordering that from now on it should bring love rather than death into the world. Happily complying with Frigga's wishes, any two people passing under the plant from now on would celebrate Baldr's resurrection by kissing under the mistletoe.\n Medicinal use\n\nAvailable clinical evidence does not support claims of anti-cancer effect for mistletoe extract; quality of life and other outcomes measures have likewise shown no or weak improvement in rigorous trials.\n\nMistletoe leaves and young twigs are used by herbalists, and it is popular in Europe, especially in Germany, for treating circulatory and respiratory system problems.An old Christian tradition said that mistletoe was once a tree and furnished the wood of the Cross. After the Crucifixion, the plant shriveled and became dwarfed to a parasitic vine.\n\nIn Romanian traditions, mistletoe (v\u00e2sc in Romanian) is considered a source of good fortune. The medical and the supposed magical properties of the plant are still used, especially in rural areas.\n\nA popular myth says that mistletoe was cut with a gold sickle and it lost its power if it fell and touched the ground. This is a confusion with the Holly 'holy' Tree, the most sacred tree of the druids (after the Oak) due to both plants being green all year, having colorful fruits and sharing similar history of winter months. Getafix, the druid in the Asterix comics, was often seen up trees collecting mistletoe for his magic potion.\nMistletoe is commonly used as a Christmas decoration, though such use was rarely alluded to until the 18th century.Viscum album is used in Europe whereas Phoradendron serotinum is used in North America. According to custom, the mistletoe must not touch the ground between its cutting and its removal as the last of Christmas greens at Candlemas; it may remain hanging through the year, often to preserve the house from lightning or fire, until it was replaced the following Christmas Eve.. The tradition has spread throughout the English-speaking world but is largely unknown in the rest of Europe. The appearance and nature of the fruit's content (viscin) is very similar to or suggestive of human semen and this has strengthened its pagan connections.Mistletoe (Phoradendron flavescens) is the state floral emblem for the state of Oklahoma. The state did not have an official flower, leaving mistletoe as the assumed state flower until the Oklahoma Rose was designated as such in 2004.\n# State floral emblem: Mistletoe\n# State flower: Oklahoma Rose\nOklahoma is the 28th most populous and 20th-largest state. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma, meaning \"red people\",[5] and is known informally by its nickname, The Sooner State. Formed by the combination of Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory on November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as Oklahomans, and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.Part of the Bible Belt, widespread belief in evangelical Christianity makes it one of the most politically conservative states, though Oklahoma has more voters registered with the Democratic Party than with any other party.[14]", "title": "Kissing!!~under the mistletoe~", "publishedDate": "2009-12-22T19:50:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "4h9OrXSDuSU", "description": "From the album, Nothing To Lose.

That condition is probably a little more common in women, but I see it in laborers, men as well as women.  It can be from heavy use on the job or heavy use doing things you enjoy like crafting or knitting.  It can be something that occurs quickly or is something that occurs over a long period of time.  \nAs far as treatment options for it, really it goes from the simple little to the more complex.  Things like anti-inflammatory medications, Motrin or Aleve can be utilized, Tylenol, over-the-counter medications, rubs, creams, this sometimes help.  When things like that do not help or in addition to those things bracing can sometimes help and the one common about a brace whether its from your doctor or from a pharmacy, is to make sure it includes the thumb itself, if it includes just the wrist and is cut out over the thumb that actually usually makes the arthritis hurt more.  \nSeeing your doctor usually makes sense when simple things like I have just mentioned do not work and sometimes your doctor can prescribe medications that are similar but may be more strong or he or she can inject Cortisone or an anti-inflammatory medication right into the joint and that can be pretty beneficial too.  I have personally seen injections last over a year, although most of the time it lasts about three months.  \nWhen bracing does not work, when medications do not work, when injections do not work, then surgery is something that seriously consider and the surgery to rebuild that joint works very well.  It is a type of joint replacement, but it does not utilize any artificial parts and it works very well after rehabilitation time of about three months or so.  \nPatients do well and their grip increases and their pain goes away.  Some patients are unfortunate enough where their arthritis is bad enough that their thumb starts to get deformed and the arthritis here causes the thumb bone to get stuck down and when that happens, this knuckle will start to bend backwards and when a patient starts to see that bending back or a zigzag deformity, that is time they really see a physician with a little more urgency.  It is not an emergency, but it is not something that you should leave alone for a long time because it makes reconstruction harder.  \nSo overall there are a lot of things that somebody can do for CMC or basilar joint arthritis.  Some of them are simple like over-the-counter medications or a brace.  Some of them are a little more complicated like an injection.  Now when those things stop working, reconstruction or rebuilding the joint works very well and the only time to get may be a little bit of urgency to see your physician is when the thumb goes into that collapsed or zigzag position.\n\nLearn more about Dr. Rick Papandrea: http://www.orthowisconsin.com/index.asp?menuID=181&firstlevelmenuID=137&siteID=1", "title": "Basilar Joint Arthritis, When To See Your Doctor", "publishedDate": "2012-11-07T20:38:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "4hRd8zj0KfQ", "description": "LaVern Baker (* 11.
