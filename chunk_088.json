H. L. Mencken called the Martini \"the only American invention as perfect as the sonnet\" and E. B. White called it \"the elixir of quietude\"\n\nThe exact origin of the Martini is unclear. Numerous cocktails with names and ingredients similar to the modern-day Martini were first seen in bartending guides of the late 19th century. For example, in the 1888 Bartender's Manual there was a recipe for a drink that consisted of half a wine glass of Old Tom Gin and a half a wine glass of vermouth. In 1863, an Italian vermouth maker started marketing their product under the brand name of Martini. This product is still available today, although it is now better known as Martini & Rossi.\n\nAnother popular theory suggests it evolved from a cocktail called the Martinez served at the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco sometime in the early 1860s, which people frequented before taking an evening ferry to the nearby town of Martinez. Alternatively, the people of Martinez say the drink was first created by a bartender in their town, or maybe the drink was named after the town. Another theory links the first dry martini to the name of a bartender who concocted the drink at the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City in 1911 or 1912.\n\nDuring Prohibition the relative ease of illegal gin manufacture led to the martini's rise as the predominant cocktail of the mid 20th century in the United States. With the repeal of Prohibition, and the ready availability of quality gin, the drink became progressively dryer. In the 1970s and 80s, the martini came to be seen as old-fashioned and was replaced by more intricate cocktails and wine spritzers, but the mid-1990s saw a resurgence in the drink and an explosion of new versions.\n\nSome newer drinks include the word \"Martini\" or the suffix \"-tini\" in the name (e.g., appletini, peach martini, chocolate martini, espresso martini). These are named after the Martini cocktail glass they use and generally contain vodka like the kangaroo cocktail, but share little else with the drink.", "title": "How to Make The Dirty Vodka Martini - Best Drink Recipes", "publishedDate": "2014-04-23T05:06:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "4WOk7UNAvOw", "description": "Music video by Pearl Jam performing Oceans.

Without him, I would be nowhere. He's given me the blessing to have the company and profound success, but to also be a motivation to others,\" he wrote.\n\nAccording to his profile on his company's website, young Bledsoe is an expert in start-up businesses, entrepreneurship, Venture Capital Funding and direct marketing platforms that target small and mid-sized businesses and caters to a global clientele.\n\n\"Over the last few years, I've been able to motivate that kid, who smokes weed all day, to go and learn about entrepreneurship; who plays video games all day, to go and learn how to develop his own video game; who's considered a nerd at school, and is bullied,\" the teenage businessman noted in the post.\n\n\"Often, my peers will say that I'm so lucky to do what I do, or how they wish they could do the same. Every time that I've heard this phrase, I get a sense of pride, knowing that I've had the opportunity to motive my peers,\" he said.\n\n\"Age is nothing but a number, don't let this prolong your dreams. Your past does not limit your future, but expands your knowledge on how to make your future great,\" he added citing a few motivational words. \"Success is not calculated on the amount of likes you receive on an Instagram picture, but is defined by the amount of internal pride created by your accomplishments. Find a skill of yours, and go master it!\"\n\nHis company profile states that he has been recognized for his academic excellence and leadership winning a \"Presidential Academic Excellence Award\" from President Barack Obama in 2009. He also received the \"Gateway Young Achiever of the Year\" and was selected as the second place winner for the Missouri Parent Teachers Association \"Diversity\" contest.\n\nHe currently attends Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School in Ladue, Mo., and plans to attend Harvard University to study business administration and computer science. \n\n\n\n\nDARK MATTER PARADIGM | http://www.darkmatterparadigm.blogspot.com\n\nThe mystery and history of the first peoples - The Indigenous, Original Moors.

The reason they're interested in that is because they want to see how much equity in your company they're going to get in return for a capital infusion, and they're going to go about that in several different ways.\n\nOne method that they're going to commonly use, though, is what's called the price-to-earnings ratio. And what the price-to-earnings ratio is is it's, quite simply, the price of your stock divided by the earnings per share of your stock over a 12-month period. For example, let's say Company A's stock price is $20, and let's say the most recent annual earnings for Company A was $2 per share. The price-to-earnings ratio of Company A is 10. Now, the way our investors are going to use this information is, they're going to go out, and they're going to do some research on publicly traded companies in your market space, and they're going to look at an average of price-to-earnings ratios across those companies, and they're going to arrive at what this industry can support, and then they're going to make some determinations about how long it's going to take you to achieve sufficient revenue and sufficient earnings to execute an exit plan, and they're going to make some assumptions about what the stock markets at that point and time are going to have an appetite for in terms of public offerings or sales, and they're going to accordingly assign a price-to-earnings ratio to your company. And it's also important for you to understand this, because what you want to do is, you want to do your own homework so that you can go and, when the time comes, negotiate with the investors and really be prepared to defend the value of your company, because, after all, you're going to be giving up a portion of your equity in your company in exchange for the cash infusion.\n\nAnd if you think you need help, get in touch with us at the Capital MatchPoint .

They visit each house in the locality playing music,dancing,singing and reciting poems. The style of set dancing in Clare is symbolised by the \"battering\" or foot tapping that goes on in time with the music.  This clip was taken when set dancing  was neither profitable or popular. Every time I look at this video it raises my heart another few beats.  I love it!\n\n In Ireland, St. Stephen's Day is the day for \"Hunting the Wren\" or \"Going on the Wren.\" Originally, groups of small boys would hunt for a wren, and then chase the bird until they either have caught it or it has died from exhaustion. The dead bird was tied to the top of a pole or holly bush, which was decorated with ribbons or colored paper.\n\nEarly in the morning of St. Stephen's Day, the wren was carried from house to house by the boys, who wore straw masks or blackened their faces with burnt cork, and dressed in old clothes. At each house, the boys sing the Wren Boys' song. Such as:\n\nThe wren, the wren, the king of all birds,\nOn St. Stephen's Day was caught in the furze,\nAlthough he is little, his family is great,\nI pray you, good landlady, give us a treat.\n\nMy box would speak, if it had but a tongue,\nAnd two or three shillings, would do it not wrong,\nSing holly, sing ivy--sing ivy, sing holly,\nA drop just to drink, it would drown melancholy.\n\nAnd if you draw it of the best,\nI hope in heaven your soul will rest;\nBut if you draw it of the small,\nIt won't agree with these wren boys at all.\n\nSometimes those who gave money were given a feather from the wren for good luck. The money collected by the Wren Boys was used to hold a dance for the whole village.\n\nThere are different legends about the origin of this custom. One is that St. Stephen, hiding from his enemies in a bush, was betrayed by a chattering wren. The wren, like St. Stephen, should be hunted down and stoned to death. Another legend holds that during the Viking raids of the 700's, Irish soldiers were betrayed by a wren as they were sneaking up on a Viking camp in the dead of night. A wren began to eat breadcrumbs left on the head of a drum, and the rat-a-tat-tat of its beak woke the drummer, who sounded the alarm and woke the camp, leading to the defeat of the Irish soldiers and the continuing persecution of the wren.", "title": "The West Clare Wrenboys", "publishedDate": "2006-12-28T16:16:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "4WvnjCkLbvY", "description": "I was doing some research for Cobra parfum by Jeannes Arthes and came across this video about snake venom by mistake - it's so incredible that I just had to upload it to YouTube.

American Soprano Angela Ah\u0131skal and Turkish pianist Tayfun \u0130lhan performed works by Arnold Schoenberg, Leonard Bernstein, Eric Satie and O. Resphighi.  Their performance was warmly received by an audience of diplomats, musicians, and leaders of the arts community.\n\nFrom the program notes:\n\"WHIMSY ...\nLovers' fickleness, faeries on the wing, a child's capriciousness -- they all may change direction like smoke in the wind. This is the whimsical world of dreams. Tonight's program was conceived with this notion in mind. The pieces themselves conjure images of dreams or fanciful circumstances. But in addition, the nature of each set is very different from the others -- a continual shifting from one reflection to the next, as our whims so often do.\"\n      \nANGELA AHISKAL\nA graduate of the performance program at the University at Buffalo, American soprano Angela Ah\u0131skal continued her Masters studies at the Hartt School in Connecticut. Recipient of several awards in Buffalo, Ah\u0131skal was also the advanced division winner of the 2003 NATS competition in Connecticut. A director and a founding member of the University at Buffalo's a cappella ensemble the Royal Pitches between 1997 and 2001, she recorded and produced three albums with the ensemble. Ah\u0131skal also directed, staged and sang in the project Da Capo: A Buffalo Debut. Ah\u0131skal has sung roles with ensembles including the Connecticut Lyric Opera, the Simsbury Light Opera Company and the Connecticut Concert Opera in such productions as Bizet's Carmen, Gilbert and Sullivan's The Sorcerer, and Handel's oratorio Joshua. Her choral experience includes performances with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra and as soloist with the Cheektowaga Orchestra and the Orchard Park Chorale. Equally at home on the concert stage and performing in numerous ensemble and solo recitals, she partnered with Peruvian conductor-pianist Pablo Sabat in a series of recitals of French, German, Italian, and American art song repertoire. Living in Turkey since 2005, Ah\u0131skal headed the founding of the Voice Department at Akdeniz University Antalya State Conservatory. While in Antalya she gave recitals such as Spring Fever and appeared as soloist with Ah\u0131skal Baroque Ensemble led by her husband, Orhan Ah\u0131skal, in Baroktan Esintiler. Ah\u0131skal moved to Ankara in 2011 and in the 2012--2013 season she has given recitals in venues such as the Ankara. \n\nPresidential Symphony Hall and Ergin Orbey Hall in Eski\u015fehir. This season, she will be performing with the Eski\u015fehir Municipal and Bilkent Symphony Orchestras, as well as giving recitals in Ankara, \u0130stanbul, and Konya. Ah\u0131skal is currently on the Opera Department Voice Faculty of the Ankara University State Conservatory.\nTAYFUN \u0130LHAN\nBorn in \u0130zmir in 1987, Tayfun \u0130lhan began studying music privately at the age of 12. In 2001 he was accepted to I\u015f\u0131lay Sayg\u0131n Anatolian Fine Arts High School and continued studying privately with Professor Dr. Nergiz \u015eakirzade Sar\u0131. \u0130lhan became a student at Bilkent University Faculty of Music and Performing Arts in 2005, where he studied with Associate Professor Hande Dalk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7. In 2011, he graduated with honors. During his studies he gave many recitals and chamber music concerts and also made several radio recordings.

Schools (n = 24) were randomized into intervention and control conditions; 2904 children were studied from end of second to fifth grade. Students at schools assigned to the RC condition did not outperform students at schools assigned to the control condition in math or reading achievement. Use of RC practices mediated the relation between treatment assignment and improved math and reading achievement. Effect sizes (ES) were calculated as standardized coefficients. ES relations between use of RC practices and achievement were .26 for math and .30 for reading. The RC practices and math achievement relation was greater for students with low initial math achievement (ES = .89).

However, the identity of the perpetrators of the attack, which took place in July 2012, has yet been revealed. Just hours after the event, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Lebanon's resistance movement Hezbollah for the attack and Canada presupposed the veracity of Tel Aviv's claim. But Israel's interpretation has been brought into question by Bulgaria's newly formed Socialist government which has drawn attention to the lack of evidence proving Hezbollah is responsible.\n\nCanada's government and media in unison told the Canadian public that members of Hezbollah, one of whom they said was a Canadian citizen, were responsible for the Bulgaria attacks, in spite of the lack of credible evidence to support this claim. And based on this unsubstantiated assertion, Canada's ruling eoconservatives were able to ram several draconian anti-terror laws through parliament. \n\nA treasonous government. Harper has come out and put the interests of Israel before the interests of Canadians. So it is in the vested interest of Harper and kin to actually put forth a pro-Israeli agenda. And for that to happen they need to make false claims and they've made a false claim about Hezbollah being involved in the Bulgaria incident when the Bulgarian authorities themselves have said that there is not even evidence. This Bulgarian act possibly could be a false-flag. \n\nThe Foreign Minister for Bulgaria's newly formed Socialist government stated during a recent interview: \"The evidence is not categorical. . .we can't take such a heavy decision with serious implications for the policy of the entire European Union on the basis of circumstantial evidence.\" Some Canadians note that the kind of debate that is being witnessed in Europe over the culpability for the Bulgaria attacks was absent in Canada where the media and politicians all acted as if was indisputable that Hezbollah was to blame. \n\nWell the reason why there is a debate I think in the EU is because there is actually some progressives in the EU parliament. There's some progressives is that some of the countries of the EU. Whereas here in Canada we have a right-wing, quasi-fascist, pro-Zionist government in Ottawa and that is backed up by a pro-Zionist, pro-right wing media establishment. So that is the difference between us being \"yes they're terrorists\" and having that debate in Europe. \n\nPro-Israel groups have been exerting pressure on Bulgaria's government to support listing Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. This is not the first international terrorist incident, which Israel blamed on its adversaries without credible evidence. It is while critics note that Israel is the main beneficiary of international terrorist incidents as they serve to align foreign governments with Israeli geopolitical priorities.", "title": "Bulgarian Govt Raises Doubts About Hezbollah Involvement in Bulgaria Attacks - PRESS TV", "publishedDate": "2013-06-22T19:10:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "4XJCcIwsh5g", "description": "Cirrus clopuds.", "title": "Cirrostratus, cirus spissatus virga 7.02. 2009.", "publishedDate": "2009-02-07T14:47:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "4XJSorBTouw", "description": "to get a newholland tractor to pull this machine it takes a 285 hp tractor but for a john deere it only takes 180 hp.", "title": "john deere 7830 pullin a 12 row ripper bedder.", "publishedDate": "2010-10-22T04:44:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4XJd88cTRsU", "description": "Digital Reconstruction of Knossos Palace Reconstruction Crete\n\nMy other work and website can be found at: http://greenergames.net/\n\nCreated for love not money, hopefully those of you that are intrigued with its history or have visited the palace will find it interesting.\n\nPlease overlook the overused audio track, this is bound to annoy the easily irritated.

La tarea no ser\u00e1 f\u00e1cil, pero s\u00ed que ser\u00e1 interesante.\nDe acuerdo a los montos de inversi\u00f3n anunciados por Nino Boggio, gerente legal de la empresa, la apuesta ha sido duplicar la capacidad instalada que recibieron al comprar Nextel y mantenerse en dicho ritmo (US$250 millones por a\u00f1o) de inversiones por varios a\u00f1os.\nBoggio detall\u00f3 que, hasta fines del 2014, habr\u00e1n invertido US$1.000 millones, lo cual incluye la compra de la operaci\u00f3n de Nextel en el Per\u00fa, la compra de la banda 4G e inversiones orientadas a ampliar la cobertura de la red para poder usar las tecnolog\u00edas 2G, 3G, y 4G.\nEso significa que ahora est\u00e1n listos para el doble de participaci\u00f3n (8%) en su primer a\u00f1o y que planean seguir a ese ritmo por varios a\u00f1os hasta lograr el ambicioso objetivo de acaparar el 30% del mercado, es decir, la tercera parte, con Movistar y Claro como competidores de igual a igual.\nNo los vimos nerviosos, ni asustados, ni temerosos. Est\u00e1n decididos, desafiantes, delirantemente dispuestos a tener casi diez veces m\u00e1s lo que manejan hoy en d\u00eda en muy poco tiempo. Han dise\u00f1ado la estrategia y lucen decididos a no darse por vencidos.\nEs una carrera para maratonistas de alto alcance, de esos que superan los 100 km de un tir\u00f3n, pero est\u00e1n dispuestos a llegar a la meta.\n\u00bfTendremos al fin un mercado equilibrado con tres actores fuertes disputando un tercio de la torta? El tiempo lo dir\u00e1. Por lo pronto se les ve armados, decididos, dispuestos y con todas las ganas.\nHabr\u00e1 que ver si el mercado responde a la nueva marca, si la oferta de productos es la apropiada en precios y si su promesa de esforzarse al m\u00e1ximo por la calidad en servicio y la experiencia satisfactoria se convierten en realidad.

Composed largely at a remote cottage in Wales known as Bron-Yr-Aur, this work represented a maturing of the band's music towards a greater emphasis on folk and acoustic sounds. This surprised many fans and critics, and upon its release the album received rather indifferent reviews.\n\nAlthough it is not one of the highest sellers in Zeppelin's catalogue, Led Zeppelin III is now generally praised, and acknowledged as representing an important milestone in the band's history. Although acoustic songs are featured on Led Zeppelin III's predecessors, it is this album which is widely acknowledged for showing that Led Zeppelin was more than just a conventional rock band and that they could branch out in other areas musically.\n\nLine-Up:\n\nJimmy Page -- acoustic, electric and pedal steel guitar, backing vocals, banjo, dulcimer, bass guitar on \"That's the Way\"\nRobert Plant -- lead vocals, harmonica\nJohn Bonham -- drums, percussion, backing vocals\nJohn Paul Jones -- bass guitar, organ, synthesizer, mandolin, backing vocals\n\nUploaded with FREESTUDIO\n\nby: Bashkim \"KIMI\" Mujovi", "title": "Led Zeppelin - Tangerine", "publishedDate": "2011-09-19T23:36:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "4XdS9_j7-hE", "description": "EMAC Class for the Idiom \"Pulling your leg\"", "title": "Pulling Your Leg", "publishedDate": "2012-10-23T18:44:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "4XdeYUw6z6M", "description": "Visit and like The Bad Religion Page on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Bad-Religion-Page/184941001566549", "title": "Bad Religion - Quality Or Quantity (Demo) 1990", "publishedDate": "2012-08-31T19:22:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Xe47k4UMSo", "description": "", "title": "Klaus Cornfield & Friedemann", "publishedDate": "2014-01-15T20:54:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "4XeQxbKI2oY", "description": "chanty starrs lecherousness caparisoned embolden haemophilia taillessness ogdoad siegecraft vina soddening heftiness omnified lesions starrs puzzledom haverel strutters urbanize owners courteously skywriting deathward meanness pronounced clerkly discourteously weans radiator lecherousness approaches tambourins eurythmies cabalist unmasks screams dioramic agnamed misdraw clippers hylozoist folia unmoored halteres apprehend messenger synonymist\n\ngesture,impound,cobblestones,carport,sloshing,woodbinds,slurries,undercurrents,radiometer,actionable,fescues", "title": "halteres apprehend messenger synonymist", "publishedDate": "2012-06-21T11:06:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "4XedU4QjJvI", "description": "CHEAP GAMES & XBOX LIVE CODES: http://bit.ly/10FHAsL\nCODE ECKO FOR 3% OFF AT CHECKOUT!\n\n\u25ba Subscribe For More Videos: http://bit.ly/GAUU7B  \n\u25ba Other Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/InMyyLife\n\u25ba Instagram:  http://instagram.com/scott_t16\n\u25ba Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/#!/EcKoxSoldier\n\u25ba Facebook Page: http://on.fb.me/16w7Q9T \n\u25ba Twitch.tv: http://www.twitch.tv/eckoxsoldier\n\u25ba Google +: https://plus.google.com/+XxEcKoxSoldierxX\n\u25ba Intro Song: passion pit - take a walk\n\u25ba My Server: MC.ECKOXCRAFT.COM\n\u25ba Server Store: http://store.eckoxcraft.com/\n\u25ba Website: http://eckoxcraft.com/   \n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nSo alot of people have asked me this week if we are getting a new tutorial mode for the Minecraft title update 19 update.

These two Monitor Lizards make a very nice couple!\n\nMonitor lizards are generally large reptiles, although some can be as small as 20 centimetres (7.9 in) in length. They have long necks, powerful tails and claws, and well-developed limbs. Most species are terrestrial, but arboreal and semiaquatic monitors are also known. Almost all monitor lizards are carnivorous, although Varanus bitatawa, Varanus mabitang and Varanus olivaceus are also known to eat fruit. They are oviparous, laying from seven to 37 eggs, which they often cover with soil or protect in a hollow tree stump.\n\nMonitor lizards differ greatly from other lizards in several ways, possessing a relatively high metabolic rate for reptiles, and several sensory adaptations that benefit the hunting of live prey. Recent research indicates the varanid lizards may have some venom.This discovery of venom in monitor lizards, as well as in agamid lizards, led to the Toxicofera hypothesis: that all venomous lizards and snakes share a common venomous ancestor.\nDuring the late Cretaceous era, monitor lizards or their close relatives are believed to have evolved into amphibious and then fully marine forms, the mosasaurs, which reached lengths of up to 17 m.\n\nSnakes were believed to be more closely related to monitor lizards than any other type of extant reptile, however, it has been more recently proposed that snakes are the sister group of the clade of iguanians and anguimorphs.\nDuring the Pleistocene epoch, giant monitor lizards lived in Southeast Asia and Australasia, the best known fossil being the megalania (Varanus priscus unless it falls in its own genus, in which case it is Megalania prisca). This species is an iconic member of the Pleistocene megafauna of Australia.\nSome monitor lizards, including the Komodo dragon, are capable of parthenogenesis.\n\nMonitor lizards have become a staple in the reptile pet trade. The most commonly kept monitors are the savannah monitor and Ackies monitor, due to their relatively small size, low cost, and relatively calm dispositions with regular handling. Black throated monitors, white throated monitors, water monitors, Nile monitors, mangrove monitors, emerald tree monitors, black tree monitors, acanthurus monitors, quince monitors, crocodile monitors and Komodo dragons have been kept in captivity.Like all reptiles kept as pets, monitors need an appropriately sized enclosure, hiding places, and an appropriate substrate.Some water monitors also need a large water dish in which they can soak their entire bodies.In the wild, monitors will eat anything they can overpower, but crickets, superworms, feeder fish, and the occasional rodent (for calcium) make up most of the smaller captive monitors' diet. Boiled eggs, silkworms and earthworms can also be fed to them. Larger species, such as Nile monitors, Asian water monitors, crocodile monitors, perenties, and Komodo dragons will eventually require larger prey. Paleontologist and biology professor at Temple University, Michael Balsai has observed V. prasinus eating fruit in captivity as has herpetologist and author, Robert G.

It's easy to put together coffee table decorations that are beautiful and complement your overall home decor. The spot is also perfect to showcase your treasures and favorite things. \n\nFor gorgeous coffee table decor, choose an eclectic mix of accessories and an interesting table. Here, we've chosen the Connor Coffee Table with a limestone top. You can place two besides each other for visual balance.\n\nTrays make excellent coffee table decorations as they can be used to corral smaller items like votives. Add votives in different shapes and sizes in the tray. It's a good idea to choose votives made from different materials like mercury glass and metal for visual contrast. We have flameless wax candles that are perfect for illuminating your coffee table safely. The shiny decorative accessories also present an interesting contrast with the limestone tabletop.\n\nA favorite thing such as a beaded necklace can also be a part of your coffee table decor. Such coffee table decorations are a great choice as they serve as conversation starters when guests come over. For the other table, we've chosen candle holders in different sizes. Other simple and beautiful coffee table decorations include decorative boxes. Stack them from large to small for aesthetic appeal. These boxes can have a functional purpose. Use them to store remotes, coasters and other essentials.\n\nAdd a personal touch to the table decor with favorite photos and vacation pictures. A shallow stone bowl is perfect for holding these photos. Tuck away large coffee table books or blankets underneath the table to complete the look of your coffee table.\n\nTo know more, visit: www.potterybarn.com\n\nHere is the coffee table featured in this video: http://www.potterybarn.com/products/conner-wood-stone-square-coffee-table/\n\nUse these flameless votives to illuminate your coffee table: http://www.potterybarn.com/products/flameless-votive-candle/\n\nThese dough bowls can be used to corral candles and other decorative accents on the table: http://www.potterybarn.com/products/found-dough-bowls/\n\nThese vintage keys are perfect for interesting table decor: http://www.potterybarn.com/products/vintage-keys-set/\n\nHere are some ideas about how to decorate your living room: http://www.potterybarn.com/design-studio/decorate/living_rooms.html", "title": "Easy Coffee Table Decor Ideas | Pottery Barn", "publishedDate": "2014-07-14T22:10:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Xr9ELZSOnc", "description": "Www.intervalstudios.com\nWww.morganpackard.com", "title": "The great Thicket iPad app by Joshue Ott and Morgan Packard", "publishedDate": "2010-07-14T22:28:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "4XraIe-EbkI", "description": "DE PARTE DE \"C\u00a5B\u20ac\u00ae\" DE LA \"ZONA 7 KPAKACHI\" PARA TODOS LOS DE LA CALLE", "title": "sonido superior  DE LA CALLE Pedro Coca rap SOMOS DE CALLE", "publishedDate": "2012-07-12T11:01:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Xrv6jpTImE", "description": "Here is a time lapse of me transforming myself into the Cheshire Cat from American McGee's Alice: Madness Returns.

The monument became the starting point of the future museum, which was created with the express purpose to cultivate and promote the local study of archaeology and art. Indeed Trieste, thanks to its geographical position and its maritime trade, was able to attract items from the classical lands, from Egypt, and from places as far as Mesoamerica. The aim of acquiring such artefacts was to provoke in the locals a love of beauty, to attract foreign experts as well as to educate local artists and craftsmen.\nThe 'Orto Lapidario' houses ancient Roman exhibits from Aquileia, the Istria peninsula and Tergeste. These form a vast array of ancient sepulchral, honorary and sacred epigraphy from between the 1st and 5th centuries AD. \nIn the little temple lies the monument to Winckelmann, a neoclassical work by sculptor Antonio Bosa, which is surrounded by Greek and Roman classical sculptures. These exhibits represent the oldest core of the city's collections, which at the end of the 18th century belonged to the 'Accademia degli Arcadi Sonziaci'. \nThe garden opposite the museum building, surrounded by a wall with towers, and dating back to the 1400s and 1500s, houses mediaeval and modern items from the city.\nIn the Museum one can retrace the pre-history of the Karst plateau around Trieste from 80,000 years ago through items found in the caves and similar shelters found in the rocks. \nPottery, arms and personal ornaments from the Bronze and Iron Ages come from settlements called 'castellieri', and their respective necropoles, one of which - the one from Santa Lucia di Tolmino - stands out with its more than 7,000 tombs complete with grave goods. \nThere is a vast Roman collection from Aquileia, enriched by additional items found either locally or around the Mediterranean basin. These include sculptures and objects of daily use, imperial and private portraits, statuettes and bronze deities and a rich series of bronze, ceramic, glass, amber and bone artefacts, deriving mainly from dwellings and graves.\nThe Greek section displays a vast repertoire of Attic and Magna Graecia pottery, providing an historical overview that ranges from the Archaic to the whole of the Hellenistic periods. These items are noteworthy in terms of quantity, size, beauty and originality. The finds from the Taranto excavation site are especially interesting: reliefs and terracotta figures, antefixes and vases. And the impressive embossed silver rhyton: a ritual vase in the shape of a fawn's head made in around 400 BC - this is the museum's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance.\nFinally, a smaller room houses the \"Collezione Fabietti\" from El Salvador. This includes vases, instruments, and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic terracotta figurines, illustrating the traditions of a farming community which lived in contact with the great Mayan culture between 600 and 1,000 AD. \n\nComune di Trieste\nVideo by TCD\nWith the contribute of Friuli Venezia Giulia", "title": "Civico Museo di Storia ed Arte - Orto Lapidario - Trieste [ENG]", "publishedDate": "2013-08-23T12:30:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Y-vRk5B2i0", "description": "Having an ECG done.

The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes -- they form an evolutionary grade.[2] While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.\n\nLizards typically have feet and external ears, while snakes lack both of these characteristics. However, because they are defined negatively as excluding snakes, lizards have no unique distinguishing characteristic as a group. Lizards and snakes share a movable quadrate bone, distinguishing them from the sphenodonts, which have more primitive and solid diapsid skulls. Many lizards can detach their tails to escape from predators, an act called autotomy. Vision, including color vision, is particularly well developed in most lizards, and most communicate with body language or bright colors on their bodies, as well as with pheromones.\n\nThe adult length of species within the suborder ranges from a few centimeters for chameleons such as Brookesia micra and geckos such as Sphaerodactylus ariasae to nearly 3 m (9.8 ft) in the case of the largest living varanid lizard, the Komodo dragon. Some extinct varanids reached great size.

On Wednesday (14 February) gunmen stormed the U.S. embassy and attacked several television stations. SYNOPSIS: There's confusion about the identity of the armed civilians who attacked the embassy. The United States State Department claims the guerrillas were left-wingers opposed to the creation of an Islamic republic by the Ayatollah Khomeiny. Soviet television however has claimed that the raid was carried out by former agents of SAVAK, the Shah's secret police force and was designed to provide an excuse for United States military intervention in the Iranian crisis. A Soviet commentators linked the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) with the attack on the embassy. The U.S. State Department says that one Iranian employee at the embassy was killed and two American marines were wounded. U.S. Ambassador William Sullivan gave the order to surrender after exchanges of fire between U.S. marines and the guerrilla, but only after staff had burned essential documents and destroyed a decoding machine. The new Iranian government intervened in the attack on the embassy. Government militia men indistinguishable from the street mobs raced to the embassy and dispersed the attackers. Embassy staff emerged from their buildings after being held captive for nearly two hours. One of the guerrillas who had attacked the embassy explained why. Ambassador William Sullivan told how the embassy was attacked. Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan and the members of his cabinet are appealing for moderation by their armed supporters in the streets. And appealing for the followers of the Ayatollah Khomeiny to give up their arms.

Created for the 2007 InConJunction Science Fiction & Fantasy Convention, in Indianapolis, IN\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: Are these for real?\nA: Yes. The Wilhelm Scream exists in EVERY ONE of these movies (as released on DVD) and at the spot they are shown in these clips. It was NOT \"dropped in\" to any of the clips. The volume on some of the clips has been \"pumped up\" to make them more obvious.\n\nQ: How did you find them all?\nA: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_scream http://www.imdb.com/keyword/wilhelm-scream http://www.hollywoodlostandfound.net/wilhelm.html http://www.amazon.com/movies-famous-Wilhelm-Scream/lm/34PM7A6RLMQ5O and http://www.themadmusicarchive.com/song_details.aspx?SongID=20887\n\nQ: Is this the complete Wilhelm Scream list?\nA: OH HELL NO! Way too many movies, and I don't own them all on DVD.\n\nQ: Why didn't you include more clips from the original Academy Awards Wilhelm Scream compilation?\nA: Two reasons, first I don't own some of those movies on DVD, and my intent was to include very few duplicates.\n\nQ: What's the song at the end?\nA: \"That Calls For A Wilhelm Scream\", by Possible Oscar... they rock by the way.\n\nQ: What's \"The Wilhelm Game\"?\nA: While sitting in the theater and you hear a Wilhelm Scream, you shout out \"Wilhelm!\". Hopefully you won't get kicked out.\n\nQ: What's the Clip at 1:10?\nA: Hell Boy\n\nQ: What's the Clip at 1:33\nA: Sin City\n\nQ: What's the Clip at 1:52\nA: Howard The Duck\n\nQ: What's the clip at 2:06?\nA: Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nQ: What's the clip at 2:15?\nA: The Star Wars Holiday Special.\n\nQ: What's the clip at 2:22?\nA: King Kong (AKA, King Kong vs Jack Black).\n\nQ: What's the clip at 2:43?\nA: Curse of the Were-Rabbit\n\nQ: What's the clip at yadda yadda yadda...\nA: Really?

The five faces of Lord Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Maheshwara and Sadasiva, are seen as Panchagiri and as Panchalingas pertaining to the panchabhutas, in Velliangiri. The hill ranges have abundant natural resources, which include rare herbs. Lord Panchalingesa and his Consort Manonmani Amman alias Parvathi, bestow their grace on the devotees who throng here annually between February and May. \n\nFestivals: \nA unique feature of Dakshina Kailash is the annadhanam organised by the Arya Vaisya jewellers for the past two centuries, for four days during Mahasivaratri.

She is a direct descendant of Avarosa - one of three legendary sisters who each claimed dominion over the scattered tribes dwelling in the icy tundra of northern Valoran. Ashe mirrors her ancestor's unparalleled mastery of the bow, earning her the title of ''The Frost Archer'' the way Avarosa did during her era. Ashe is a literal Princess amongst her people, though she prefers to be addressed by outsiders as her tribal title rather than any form of royal moniker. There are those in Freljord, however, that would prefer to address Ashe as the ''late'' Frost Archer; the other two tribes that are descendants from the Three Sisters are historically sworn enemies of Ashe and her people. Having survived more than one assassination attempt in her life, Ashe is always aware of her surroundings regardless of where she is.\n\nAshe originally came to the Institute of War in service of the League summoners, seeking enough influence and favor to finally bring peace to her realm - one that has endured civil strife since Avarosa and the Time of the Three Sisters. With countless victories under her belt, she has started to put the influence she has earned in the League to use. Rumors abound that Ashe has begun to associate herself with fellow champion Tryndamere outside of the Fields of Justice. While she denies such talk as frivolous, all eyes will remain on Ashe now that her success in the League may finally allow her to restore lasting peace to her people.\n\n''It's a good idea to spread out.

Sequential activation of caspases plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes which undergo proteolytic processing by upstream caspases (caspase-8, -9)at conserved aspartic residues to produce two subunits, large and small, that dimerize to form the active enzyme in the form of a heterotetramer. The precursor of this caspase is cleaved by caspase 3, caspase 10, and caspase 9. It is activated upon cell death stimuli and induces apoptosis. Alternative splicing results in four transcript variants, encoding three distinct isoforms.\nDesign & production: Kosi Gramatikoff, PhD", "title": "Apoptosis and Caspase-7 [Ch1], Rate My Science", "publishedDate": "2008-11-02T21:55:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "4YZ5GMxeJlU", "description": "", "title": "david katanov RAFI BORUHOV NOW DOYRA no1", "publishedDate": "2009-06-25T13:13:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "4YZFOoEcHzg", "description": "please like and share \nmessed up a bit sorry :/\n\nDownload The Cover for free here: https://soundcloud.com/lizzy-farrall/community-stability-identity-gnarwolves-cover", "title": "Community, Stability, Identity - Gnarwolves (acoustic Cover)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-21T15:22:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Y_Ib1hixfY", "description": "EP: Straight Outta Long Beach\n\nLike a fist flung to a bloody face\nWe'll hit hard we'll win their race\nWon't give in won't be a lie\nKnock us down we'll never die\n\n[Chorus]\nCause it's a fight to survive\nThat keeps us alive\nIt's a fight to surivive\nIn our struggle we'll thrive\n\nLike warriors to a battlefield\nTo no other fist will we yield\nThis fight's been hard, this fight's been long\nBut bruised and scarred we're going strong\n\nGaining courage as we gain from defeat\nDon't plead for forgiveness as you take a beat\n\nStruggling everyday in our daily life\nAs we live in a world so full of strife\nMake it to tomorrow, we can never really know\nBut I'll hold my head high just to show", "title": "Strength Thru Struggle - Clit 45", "publishedDate": "2013-01-08T03:56:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Y_L8pnDRvY", "description": "http://www.A3Network.com.

Gold's brilliant prose teases us into the mysteries of other dimensions in the accomplished manner of a true adept\" --Jose Arguelles\n\n\"E.J. Gold. Gold is someone who has the rightsense of humor.\" -- Robert S. de Ropp\n\n\"The world of E.J. Gold transcends the wisdom of Buddha, the literary genius of Shakespeare, the artistic talent of Picasso, the humor of Will Rogers, and thoroughly homogenizes this transcendency with the mystical rays of the ethereal cosmos.\" \u2014Dr JR\n\n\"No comment.\" -- J. Edgar Hoover.\n\n\"E.J. Gold is a true voyager in the heroic tradition, always keeping the highest aims and the purest ethics close to his heart throughout his explorations.\" -- Iven Lourie\n\n\"E.J. Gold offers a rich feast. With finger poking us to wake up and pointing the way, he is a timeless translator for a lasting tradition in a clear and potent format.\" -- Dan Millman\n\n\"There is nobody that I know that I associate so much with the 'devious guide' (kash mir) . . . I have come to appreciate E.J. Gold as something much rarer than as an information disseminator: (He is) a teacher who does something through his communications and stands behind his statements.\" -- Dr. Claudio Naranjo\n\nAuthor E.J. Gold says about SlimeWars:\nMy 350,000 word 740 page novel loosely based on my life story -- SlimeWars -- written some 22 years ago and never published, has finally found a co-publisher.\n\nSlimeWars is intended to be read aloud in groups. It has a special purpose, of stimulating various parts of lower and higher centers, from the moving/instinctive all the way to the highest essential centers, in chordal groupings and multi-level responsive interactions, in much the same way as the interwoven parts of an orchestral work would function for the stimulation of various parts of psycho-emotional and sometimes spiritual centers.\n\nIt also happens to be extremely funny, I'm told. The amusing aspect is that spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down; it's there to make the book fun to read, but is not the primary intention.\n\nThis book is NOT for the public. It is not, and was never, intended for public release. It is being offered to you with the understanding that you will use it for its primary purpose, that of awakening and activating the full spectrum of lower to higher psycho-emotional to spiritual centers in the reader and listeners.\n\nYours in The Work, ej gold\n\nReports from groups reading SlimeWars:\nThis is an amazing book. I really look forward to our weekly readings. The space surrounding us during that time is extraordinary ... and the story is fascinating, too. -- V.J., Grass Valley, CA\n\nAnother meeting has come and gone like the days that fleet past us.

Service is best known for his poems \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" and \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\", from his first book, Songs of a Sourdough (1907; also published as The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses). \"These humorous tales in verse were considered doggerel by the literary set, yet remain extremely popular to this day.\" Robert W. Service was born in Preston, Lancashire, England, the first of ten children. His father, also Robert Service, was a banker from Kilwinning, Scotland, who had been transferred to England. At five years old Robert W. Service went to live in Kilwinning with his three maiden aunts and his paternal grandfather, who was the town's postmaster. There he is said to have composed his first verse, a grace, on his sixth birthday: \"God bless the cakes and bless the jam; Bless the cheese and the cold boiled ham; Bless the scones Aunt Jeannie makes, And save us all from bellyaches. Amen\"\n\nIn 1913, Service arrived in Paris, where he would live for the next 15 years. He settled in the Latin Quarter, posing as a painter. In June 1913, he married Parisienne Germaine Bourgoin, daughter of a distillery owner, and they purchased a summer home at Lancieux, C\u00f4tes-d'Armor, in the Brittany region of France. Thirteen years younger than her husband, Germaine Service lived 31 years following his death, dying at age 102 in 1989. Robert Service was 41 when World War I broke out; he enlisted, but was turned down \"due to varicose veins.\" He briefly covered the war for the Toronto Star (from December 11, 1915 through January 29, 1916), but \"was arrested and nearly executed in an outbreak of spy hysteria in Dunkirk.\" -- then \"worked as a stretcher bearer and ambulance driver with the Ambulance Corps of the American Red Cross, until his health broke.\" Convalescing in Paris, he wrote a new book of mainly war poetry, Rhymes of a Red Cross Man, in 1916. The book was dedicated to the memory of Service's \"brother, Lieutenant Albert Service, Canadian Infantry, Killed in Action, France, August 1916.\"\n\nWith the end of the war, Service  settled down to being a rich man in Paris.... During the day he would promenade in the best suits, with a monocle. At night he went out in old clothes with the company of his doorman, a retired policeman, to visit the lowest dives of the city.. During his time in Paris he was reputedly the wealthiest author living in the city, yet was known to dress as a working man and walk the streets, blending in and observing everything around him. Those experiences would be used in his next book of poetry, Ballads of a Bohemian (1921), The poems are given in the persona of an American poet in Paris who serves as an ambulance driver and an infantryman in the war. The verses are separated by diary entries over a period of four years.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "title": "Robert W  Service - My Madonna", "publishedDate": "2013-11-24T18:23:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "4YdqlrXGAQI", "description": "Nesse v\u00eddeo explico como colocar a tala na orelha do seu Yorkshire Terrier para que elas fiquem empezinhas.

The context is that DEHP plasticiser has been named as a chemical which must be registered with REACH in Europe in 2013 for applications excluding medical. The requirement to register DEHP has caused medical users to question whether they want to continue to use DEHP-plasticised PVC or consider alternative plasticisers like BASF's Hexamol DINCH or Eastman's 168 or look at replacing PVC altogether. \n\nIn other news, Arburg's demo of a lab on a chip moulding is presented and Evonik summarise their news, including the first 510k approval of a spinal implant moulded from their Vestakeep brand of implantable grade PEEK polymer.", "title": "Vlog: Teknor Apex Sees Medical PVC and Alternatives Trend, Evonik's 510k and Arburg's lab-on-a-chip", "publishedDate": "2013-03-05T18:57:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Ym9i1fiR-U", "description": "Seamless coordination Army during Practice", "title": "Seamless coordination Army during Practice", "publishedDate": "2014-05-08T07:41:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "4YmLv2xeIDQ", "description": "Ben has chance to ride on a hayride with his big brother Lee but he doesn't want to! It just might be close to somebody's nap time! I don't know - I'm just thinking in my head!\n\n+++\n\nIt was with great anticipation that I began viewing \nthe videos by Professor Howdy on YouTube and\nhis two Blogs!\n\nThe Professor is simply amazing at retelling an \nold story in a contemporary manner with exquisite \nClassical Music accompanied with H.D. Photographs \n& sprinkled with alluring, charming, classy and \nbewitching Video Clips! Rather than containing\nsimply one music selection, the Professor includes\nup to four popular music sensations on each 15\nminute video! \n\nThe High Definition photographs were beautiful \nbeyond words and supplemented with those was \nthe most heavenly music one will ever hear! With \na creative genius' ability to carry us around the \nglobe and to fall unrestrainedly in love with every\nbeautiful creature shown, the Professor lifts & \nrelaxes not only our spirits but our emotions as \nwell. \n\nOne may ask why so many beautiful women \nare incapsulated into each video but these\nare about love & the celebration of pure\nromance which saves coitus until after\nthe marriage vows - Something Hollywood\nand most media despise! But for the fortunate\nfew, a lifetime of love with one partner\nmay be actualized for a lifetime! Then\n& only then does a Honeymoon become \nintriguing, truly electrifying, sensational,\nriveting & spellbinding! \n\nEach viewer may substitute his or herself\ninto these video stories and become part\nof the rapturous novels. The male viewer\nbecomes the romancer of the beauty within \nthe ratiocination story while the female viewer \nbecomes the romanced interminably! \n\nNow with some 500+ videos available, one can \nenter the world of musical enchantment similar \nto Narnia or Middle Earth with spell bounding \nemotional attachment to each world musically \npresented. Of special note while viewing each \nmusical video, it is often nearly impossible at times\nto determine whether a photograph or video is \nbeing used during a particular segment. \n\nEach pulchritudinous video tells it own allegorical \nfifteen minute novel with statuesque and emblematic \nawareness! Remember that his Music Videos are \ndefined as theater of the mind! \n\nPart of the Genius also in these opulent & ostentatious \nvideos are not only in the Transitions that change \nbeautifully in slow motion but the charmingly, daintily, \ndelicately & delightful photographs & videos that \nameliorate the musical narrative! \n\nOnly one with low intelligence quotient or attention \ndeficit will not be relaxed, cheered & entertained by \nthese astounding video novelettes. Medical studies\nhave shown that these videos even lower one's\nblood pressure when needed. \n\nThis magic world may be entered through the \nportholes of the Wardrobe, Narnia, YouTube, \nFaceBook or the Professor's Blogs! Enjoy the \nmusical adventure (and be sure to click the \nproper buttons below the screen to view with \nyour computer's full screen).

Verily, Allah is severe in punishment.\" [Qur'\u00e2n 59:7] \n\nAllah has also made the obedience of Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu`alaihiwasallam) in conjunction with the obedience to Him:\n\"And obey Allah and the Messenger, that ye may obtain mercy.\" [Qur'\u00e2n 3:132]\n\nWe are asked by Allah (subhaanahuwata`aalaa) to answer any order by Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu`alaihiwasallam):\n\"O ye who believe! give your response to Allah and His Messenger, when He calleth you to that which will give you life.\" [Qur'\u00e2n 8:24]\n\nAllah made the obedience of Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu`alaihiwasallam) an obedience to Him, and following Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu`alaihiwasallam) an indication of the love of Allah subhaanahuwata`aalaa:\n\"He who obeys the Messenger, obeys Allah.\" [Qur'\u00e2n 4:80]\n\n\"Say: If ye do love Allah, Follow me: Allah will love you and forgive you sins.\"  [Qur'\u00e2n 3:31]\n\nAnd Allah subhaanahuwata`aalaa warned us from not following the instructions of Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu`alaihiwasallam):\n\n\"Then let those beware who withstand the Messenger's order, lest some trial befall them, or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them.\" [Qur'\u00e2n 24:63]\n\nNot only that, but Allah (subhaanahuwata`aalaa) told us that disobeying Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu`alaihiwasallam) is Kufr (disbelief): \"Say: Obey Allah and His Messenger.: But if they turn back, Allah loveth not those who reject Faith.\" [Qur'\u00e2n 3:32]\n\nIt was never allowed by Allah (subhaanahuwata`aalaa) that a believer disobey Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu`alaihiwasallam's) order:\n\"It is not fitting for a Believer, man or woman, when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if any one disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path.\" [Qur'\u00e2n 33:36]\n\nTo show that not following the ruling of Rasoolullaah (sallallaahu`alaihiwasallam) when a dispute occurs is a sign of hypocrisy, Allah (subhaanahuwata`aalaa) says:\n\"They say, We believe in Allah and in the apostle, and we obey; but even after that, some of them turn away; they are not (really) Believers. When they are summoned to Allah and His apostle, in order that He may judge between them, behold some of them decline (to come)....The answer of the Believers, when summoned to Allah and His Messenger, in order that He may judge between them, is no other than this: they say, \"We hear and we obey\"; it is such as these that will attain felicity.\" [Qur'\u00e2n 24:47-51]", "title": "Oh Muslim Ummah Wake Up!

Ammonia gas has been used in the past, and is still used in large commercial systems, but it's also explosive and not fit for automotive use. Today, R134a, HFO1234yf and possibly CO2 are or will be in use for automotive purposes. R134 has completely replaced R12, with HFO1234yf being implemented in newer models.

Towards the heel of the well, the ball valve size for each sleeve unit increases, such that the ball for the first stage at the toe of the well can be inserted through all the sleeves but the first. When the balls seat at their given sleeve, they form a seal that allows the heelward side of the hole to be pressurized, causing the sleeve to slide toeward, which opens hydraulic access to the formation.\n\n4.

More Info: http://www.beadsandbeading.com/blog/?... Polymer Clay Tutor.\n\nTopics Covered In This Video:\n\n* In a previous video not too long ago, I talked about buying fresh polymer clay. Sometimes that means the clay is very soft and squishy, and may be difficult to work with for some polymer clay techniques, especially caning.\n\n* In this video I will show you how you can remove the excess plasticizers and oils (leaching) making the clay much firmer.\n\n* Role out your soft squishy clay with your pasta machine to make a sheet.\n\n* Place the sheet of clay between two sheets of plain white office paper (no printing on it) and set on a non-porous surface for a day or so, for the excess oils to soak into the paper, making the clay firmer.\n\n* Don't set your clay and paper onto a porous surface like a wood table or a stack of books... or they will get stained by the oils.\n\n* I like to weight mine down with some ceramic tiles, to speed up the leaching process.\n\n* For a faster way, roll out your sheet of soft clay and put it in between a folded piece of paper, and run it through the pasta machine (paper and all), to force the paper to soak up the oils more quickly. You may need a clay blade to scrape the clay off the paper, but you will find this quick method to be much faster than having to wait for a day or so for the leaching to happen on its own.\n\n* If you liked this video please click the \"Thumbs Up\" button... and don't forget to subscribe to my channel so you don't miss out on all of the new videos that I publish once or twice a week... each and every week.\n\n* Additional Resources... http://www.beadsandbeading.com/blog/", "title": "Leaching Soft Polymer Clay To Make It Firmer", "publishedDate": "2013-07-08T07:00:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Z9jjzFzG-g", "description": "A fighter jet flying through eastern Libya crashed dramatically in the city of Tobruk on Tuesday, killing the pilot and at least one small boy.

The Heating is about as warm as a hot tub. Research has shown that heat can damage or kill cancer cells in some tumors while also making radiation and chemotherapy more effective.\n\nWhile it has been known for hundreds of years that fevers can kill cancer, only recently has technology been developed that can control and focus heat specifically on tumors.\n\nLocal hyperthermia treatment (heat applied to a very small area, such as a tumor) is a well-established cancer treatment. Primary malignant tumors have a bad blood circulation, which make them more sensitive to changes in temperature.\n\n\n\"Our own clinical experience and the results of numerous published studies are highly encouraging in that increased use of hyperthermia will improve the quality of life for cancer patients and improve control of cancer recurrences.\"\n\nDr. Gerald Sokol, New Hope Cancer Center, Hudson, FL.\n\n\n\"Hyperthermia is offering our patients new hope. We are often seeing faster responses, better cancer control, and fewer side effects.\"\n\nDr. Leland Rogers, GammaWest, Salt Lake City, Utah\n\n\n\"Hyperthermia gives us a method to treat people when there are few other alternatives. It's an additional form of treatment that can be done in difficult cases, usually without serious side effects or complications.\"\n\nDr. Steven Stroup, Centennial Hospital, Nashville, Tenn.\n\n\n\"When the tumor is of larger size, it is unresectable surgically. Also, radiation has less effect on the center part of the tumor, which is deprived of the oxygen blood supply and the nutrients. By increasing the temperature of the tissues from 42-44 degrees centigrade, (hyperthermia) increases the circulation, increases the oxygenation, so that the radiation is more effective.\"\n\nNasir Syed, Long Beach Memorial Center, Long Beach, CA", "title": "MD Describes Hyperthermia Treatment of Breast Cancer", "publishedDate": "2008-06-14T12:47:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ZN9Hlg6IIA", "description": "http://www.budk.com/product/Timber-Wolf-Ti-Coated-Rainbow-Pocket-Knife/158312.uts?\n\nThis new folder is sleek, stylish, and sharp!

One of the oldest medical documents known to man dating back to 1500 BC recorded the use of Frankincense oil by physicians and priests alike for the treatment of disease and illness. In the Holy Bible the reference to Frankincense brought by the three wise men to the baby Jesus attests to the value placed on this oil.  It was of great value then and even now the difficulty in sourcing makes it one of the more expensive essential oils.  Gum resin from trees in Oman, India, Somalia and Yemen and other areas of North Africa yeild much of the worlds Frankincense. (...) Frankincense comes from the country of Oman, the family is Burseraceae, and the oil is steam distilled from the resin tears extracted from the tree.\n\nTypical Applications\n\nAncient ritual usage and modern research confirm that Frankincense has relaxing effects on the human body including uplifting mood and heightening awareness.  These antidepressant properties can be achieved through various diffusion techniques and topical application including various forms of massage.  This oil is also well suited to help with skin conditions.  It is a mild oil that in most instances can be applied directly, if necessary.  Help with acne to wrinkles, cuts and wounds to reducing scarring are all mentioned by those that have used this essential oil.  Most practical for skin application is to make a 1% to 2% dilution with a carrier oil or a similar dilution in an ointment.\n\nhttp://www.OurFamilyOils.com - Call or Text Brie at (813) 856-9446 for help.", "title": "do\u0304TERRA Frankincense Essential Oil", "publishedDate": "2014-10-14T00:42:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ZT7tEBvluY", "description": "Build-A-Bear Workshop is getting into the holiday spirit with Team Santa, an adorable line of stuffed reindeer toys and accessories.

Standard care is what medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy, and allied health professionals, such as nurses and physical therapists, practice.\n\nComplementary medicine is used together with standard medical care. An example is using acupuncture to help with side effects of cancer treatment.\n\nAlternative medicine is used in place of standard medical care. An example is treating heart disease with chelation therapy (which seeks to remove excess metals from the blood) instead of using a standard approach.\n\nThe claims that CAM treatment providers make can sound promising.

The novel device holds the eyelids between the rings, and a hole in the center of the device provides a surgical field. We used the novel device in cataract surgery (75 eyes), glaucoma surgery (eleven eyes), vitrectomy (ten eyes), and intravitreal injection (six eyes) and evaluated its clinical efficacy.\n\nResults: The LiDrape was easy to attach and detach. The novel device was not detached from the eye during surgery. No eyelashes or secretions from the meibomian glands were seen in the surgical field, and the drape provided a sufficient surgical field.\n\nConclusions: The LiDrape functions as a lid speculum as well as a drape. Our results showed that the novel device is useful for ocular surgeries.\n\nRead the Methodology paper here: http://www.dovepress.com/development-of-a-novel-disposable-lid-speculum-with-a-drape-peer-reviewed-article", "title": "A disposable lid speculum with a drape [ID 45132]", "publishedDate": "2013-08-05T02:38:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ZcWRjz2s8g", "description": "Bebe de tamandu\u00e1 bandeira, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Beb\u00e9 oso hormiguero gigante, Baby-Riesenameisenb\u00e4r, Bambino gigante formichiere, B\u00e9b\u00e9 fourmilier g\u00e9ant, Baby giant anteater,", "title": "Bebe de tamandu\u00e1 bandeira, Myrmecophaga tridactyla,", "publishedDate": "2012-12-19T22:42:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Zcfh5mbICY", "description": "Description;\n\nhttp://www.denverfoundationrepaircontractors.com  Call us for help now at: 720-897-0999\n\nThere are several factors that may trigger foundation problems, from intrusions of tree roots and soil issues to increased dampness.

He then goes into his monologue, telling us all about a walk he's been on, that was advertised as 'A Pleasant Stroll in the Bunion Country'!  He tells of how he followed the directions as best he could, going past a gasometer (actually Davey Burnaby and Teddy Brown) and the glue factory, sewage farm, soapworks and rubbish dump.  \n\n\n\nHe reaches a 'prehistoric pub' called 'The Fried Fish and Face Ache', passes it with great reluctance, then rests in a slate quarry full of gramophone records, \"known locally as 'Christopher Stonehenge'\" - Handley makes theatrical chuckle at his joke (Christopher Stone was a broadcaster in the 30s, presumably an early DJ!).  \n\n\n\nTommy tells of how he strode unknowingly into a nudist camp where people were playing 'Blind Man's Buff', then meets two policemen.

Video para el Aula de Naturaleza del Colegio de la Presentaci\u00f3n de Guadix (Granada)\n\n\u00c1guila es el nombre dado a las mayores aves depredadoras. Las diversas especies y subespecies de \u00e1guilas pueden encontrarse en casi cualquier parte del planeta excepto en la Ant\u00e1rtida. Son miembros de las aves de presa, del orden de Accipitriformes,1 (o Falconiformes acorde a una clasificaci\u00f3n anterior),2 familia Accipitridae, subfamilia Buteoninae. Pertenecen a varios g\u00e9neros, los cuales est\u00e1n sujetos a una reclasificaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s adecuada puesto que los expertos no llegan a una opini\u00f3n consensuada. Las \u00e1guilas se caracterizan principalmente por su gran tama\u00f1o, constituci\u00f3n robusta y cabeza y pico pesados.\nComo todas las aves de presa, las \u00e1guilas poseen un pico grande, poderoso y puntiagudo para desprender la carne de su presa. Cuentan tambi\u00e9n con tarsos y garras poderosas. Llama tambi\u00e9n la atenci\u00f3n la fuerza de las \u00e1guilas, que les posibilita alzar en vuelo a presas mucho m\u00e1s pesadas que ellas. Adem\u00e1s poseen una vista extremadamente aguda que les permite visualizar potenciales presas a distancia, por ejemplo el \u00e1guila real posee dos puntos focales en sus ojos, uno para mirar de frente y otro para localizar la mirada hacia los costados escudri\u00f1ando a la distancia.\nLas \u00e1guilas han sido utilizadas por muchos pueblos como s\u00edmbolo nacional y especialmente s\u00edmbolo imperial, mostrando tanto poder\u00edo como belleza. Del Imperio romano es que, en general, otros estados han tomado la forma m\u00e1s usual del emblema con un \u00e1guila; el Imperio bizantino aport\u00f3 el s\u00edmbolo del \u00e1guila bic\u00e9fala.\nEl \u00e1guila era sin\u00f3nimo de poder para muchos pueblos antiguos como los Mochica del antiguo Per\u00fa, mayas y aztecas.", "title": "Aguila especie roja - Aula de naturaleza", "publishedDate": "2012-06-17T13:58:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Zj0tJXj25Q", "description": "well lifes been i bit cray te last few weeks... turns out my friends arnt who they seemed so dont be counting on seeing ciara ever again as shes not all that great of a friend fenora likewise.. basically been trying to make a fairly big desision and I have made my chooise and am happy with hence the video and No it isnt worth it anymore acctually!! horseys are good have gotten over their sickness and vet gave the all clear so the quarintine has been lifted thankgod.. there is a xmas show down at the yard on sunday. was gunna dress marv up as a reindeer XD but cant really bring him and leave sheena on her own! if she went as far as jumping over her stable door when he was just outside haha there is no way she'd cope on her own but oh well there will be other shows haha um not much else really....

Born in 1950, Beverly grew up bright and ambitious in a working-class neighborhood in Connecticut; her father was a tough but good-hearted cop who listened to his daughter's problems, and her mother was a nervous woman eager to imagine the worst. From an early age, Beverly displays a keen intelligence and an interest in literature, and dreams of going to college in New York and becoming a writer. However, she also develops an early interest in boys, and at 15 finds herself madly in love with a boy from her high school. However, an attempt to get his attention leads to an embarassing incident at a party, and Ray, a sweet but thick-headed 18-year-old, steps forward to defend her. Beverly and Ray end up making out, and after one thing leads to another, Beverly discovers she's pregnant. Telling Ray is only marginally less difficult than informing her parents, and at 16, Beverly is a wife and mother. Against the odds, Beverly is determined to still finish high school and go on to college, but that goal becomes more difficult with time, especially after Beverly's marriage begins to fall apart. Ray tries to do the right thing but has trouble holding a job, and becomes addicted to heroin.", "title": "Riding in Cars with Boys Trailer", "publishedDate": "2006-05-02T05:16:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Zu58SM4BE8", "description": "Subscribe for free to Dr. Greger's videos at http://bit.ly/nutritionfactsupdates\nDESCRIPTION: Those who eat meat risk food poisoning from undercooked meat, but also exposure to cooked meat carcinogens in well-cooked meat. By boiling meat, non-vegetarians can mediate their risk of both. I've previously mentioned the E. coli or cancer conundrum in my video Carcinogens in Roasted Chicken? (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-chicken/) Animal products may also increase prostate cancer risk through other mechanisms (see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-answer-to-the-pritikin-puzzle/ and http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/). More on pancreatic cancer in Largest Study Ever (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/largest-study-ever/).\n \nA similar study where they compared the excretion of carcinogens formed in processed meats can be found in Prevention Is Better Than Cured Meat (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prevention-is-better-than-cured-meat/).\n \nThose eating out may find my video Fast Food Tested for Carcinogens (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-tested-for-carcinogens/) useful, where chicken items from seven restaurant chains were tested for heterocyclic amines to see which was worse\u2014the answer may surprise you.\n \nOh, and if there are carcinogens in roasted chicken, what about roasted coffee? See Carcinogens in Roasted Coffee? (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/carcinogens-in-roasted-coffee/) and Coffee and Cancer (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/coffee-and-cancer/).\n \nIn last Wednesday's video Estrogenic Cooked Meat Carcinogens (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/estrogenic-cooked-meat-carcinogens/) I showed that these cooked meat carcinogens may stimulate breast cancer cell growth nearly as much as pure estrogen. In my last video PhIP: The Three Strikes Breast Carcinogen (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/phip-the-three-strikes-breast-carcinogen/) I showed that these chemicals may promote breast cancer invasiveness even more than estrogen. In the next video, Heterocyclic Amines in Eggs, Cheese, and Creatine? (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heterocyclic-amines-in-eggs-cheese-and-creatine/), I'll explore how even those eating vegetarian may be exposed to these compounds.\n\nHave a question for Dr. Greger about this video?

April 2013, Opernhaus D\u00fcsseldorf\nim Rahmen des Ballettabends b.15\n\nVor der pointilistischen, schwarz-wei\u00dfen \"Landscape with Boat\" von Roy Lichtenstein entfaltet sich eine faszinierende naturhafte Bewegungswelt. Wie Algen in der Str\u00f6mung des Wassers, V\u00f6gel treibend im Wind erscheinen die T\u00e4nzerinnen und T\u00e4nzer in ihren von Suzanne Gallo kreierten weich-flie\u00dfenden und mit weiten Fl\u00fcgeln an Armen und Beinen ausgestatteten wei\u00dfen Kost\u00fcmen in einem nie abrei\u00dfenden Bewegungsstrom. Die 1998 in Paris uraufgef\u00fchrte Choreographie \"Pond Way\" z\u00e4hlt zu Merce Cunninghams sogenannten \"Naturstudien\", ein poetisch-kontemplatives Tanzst\u00fcck von gro\u00dfer figurativer Kraft.\n\nAls Merce Cunningham im Juli 2009 im Alter von 90 Jahren verstarb, endete auch eines der bedeutendsten Kapitel der Tanzavantgarde des 20. Jahrhunderts. Komponisten wie John Cage, David Tudor, Earle Brown, Walter Zimmermann, Brian Eno und Takehisa Kosugi z\u00e4hlten zu seinen Partnern, Bildende K\u00fcnstler wie Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Morris, Bruce Nauman, Jasper Johns und Mark Lancaster waren seine Mitarbeiter. In engem Austausch und doch v\u00f6llig unabh\u00e4ngig von ihnen kreierte der amerikanische T\u00e4nzer und Choreograph Cunningham seine Werke mittels Zufallsoperationen, inspiriert durch die chinesische Lehre des I-Ging: Unabh\u00e4ngig von der Musik, mit der sie lediglich die Spieldauer gemeinsam haben, unabh\u00e4ngig aber auch - und doch auf zugleich merkw\u00fcrdige und unerkl\u00e4rliche Art miteinander eine Symbiose eingehend - von B\u00fchne, Licht und Kost\u00fcmen. Den Tanz begriff Cunningham als r\u00e4umlich-zeitliches Ph\u00e4nomen. Von jenem von der klassischen Danse d'\u00e9cole imaginierten zentralen Mittelpunkt im B\u00fchnenraum und T\u00e4nzerk\u00f6rper wollte er nichts wissen. Vielmehr ereignete und entwickelte sich f\u00fcr ihn - einer These Albert Einsteins folgend - Bewegung in jedem Teil des K\u00f6rpers und des Raumes: \"Es gibt keine festen Punkte im Raum.\" Wenn es aber \"keine festen Punkte gibt, dann ist jeder gleich interessant und gleich beweglich\". Um den Tanz, die Bewegung, den Bewegungsfluss an sich ging es ihm - und um die Autonomie der einzelnen K\u00fcnste.\n\n\u00a9 Ballett am Rhein\nVideo: Ralph Goertz", "title": "Merce Cunningham: Pond Way", "publishedDate": "2013-04-26T22:55:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_AjzmqlDtg", "description": "Code Orange performing \"Liars // Trudge\" at the American Legion in Glen Lyon, PA on July 1st, 2014.", "title": "Code Orange - Liars // Trudge", "publishedDate": "2014-07-30T02:06:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_Anuo4_Tlo", "description": "Get Him to the Greek Movie Clip - watch all clips http://j.mp/Apolp1\nclick to subscribe http://j.mp/sNDUs5\n\nIntern Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) is thrilled when he learns from Sergio (Sean 'P.

Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) has just landed his dream job in the record industry, and he's eager to prove his worth. His first assignment: travel to London and escort British rock god Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to the show that will re-ignite his career. Before he departs, Aaron is warned by his boss Sergio Roma (Sean Combs) to never let Aldous out of his sight, and never underestimate his capacity for mayhem. Immensely talented yet deeply tortured, Aldous hit the bottle hard after his popularity began to wane and his girl walked out on him. Aldous is locked in the midst of an existential crisis, and rues the thought of being accompanied across the pond by an insincere sycophant. Though it seems like sex is the only thing Aldous ever thinks about, his thoughts turn to romance when he discovers that gorgeous model/pop singer Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) will be in Los Angeles at the time of his concert, too. Jackie Q is the love of Aldous' life, and he'll do anything and everything to win her heart. With the concert fast approaching and Aaron's fledgling career on the line, the race is on to get Aldous to the Greek, and ensure the big show goes off without a hitch.\n\n\"get him to the greek\",\"get him to the greek clip\",\"get him to the greek jeffrey\",\"get him to the greek part 1\",\"get him to the greek songs\",\"jonah hill\",\"sean p diddy combs\",\"nicholas stoller\",comedy,\"showbiz comedies\",\"judd apatow\",\"richard vane\",\"david l bushell\",\"jason segel\",\"rodney rothman\",\"phil eisen\",\"responsibility videos\",\"office videos\",\"aaron green\",\"sergio roma\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++449948,/m/0fby2t,/m/013w7j", "title": "Get Him to the Greek (5/11) Movie CLIP - Handle the Moment (2010) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T12:39:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_AsDfRqDlI", "description": "Free learning from The Open University http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/history-the-arts\n\n---\n\nThe designer of the Louvre Pyramid, I M Pei, talking about the design brief.  \n\n(Part 3 of 6)\n\nPlaylist link http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9B008E0498CA1051\n\nTranscript Link http://media-podcast.open.ac.uk/feeds/a216-art-history/transcript/a216-louvre-french-pyramids_00138_1836.pdf\n\n---\n\nStudy 'Art and its histories' with the OU http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/a216.htm\n\nExplore qualifications in Arts and Humanities with the OU http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/arts-and-humanities/index.htm \n\n---", "title": "Designing the Louvre - The Louvre (3/6)", "publishedDate": "2008-06-24T08:17:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_BCusZqsDQ", "description": "I like reggae, and this groove is very smooth! =)\nThanks for watching!\n\nAudio editing software: Cockos - reaper & propellerhead - reason 5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mr.kabas\nVideo editing software: Sony vegas pro 10 & After effects (for chorma key)\nBass and backing track by me.\nBass guitar: Tobias growler - 1998 - USA", "title": "Bruno Mars - Liquor Store Blues Feat.

The last decade has not been kind to Sweden\u2019s once (and future?) king of safety. First Ford starved their development dollars, then-former CEO Stefan Jacoby had a very public falling out with the company\u2019s new Chinese management (Geely wanted BMW-like limousines while Volvo wanted to retain its Swedish modesty). Such corporate confusion led to precious few new products in Volvo showrooms.\n\nThere would now seem a consensus of where Volvo is heading. The all-new 2015 XC90 was one of the stars of this year\u2019s Paris auto show with turbocharged, hybrid and even plug-in technologies all soon to be available in the company\u2019s extremely important big sport brute (the XC90 was once Sweden\u2019s largest grossing \u2014 not just for cars \u2014 exported product). More immediate, however, is the surprise and delight of the XC60. Smaller, cuter and less brutish than the 90, it has to go head to head with BMW\u2019s X3 and Audi\u2019s Q5, top competitors in an extremely competitive segment.\n\n2015 Volvo XC60\n2015 Volvo XC60\nBrian Harper, Driving\nIt manages this with typical Swedish stalwartness. When Volvo turbocharges an engine, for instance, it is for a diesel-like low-end torque not the high-end power its mega-boosted German competitors seek. The first thing that impresses is the smoothness of the XC60\u2019s 3.0-litre, turbocharged inline six. Below 4,000, the thing fairly purrs, its 325 pound-feet of torque coming in with an immediate rush and the six-speed automatic shifting with virtual imperceptibility. Oh, it will cackle and thrash a bit if you push it to its 6,000-rpm redline, but since the low-end torque is so abundant, there\u2019s absolutely no reason for the fuss.\n\nBrian Harper: I wish I could share your surprise and delight, Dave, but the XC60 strikes me as a once-leading luxury-oriented sport-ute that has been surpassed by its competition. And you are absolutely right; it is competing in an extremely tough segment \u2014 one that rewards innovation. Don\u2019t forget, the concept version of the 60 was unveiled at the 2007 North American International Auto Show, the production version finding its way into dealerships two years later. That\u2019s a lot of water under the bridge.\n\nIt\u2019s not the fundamentals, either; it\u2019s the details. The powertrain is sound, albeit thirsty.

This is just something I did because it holds personal value to me. (SEE STORY BELOW)\n\nSTORY:\nWhen I was about 13 I found this wonderful place in the woods with my friends. It was somewhere to relax and be in peace away from the troubles of the world, and it holds an incredible importance in my life. Without this place there probably wouldn't have even been a CatchingYourClouds, as it is where I finally and officially decided that I wanted to start releasing music under that alias, or at all, rather than keeping everything I wrote within the confines of my own room.\n\nOver time my friends stopped coming here, but I never did. I carved my initials in the tree stump when I first came here over 7 years ago, and after not being here for almost 3 years, it was such a relieving and calming feeling to see it still there.\n\nIt took a lot for me to come back here, this is a very emotional place to me, and after I stopped rolling the camera, I probably sat here for hours just pondering and listening to the many sounds of the water hitting the stepping stones in the creek to the trains that still pass by here every once and a while.\n\nDisregarding the lack of \"professionalism\" in filming this, I wanted to bring you all on this first trip back with me, because of how much it means to me, just like all of you, and CatchingYourClouds in general. I'm so wonderfully grateful to share this entire adventure I've had with you all, and I hope we can continue to Traverse it together.\n\n________________________________________\n\nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/CatchingYourClouds\nTWITTER: http://www.twitter.com/drakestopher\n\nYou can buy this song on iTunes here:\nhttp://www.smarturl.it/Traverse", "title": "Stepping Stones - CatchingYourClouds (LYRIC VIDEO)", "publishedDate": "2013-11-21T14:57:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_GiNuG255o", "description": "Soung: Bobble Bobble\nArtist: Cutty ft QQ\nDir: Icey Jcey Film Factory\nhttp://www.solidagency.com\nhttp:www.dancehalldubplates.com for moer information on QQ music/dubplate or booking", "title": "Cutty And Qq- Bobble Bobble", "publishedDate": "2011-03-14T20:06:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_GskCCFBnI", "description": "classic shit off \"Double Exposure\", sampled by DJ Premier for Nas' classic tracks \"N.Y.

Raw Elements sunscreen is a perfect mix of zinc oxide and certified organic sunscreen ingredients that provides the highest levels of protection from the sun while being safe for your skin in the environment. \n\nBrian has been a lifeguard Capt. for 17 years and used chemical based sunscreens to protect his skin. After Brian was shocked when he learned the damaging effects the Sun had taken on his skin, Brian researched and created the best all natural zinc oxide sunscreen on the market. Raw Elements all-natural organic sunscreen carries the highest EWG rating for effectiveness regarding skin protection. Amazingly, this all-natural sunscreen combines zinc oxide with certified organic ingredients which makes this sunscreen completely safe for your skin. This certified organic all natural sunscreen is completely chemical free and uses zinc oxide as the active ingredient.. \n\nRaw Elements all-natural sunscreen has proven so effective that top extreme outdoor athletes from pro volleyball, Pro surfing, Pro paddle boarding, pro skiing as well as other outdoor enthusiasts have adopted Raw Elements to protect their skin. The unique blend of all natural and certified organic sunscreen ingredients is highly water resistant and does not run in your eyes even if you come into contact with water OR sweat because of the heat.\n\nYou can purchase Raw Elements all-natural sunscreen, the top-rated EWG sunscreen at http://www.rawelementsusa.com/products-page/ or at our many retail locations.

You may detect this when caring for someone by a pulse check. In the heart of someone with the condition, the upper chambers of the heart called Atria contract randomly and so fast that they do not allow complete filling of the chamber and do not relax correctly between contractions therefore reducing the efficiency of the heart.\n\nThere are about 500,000 people in the UK with the condition and it is the most common heart rhythm disturbance.  The condition affects the person by fast irregular heartbeat, out of breath, dizziness as well as other symptoms but in some people it has no sign or symptoms.  It can affect adults of any age but it affects more as you get older and more men than women.  About 10% of over 75's have the condition and risk is increased in people who excessively smoke or drink. It is also more likely to affect people with high blood pressure, heart valve problems and other conditions.\n\nThere are different types of Atrial Fibrillation and they have different affects on the patient.\n\nParoxysmal atrial fibrillation -- this comes and goes and usually stops within 48 hours without any treatment\n\nPersistent atrial fibrillation - this lasts for longer than seven days (or less when it is treated)\nLongstanding persistent atrial fibrillation - this usually lasts for longer than a year\nPermanent atrial fibrillation - this is present all the time and there are no more attempts to restore normal heart rhythm\nAlthough uncomfortable at times, someone with Atrial Fibrillation can lead a normal life and the condition can be controlled with medication but it does increase their risk of Stroke. Treatment can vary depending on the person but includes medications to control the Atrial Fibrillation, medicines to reduce the risk of a stroke, cardioversion (electric shock treatment), catheter ablation or having a pacemaker fitted.", "title": "What is Atrial Fibrillation", "publishedDate": "2012-10-05T19:33:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_P2biOFkQs", "description": "ShaoHoopS Production For Duel of da Iron Mic... 2012\n\nexecutant - Rakeem Rauf - http://vk.com/id26572957\nvideo editing - Expos ICU - http://vk.com/id144496494\naudio engineering - Dj BobbA -http://vk.com/shaoboba", "title": "Rakeem Rauf - Liquid Swords (cover)", "publishedDate": "2012-06-07T13:35:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_PIzHfdLGM", "description": "We had her copied from Maisie!", "title": "Our new cloned puppy!", "publishedDate": "2011-05-15T23:43:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_PPb9nZ5-0", "description": "BIOMET 3i now offers Low Profile Abutments and Restorative Components. http://biomet3i.com", "title": "The BIOMET 3i Low Profile Abutment", "publishedDate": "2011-02-01T15:46:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_PwAddVh4w", "description": "Ectopic pregnancy animation", "title": "Ectopic Pregnancy", "publishedDate": "2009-03-03T10:44:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_PwdyEnwnE", "description": "Directed by Konstantinos Arvanitakis, Music: Yiannis Drenogiannis, Post Production: digimojo Production House.
