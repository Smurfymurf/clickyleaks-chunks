We are also facilitating access for them to health services, and above all information,\" he said. Congress member Vidal Llerenas said the move would see a shift away from targeting drug users to rehabilitating them.\n\"(A policy) where the human rights of drug users are respected, without discrimination and without thinking that all drug users are a danger to society or themselves and need, but that they only need to be rehabilitated,\" he said.\n\nIn 2009, Mexico made it legal to carry up to five grams (0.18 ounce) of marijuana, 500 milligrams (0.018 ounce) of cocaine and tiny amounts of heroin and methamphetamines. The PRD also want to increase the amount of marijuana local residents are allowed to 35 grams. But leftist Congress member Manuel Granados said the initiative is not meant to free up drug consumption in the country but bring the health issues of drug users to the fore. \"We're not promising the legalisation of marijuana use or consumption. We are not the proposing the liberalisation of (drug consumption) either. What is being proposed is a change in public policy and decriminalise the drugs topic in favour of (pushing) a public health policy instead,\" he added.\n\nIn September, a group of prominent Mexicans including former ministers, businessmen, artists and Nobel Prize-winning scientist Mario Molina urged the government to decriminalise marijuana in an effort to reduce corruption and lower the income of cartels. President Enrique Pena Nieto has resisted taking that step, but officials have said that he is closely watching developments elsewhere. Lawmakers have said that Mexico is likely to gradually change tack once a bigger section of the Americas has liberalised drug laws.", "title": "MEXICO MARIJUANA LEGALISATION (Left-wing party to push marijuana decriminalisation in Mexico City)", "publishedDate": "2014-02-14T16:06:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9XPxH8Dzw4s", "description": "Afridi and Gul both go for the ball.

If you do you may insult the chef's cooking skills\nIn Tanzania make sure you show up for dinner 20 minutes late. If you come early you'll insult the host\nIn Russia empty bottles of vodka should always be placed on the ground. Putting it back on the table is seen as bad luck\nIn Japan you should never pass food with chopsticks. They are used to pass bones at cremation funerals and using them to pass is considered disrespectful\nIn the UK you should always tilt a bowl of soup away from you. You should spoon the soup away from you as well.\nIn Russia never lick food off your knife. It is considered extremely rude\nIn China you should never cut your noodles. Long noodles symbolize long life and cutting your noodles symbolizes, well...short life\nIn Indonesia you should keep both hands on the table at all times\nIn Italy always politely decline the first offering of food. Upon the inevitable second offering, always accept.\nIn Jamaica people believe that if children eat chicken before they can speak they will never talk. So don't feed chicken to babies.\nIn Nigeria people believe that children who eat eggs will turn into thieves. So, just like in Jamaica, be careful what you offer to children.\nIn France do not rush through your meal. It is considered rude.\nIn Japan never leave chopsticks vertically in your food. This is typically done as an offering to the dead by families at home but in a restaurant it is seen as cursing the owner.\nIn Afghanistan and throughout the Muslim world, eat your food with your right hand, not your left. The left hand is reserved for bathroom hygiene so using it for eating is considered unclean.\nIn France do not leave food on your plate or ask for a box. This implies that you did not enjoy the meal.\nIn Germany the only acceptable food to be eaten with fingers is bread\nIn Kazakstan you will be served tea, but only half of a cup. Don't ask for more because a full cup means that the host wants you to leave\nIn Azerbaijan do not spill the salt because it means you are about to quarrel. Sugar is usually sprinkled on the salt to counter this.\nIn Egypt don't even pick up the salt shaker. It will insult the chef\nIn France you should never split a bill. Either pay the whole thing or pay nothing. Anything else is considered unsophisticated.\nIn Estonia make sure you kiss any bread that falls on the ground before throwing it away.\nIn South Korea when you drink something, turn your head and look away", "title": "25 Dining Taboos From All Over The World That You Should Remember", "publishedDate": "2014-04-25T16:19:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9XTHc24T_Zw", "description": "Tchotchke is my Carin Terrier/Jack Russel mix.

With three witnesses--a cop, a junkie and an eight year old girl--all giving a slightly different story of a murder spree gone awry, the feds all start to notice little inconsistencies.  And it's these little inconsistencies that'll make for one big shock.  Check out the trailer.\n\nI loved this movie the first time I saw it, when it was called Rashomon.

In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world[65] and aspires to bring most of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control[66] beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territories in the Levant region which include Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey.[67] It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations[68] and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group and by other countries such as Colombia[69] as a fundamentalist and extremist organization. The United Nations and Amnesty International have accused the group of grave human rights abuses.\n\nThe Islamic State, still regularly described as ISIL, ISIS or Da\u02bfesh, originated as Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad in 1999.

Nat\u00fcrlich sollte man darauf achten, dass genug Wasser, aber auch genug frische Luft im Beh\u00e4lter ist.\n\n___\n\n\nGeneral Information on Clawed Frogs:\n\n\"The African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis, also known as the xenopus, African clawed toad, African claw-toed frog or the platanna) is a species of African aquatic frog of the Pipidae family. Its name is derived from the three short claws on each hind foot, which it uses to tear apart its food. The word Xenopus means \"strange foot\" and laevis means \"smooth\".\nAfrican clawed frogs can grow up to a length of 5 in (13 cm). They have a flattened head and body, but no tongue or external ears.\nThese frogs are plentiful in ponds and rivers within the south-eastern portion of Sub-Saharan Africa. They are aquatic and are often greenish-grey in color. Albino varieties are commonly sold as pets. \u201cWild type\" African Clawed Frogs are also frequently sold as pets, and often incorrectly labeled as a Congo Frog or African Dwarf Frog because of similar colorings. They are easily distinguished from African Dwarf Frogs because African Clawed Frogs have webbing only on their hind feet while African Dwarf Frogs have webbing on all four feet. They reproduce by laying eggs (see frog reproduction). Also, the clawed frogs are the only amphibians to have actual (though small) claws used to shred foods like fish or tadpoles. They lay their eggs from winter till spring during wet rainy seasons they will travel to other ponds or paddles of water to search for food.\nThe average life-span of these frogs ranges from 5\u201315 years with some individuals recorded to have lived for 20\u201325 years. They shed their skin every season, and eat their own shed skin.\nMale and female frogs can be easily distinguished through the following differences. Male frogs are usually about 20% smaller than females, with slim bodies and legs. Males make mating calls to attract females, sounding very much like a cricket calling underwater. Females are larger than the males, appearing far more plump with hip-like bulges above their rear legs (where their eggs are internally located).\"\nAfrican clawed frog. (2014, September 24).

Die Krallenfr\u00f6sche stellen das afrikanische Gegenst\u00fcck zu den s\u00fcdamerikanischen Wabenkr\u00f6ten (Gattung Pipa) dar.\nDer Glatte Krallenfrosch hat einen flachen Kopf und einen stromlinienf\u00f6rmigen K\u00f6rper, der bei weiblichen Exemplaren etwa 10 bis 13 Zentimeter lang wird \u2013 M\u00e4nnchen bleiben deutlich kleiner. Die R\u00fcckenfarbe ist vorwiegend oliv-braun und der Bauch sowie die Innenseiten der Schenkel meistens hell-beige mit zahlreichen unregelm\u00e4\u00dfig verteilten, kleinen Pigmentierungen. Die wenig entwickelten Vorderbeine haben je vier lange Finger ohne Schwimmh\u00e4ute (im Gegensatz zu den Zwergkrallenfr\u00f6schen). Die auffallend muskul\u00f6sen Hinterbeine tragen je f\u00fcnf Zehen, wobei die drei inneren mit kr\u00e4ftigen, schwarzen Hornkrallen versehen sind, die der Gattung ihren Namen gaben. Zwischen den Zehen befinden sich gro\u00dfe Schwimmh\u00e4ute, die bis an die Zehenspitzen reichen. Diese Fr\u00f6sche sind hervorragende Schwimmer, die auch unter Wasser durch schnelles Rudern und Sto\u00dfen mit den Hinterbeinen erstaunliche Geschwindigkeiten erreichen k\u00f6nnen.\nNormalerweise ern\u00e4hren sich Krallenfr\u00f6sche von wasserlebenden Insektenlarven und W\u00fcrmern; aber auch kleinere Fische sowie Amphibienlarven werden gerne verzehrt. Bei hohen Besatzdichten in Aquarien oder Zuchtanlagen kann unter den Fr\u00f6schen Kannibalismus auftreten. Meist werden die eigenen Eier und Kaulquappen erbeutet, insbesondere, wenn es sich bei letzteren um missgebildete Individuen handelt, die sich \u201eumhertorkelnd\u201c durchs Wasser bewegen.\"\nSeite \u201eKrallenfrosch\u201c.

(The roasting pan will serve as a water bath during baking.)\n\nFor the cake: Add the butter and sugar to a bowl and using an electric hand mixer or stand mixer, beat until light and fluffy, then beat in the egg. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and cocoa in a medium bowl. Beat 1/3 of the flour mixture, and 1/2 of the buttermilk into the egg mixture. Repeat, ending with the flour mixture. Blend until well incorporated.\n\nFor the flan: In a blender, combine the evaporated milk, condensed milk, cream cheese, eggs and vanilla. Blend on high for 30 seconds.\n\nScoop the cake batter into the prepared Bundt pan and spreading evenly. Slowly pour the flan mixture over the cake batter. Cover with foil and add about 1-inch of hot water to the roasting pan.\n\nCarefully slide the pan into the oven, and bake 1 hour, until the surface of the cake is firm to the touch, or an inserted toothpick comes out clean. When cake is done, remove from the water bath and cool completely to room temperature, about 1 hour.\n\nInvert a large, rimmed serving platter over the Bundt pan, grasp tightly together, giggle a little and flip over. Remove the pan and scrape any remaining cajeta from the pan onto the cake, garnish with chopped pecans and serve!\n\nCook's Notes: The batters may appear to mix when you pour them into the pan, but they completely separate while baking, with the flan ending up on the bottom when it's inverted. I like eating it warm, but traditionally, it is chilled 24 hours before serving.\n\nFlan is a rich, creamy, cooked egg custard. It is often flavored with vanilla and baked in a water bath to retain its delicacy.\n\nCajeta is a thick and creamy spread or paste made with caramelized sugar and milk. It is used as a desert on its own or as a topping. Also known as \"dolce de leche,\" it is sold in many supermarkets, Latin specialty markets or online. It can be substituted with a thick caramel sauce.\n\nhttp://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/marcela-valladolid/chocoflan-recipe/index.html", "title": "Impossible Chocolate Flan Bundt Cake Tutorial", "publishedDate": "2013-04-19T03:19:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9XmjR-rVNd0", "description": "This is a mould test for my experimental ultra-short-run silicone-mould-and-resin-casting DIY vinyl project, part of the IndieGogo fundraiser for Girls Rock Camp Vancouver.

It is the result of deteriorated articular cartilage, the slippery cushion at the end of the bones that works to absorb shock and facilitate the easy movement of the bones over each other. When your cartilage wears down, bone rubs against bone and causes pain and swelling. If fragments break off from the bone and cartilage this causes bone spurs.\n\nOsteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis are the two most common forms of arthritis. Although there is no cure for arthritis there are things you can do to reduce chronic pain. With Osteoarthritis the knee is the most commonly affected joint in the body. Proper body alignment is important; people who are bow-legged or knock-kneed for example are more likely to develop arthritis in their knees for example.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is slightly different, your body's immune system turns against itself. Your knee is encased in synovium, a capsule filled with fluid that lubricates the moving parts of your knee. With rheumatoid arthritis, the body's defense against infection turns against the synovium. White blood cells that would normally attack infection go after cartilage and bone. The synovial lining responds by swelling and the muscles and ligaments that surround the knee are weakened and damaged. People with rheumatoid arthritis may experience symptoms of fatigue and unwellness in addition to the symptoms of osteoarthritis. (Remember to get lots of rest if you have RA)\n\nOne of the most important things you can do if you are suffering from arthritis is take an honest look at your weight. Dr. Brian Halpern author of the Knee Crisis Handbook says, \"I tell every single one of my arthritic patients to lose weight if they need to.\"\n\nIf you have osteoarthritis you will experience pain, aching and stiffness in your knee especially after inactivity. You may notice a reduction in the range of motion of your knee joint and hear a crunching sound or feeling when you move your knee.\n\nThe most important thing you can do for arthritis is increase the range of motion of your knee joint. Your instinct is to immobilize your joint and while that might feel good in the short term, it is going to cause more pain in the long term. Also gaining strength for the muscles that support the knee will help relieve some of the stress that the knee joint takes and keep your knee joint healthy.\n\nDoing this yoga video will allow you to feel like you are on top of the disease rather than a victim of it. Remember, do what you can. Don`t expect to be able to do the exercises just like me! I don`t have arthritis in my knees! If you can move your joints through a range of motion that is a third as much or half is much, that is fantastic, work up to full range of motion. There is no perfect or better or best in yoga, what matters is that you show up on your yoga mat and start where you are. Listen to your own body and do what you can today. That is all anybody is asking. Send me your comments and questions. I value your feedback and read and respond to every single response.", "title": "Knee Arthritis Yoga with Dr Melissa West", "publishedDate": "2013-04-13T23:16:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9XrwK_LbRAY", "description": "This is a tribute video I made for Rome 1.

Damien Karras (Jason Miller) that Pazuzu (the devil stone he encountered in Iraq) will do anything to deceive.  Fr. Lancaster Merrin (Max Von Sydow) tells Fr.

The self-proclaimed  minister of God's Holy Word, franklin graham, son of william franklin graham Jr (Billy graham), is probably familiar with the passage.\n\nwilliam franklin graham is a servant of baphomet, not Jesus. He evangelizes the words of the banksters, not almighty God. He does not worship the Lord of Abraham, Moses and Israel. He worships the lords of London.\n\nBlue screen is deception. Wearing a rain coat inside the ABC studio is knowingly participating with the man in the moon - baphomet. Men of God don't deceive their congregations to help worldly leaders achieve tyranny. franklin graham is not a man of God.\n\nTo the shills who like to act like such a high number of co-conspirators would be impossible, we remind all that facts are facts. The 9/11 attack on America by our elected leaders had 1,000's of co-conspirators; willing (all network executives, judy woodruff and franklin graham), unwilling (the hero Peter Jennings), remorseful (kenny johannemann) and did not know (the artists and actors recorded before hand). And, of course, the totally created personalities like dick olly oliver, the WNYW reporter than never was.\n\nCNN transcript at\nhttp://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/14/ltm.10.html\n\n\"There are no accidents\" (Kung fu Panda), so no need to buy the optional car rental damage waiver in Boston or Florida!\n\nImproved NASA apollo 14 (mission to fra mauro) footage as the closing title showing the American Flag blowing in the wind and the tea can in the astronaut's hand.

There are millions of waste pickers worldwide, predominantly in developing countries, but increasingly in post-industrial countries as well.\n\nForms of waste picking have been practiced since antiquity, but modern traditions of waste picking took root during industrialization in the nineteenth century. Over the past half-century, waste picking has expanded vastly in the developing world due to urbanization.\n\nIn many cities, they provide the only solid waste collection service. A methodological tool is available, offering a systematic approach to include / integrate initiatives (Integration Radar or InteRa).\n\nMany terms are used to refer to people who salvage recyclables from the waste stream for sale or personal consumption. In English, these terms include rag picker, reclaimer, informal resource recoverer, binner, recycler, poacher, salvager, scavenger, and waste picker; in Spanish cartonero, chatarrero, pepenador, clasificador, minador and reciclador; and in Portuguese catador de materiais recicl\u00e1veis. A more contemporary term, focusing on the outcome of the professional activity, is \"informal sector recycling\". However, the word 'informal' can be partly misleading, because in practice a continuum between total informality and proper organization in taxed registered formal activities may be encountered.\n\nIn 2008, participants of the The First World Conference of Waste Pickers chose to use the term \"waste picker\" for English usage to facilitate global communication. The term \"scavenger\" is also commonly used, but many waste pickers find it demeaning due to the implied comparison with animals.\n\nA waste picker is different from a waste collector because the waste collected by the latter may be destined for a landfill or incinerator, not necessarily for a recycling facility.\n\n\"Dumpster diving\" generally refers to the practice of anti-consumer and freegan activists who reclaim items such as food and clothes from the waste stream as a form of protest against consumer culture. \"Waste picking\" generally refers to activity motivated purely by economic need.\n\nSource:Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Sharing a printer on a network is easy and can be done by going to the Devices and Printers window and altering the Printer properties. \n\nPrinter share is common to improve the efficiency of a single one.\n\nStep 1 -- Go to the Start menu \n\nFirst of all, let's give the right to the user to share the printer. For that, we will open up the Start menu and then click on the Devices and Printers option.\n\nStep 2 -- Open the default printer properties\n\nWith the Devices and Printers window opened up, right click on your default printer and open up the properties.\n\nStep 3 -- Share the printer\n\nOver here, move to the Sharing tab and tick on the check mark titled \"share this printer\". With that done, apply the changes made and close the window. Through this, we have basically shared the printer on a network.\n\nStep 4 -- Open Start menu to access printer from another computer\n\nNow let's access this shared printer from another computer.\n\nFor that, let's open up the start menu and type the network location where the printer is shared.\n\nStep 5 -- Select the Connect option\n\nAs a result, the shared location window will open up. Over here, simply right click on the printer and choose the Connect option. This will start connecting and installing the printer on your machine. Through this method printer share is a fairly simple process.\n\nStep 6 -- View the Devices and Printers window\n\nWith the installation complete, if you move to the Devices and Printers window, you will see the newly installed printer appearing over here. \n\nThis means that you have successfully shared a printer between multiple computers.\n\nAnd that's it, from this tutorial you can learn how to share a printer.", "title": "How to Share a Printer Between Multiple Computers", "publishedDate": "2013-07-29T22:00:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YLreG2DW50", "description": "http://gags.justforlaughs.com  | Subscribe! http://goo.gl/wJxjG\n\nThe poor officer needs a phone to do an important phone call... to his good friend!

By doing this they maximize the biomass of the turf algae they cultivate and feed on (Brawley and Adey 1977). On many tropical reefs, territorial damselfish can occupy more than 80% of the benthos (Robertson et al. 1980). The aggressive behavior of such territorial fish is effective in warding off solitary and small group herbivores. However, large schooling groups of non-territorial herbivores have been observed overwhelming the defenses of territorial damselfish to gain access to their algal patches (Robertson et al. 1976). For example, in a patch reef habitat in Panama the foraging rate of schooling fish was higher, and attack rates by damselfish were lower compared to solitary fish of the same species (Foster 1985). \n\nCredits\nCinematography: Dr. Stuart Sandin\nEdited by: Neilan Kuntz\nWritten by: Neilan Kuntz\nLocation: Palmyra Island, Line Islands, Central Pacific (2004)\n\nBrawley, S.

This is where our unique water plays its first part. The barley is soaked for two days in the steeps - with the water being changed every day to ensure purity and flavour. Then the water is drained off and the 'green barley' is ready to come down to one of our malting floors to be spread for malting. Which, if you were a gardener you could call germination.\n\nMalting Floor - All around you is over 7 tonnes of green barley gently germinating. Here we are fooling nature into thinking its springtime. The barley starts to put out its shoots as it would in the soil. Technically speaking the important part for us is that the insoluble starch in the grain is being converted into a soluble sugar. Enzymes are also created which we need later in the process\n\nThe Spreading & Turning - At 7.30 on a Monday morning this floor is a hive of activity. The barley leaves the steeps after a weekend soaking and escapes through hoppers into our Chariots. No one knows how old these chariots are as they have been repaired so many times. They're perfect for the job they have to do so, as always, we don't change them. One man lays the green barley and his partner spreads. They work constantly in pairs until about 7 tonnes are spread on the floor. The colder it is the deeper we lay the barley, to ensure the correct germination temperature, 15/16oC, over the seven days.\n\nThe process gives off its own heat which we control manually by opening the windows and constantly turning the grain. You will always see a thermometer in the barley, which is carefully monitored to ensure the temperature remain constant.", "title": "Laphroaig Distillery Tour - Malt Floors", "publishedDate": "2013-06-04T15:22:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YUSQBdAB_8", "description": "Here's a video taken around 5:30pm when the IH was kicking my butt but the dex is in my system preventing me from being able to sleep.

Mr Feige said the first 10 Marvel films, which kicked off in 2008 with Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, have made over $7 billion. \n\nGet the latest headlines http://www.telegraph.co.uk/\n\nSubscribe to The Telegraph http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=telegraphtv\n\nLike us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/telegraph.co.uk\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/telegraph\nFollow us on Google+ https://plus.google.com/102891355072777008500/\n\nTelegraph.co.uk and YouTube.com/TelegraphTV are websites of The Daily Telegraph, the UK's best-selling quality daily newspaper providing news and analysis on UK and world events, business, sport, lifestyle and culture.", "title": "Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans map out plans for future Marvel films", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T23:18:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YUvrzAnAAc", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/waldisneyy", "title": "stay different ; camber.", "publishedDate": "2014-07-30T16:44:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YUwiQDZDPg", "description": "Chevy Strong we puted a new rear end in my wreck truck n thought maybe we could move it  \nto have the motor swap to my new truck n its funny so im just sharing this with your'll on here", "title": "Goober Red-necking Way", "publishedDate": "2013-10-07T02:17:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YUxy2l5DhE", "description": "PASTIS 49 You Have to Travel!\n\nCoreographer Hagit Yakira during a lesson.

The child is egocentric -- which is they have problems distinguishing from their own perceptions and perceptions of others. A classic example is, a preoperational child will cover their eyes so they can not see someone and think that that person can not see them either.\nThe child also has rigid thinking, which involves the following:\nCentration -- a child will become completely fixed on one point, not allowing them to see the wider picture. For example, focusing only on the height of the container rather than both the height and width when determining what has the biggest volume.\nState -- can only concentrate on what something looks like at that time.\nAppearance -- focuses on how something appears rather than reality.\nLack of Reversibility -- can not reverse the steps they have taken. Does not realize that one set of steps can be cancelled by another set of steps.\nLack of Conservation -- realizing that something can have the same properties even if it appears differently.\n\nFind out more about Piaget's theory of cognitive development at: http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_theory", "title": "Piaget's theory of cognitive development", "publishedDate": "2011-05-04T05:33:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YXT1_9k-k0", "description": "", "title": "O esc\u00e2ndalo dos ovos contaminados na Alemanha", "publishedDate": "2011-01-12T16:17:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YY8udkPX7s", "description": "", "title": "Todo cine: El misterioso Macguffin", "publishedDate": "2013-04-08T10:08:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YYggig6QK0", "description": "\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u062a\u0631\u062f\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0628\u0631 Al-azzah Arab Satelittes Channels", "title": "Al azzah tv", "publishedDate": "2014-03-29T23:09:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YYo9fV2l3E", "description": "", "title": "Incantation - Impalement of Divinity", "publishedDate": "2014-07-16T01:28:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YYxgMRIMZU", "description": "The Mount Union Fire Company thanks the Saxton Fire Company for hosting the 2009 Huntingdon County Fireman's Association Convention in the traditional style while leaving the Borough of Saxton on Saturday night following the awards ceremony.

Su importancia en todas ellas se debe a que est\u00e1 relacionada con las simetr\u00edas rotacionales de los sistemas f\u00edsicos. Bajo ciertas condiciones de simetr\u00eda rotacional de los sistemas es una magnitud que se mantiene constante con el tiempo a medida que el sistema evoluciona, lo cual da lugar a una ley de conservaci\u00f3n conocida como ley de conservaci\u00f3n del momento angular. El momento angular para un cuerpo r\u00edgido que rota respecto a un eje, es la resistencia que ofrece dicho cuerpo a la variaci\u00f3n de la velocidad angular. En el Sistema Internacional de Unidades el momento angular se mide en kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s.\nEsta magnitud desempe\u00f1a respecto a las rotaciones un papel an\u00e1logo al momento lineal en las traslaciones. Sin embargo, eso no implica que sea una magnitud exclusiva de las rotaciones; por ejemplo, el momento angular de una part\u00edcula que se mueve libremente con velocidad constante (en m\u00f3dulo y direcci\u00f3n) tambi\u00e9n se conserva.\nEl nombre tradicional en espa\u00f1ol es momento cin\u00e9tico, pero por influencia del ingl\u00e9s angular momentum hoy son frecuentes momento angular y otras variantes como cantidad de movimiento angular o \u00edmpetu angular.\nHay muchos fen\u00f3menos en los cuales la conservaci\u00f3n del momento angular tiene mucha importancia. Por ejemplo:\nEn todos las artes y los deportes en los cuales se hacen vueltas, piruetas, etc. Por ejemplo, para hacer una pirueta, una bailarina o una patinadora toman impulso con los brazos y una pierna extendida para aumentar sus momentos de inercia alrededor de la vertical. Despu\u00e9s, cerrando los brazos y la pierna, disminuyen sus momentos de inercia, lo cual aumenta la velocidad de rotaci\u00f3n. Para terminar la pirueta, la extensi\u00f3n de los brazos y una pierna, permite disminuir la velocidad de rotaci\u00f3n. Sucede lo mismo con el salto de plataforma o el trampol\u00edn. Tambi\u00e9n es importante en el ciclismo y motociclismo, ya que la conservaci\u00f3n del momento angular es la responsable de la sencillez con que es posible mantener el equilibrio.\nPara controlar la orientaci\u00f3n angular de un sat\u00e9lite o sonda espacial. Como se puede considerar que los momentos externos son cero, el momento angular y luego, la orientaci\u00f3n del sat\u00e9lite no cambian. Para cambiar esta orientaci\u00f3n, un motor el\u00e9ctrico hace girar un volante de inercia. Para conservar el momento angular, el sat\u00e9lite se pone a girar en el sentido opuesto. Una vez en la buena orientaci\u00f3n, basta parar el volante de inercia, lo cual para el sat\u00e9lite. Tambi\u00e9n se utiliza el volante de inercia para parar las peque\u00f1as rotaciones provocadas por los peque\u00f1os momentos inevitables, como el producido por el viento solar.\nAlgunas estrellas se contraen convirti\u00e9ndose en p\u00falsar (estrella de neutrones). Su di\u00e1metro disminuye hasta unos kil\u00f3metros, su momento de inercia disminuye y su velocidad de rotaci\u00f3n aumenta enormemente. Se han detectado pulsares con periodos rotaci\u00f3n de tan s\u00f3lo unos milisegundos.\nDebido a las mareas, la luna ejerce un momento sobre la tierra. Este disminuye el momento angular de la tierra y, debido a la conservaci\u00f3n del momento angular, el de la luna aumenta. En consecuencia, la luna aumenta su energ\u00eda alej\u00e1ndose de la tierra y disminuyendo su velocidad de rotaci\u00f3n (pero aumentando su momento angular). La luna se aleja y los d\u00edas y los meses lunares se alargan.", "title": "Principio de la conservaci\u00f3n del momento Angular", "publishedDate": "2014-07-02T11:32:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YpRu3ZeNSs", "description": "http://oobehiphop.blogspot.com/\n\nSong by Sick Since", "title": "Gnostic Media | Music Video", "publishedDate": "2007-09-06T03:43:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Yp_Xj6YshM", "description": "http://www.patentlawip.com/  Los Angeles Patent and Trademark Attorney discusses Intellectual Property Law and the basics of Patent Law and Trademark Law.", "title": "Intellectual Property Law | Patents & Trademarks", "publishedDate": "2008-06-15T22:38:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Ypfr0aM8Bg", "description": "i introduce the first new L4T character Cautious Colin, isnt he wonderful", "title": "Hello Cautious Colin", "publishedDate": "2011-11-11T20:16:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YplH0ZbLoc", "description": "", "title": "15 de Enero de 2014 Avanza obra del Parque lineal la camelina en Uruapan", "publishedDate": "2014-01-16T01:48:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YppLVcYw2s", "description": "This video shows how to create a simple BPMN 2.0 business process diagramm.\nTo learn more about free business process modelling tool ADONIS:Community Edition visit http://www.adonis-community.com", "title": "ADONIS:Community Edition - how to create a BPMN 2.0 business process diagramm", "publishedDate": "2012-05-31T11:20:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Yq3nRmwzCk", "description": "University Innovation Fellows - Application Question 4 - Tell us what you think we should know about you.", "title": "Wigner at ASU You Need to Know", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T01:12:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Yqj2RuUYlk", "description": "NOTE!

Korea will support forest protection at an initial cost of about US$2 million in conducting works on rehabilitation, sustainable forest management and green growth development.\nThe two days of the Dialogue-AFoCO meeting in Vientiane have involved consulting on cooperation in forestry between Asia and Korea. Asean members signed agreements with Korea to establish cooperation on AFoCO in 2011, with Korea providing some financial support for the Asean countries carrying out the project.\nBoth Asean and the Republic of Korea see that the amount of natural green areas in Asia have to become bigger, so the Dialogue-AFoCO partners have invited four more countries in the region to join, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Bhutan and Timor, who will become part of the green zone in the organisation\u2019s logo and help to build Asia into a green zone as well.", "title": "Lao NEWS on LNTV: The RoK supports for about 10 years green development in Laos.1/10/2014", "publishedDate": "2014-10-06T08:41:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Ys7KxIFsZw", "description": "One of the two deer had died from the locked antlers.

When a person eats food that contains sugar and carbohydrates, their pancreas starts producing insulin which will carry the sugar into their cells for energy. Without this insulin, the sugar builds up in our system and can cause many unwanted health problems.\n\nOnce the sugar is built up in your system for a long period of time, health problems can arise. The sugar will start by destroying your blood vessels. It will soon move on to much bigger organs and can cause you to develop heart disease, kidney disease, nerve damage and vision problems. So in order to prevent this from happening and to help keep your body healthy, you need to find out how to effectively lower your blood sugar level.\n\nTo Learn More About Diabetic Diets, Visit:\nhttp://www.diaeticdietsreview.com", "title": "Diabetic Diet - 5 Ways To Lower Your Blood Sugar Level", "publishedDate": "2008-05-23T02:28:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YxIvhjkC7g", "description": "http://mamanatural.com/ Cloth diapers are great. And they're way better than disposables. Here's why.\n\n1. Cloth Diapers are cheaper\n\nDisposable diapers will set you back at least $2,000 before your child is potty trained. And if you buy premium or biodegradable options, that number will look more like $3,000.\n\nWhereas twenty of the most expensive cloth diapers will set you back less than $400. Factor in detergent and water bills, and you're still looking at half the cost of disposables.\n\nSources: Consumer Reports (July 8, 2009). \"Cloth vs. disposable diapers: Getting started\".\nhttp://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1702357,00.html#ixzz1MLGLaVco\n\n2. Cloth diapers are way better for the environment\n\nAn average child will go through anywhere from four to eight thousand diapers in his or her life.\n\nNationwide, parents in the USA use an estimated 27.4 billion disposable diapers each year. That's around 3.4 million tons of diapers that end up in landfills each year.\n\nThe environmental footprint of disposable diapers is staggering.\n\nAnd when you compare all that to using the same twenty cloth diapers over and over, washing them with minimal and safe detergent (method) in a high efficiency washer, there's just no contest.\n\nSources: The number of diapers a child uses comes from the conservative estimate of six per day x 365 x 2 years = 5475 diapers used.\nhttp://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1702357,00.html\n\n3. Cloth diapers are more absorbent\n\nI speak here from experience. With a cloth diaper, I don't have to change my baby in the middle of the night. With disposables, I do.\n\nThen there's the blowout factor. Cloth diapers are generous, and they contain. Disposables, not so much.\n\n4. Disposable diapers are loaded with nasty chemicals\n\nMany parents don't realize that disposable diapers contain some nasty chemicals.\n\nMost disposables are bleached with Dioxin, which, in animal studies, caused nerve damage, birth defects, increased rates of miscarriages and changes to the immune system. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has classified dioxins as a probable human carcinogen.\n\nThen there are AGMs - linked to an increase in childhood asthma and a decrease in sperm count among boys.\nNow, big diaper manufacturers point out that these chemicals exist in very small doses in the diapers, and so don't post a risk. And, sure, more studies need to be done. But Mama Natural says, why risk it?\n\nhttp://allaboutclothdiapers.com/are-disposable-diapers-really-that-bad/ Source: Illinois Dept of Public health http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/factsheets/dioxin.htm http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/04/63182\n\n5. Cloth diapers may help protect your baby boy's jewels\n\nGerman scientists found that the skin temperature around baby boy's genitals was significantly higher when they wore disposable diapers as opposed to cloth. While the scientists called for more research, they suggested that prolonged use of disposable diapers in infants could be an important factor contributing to the decline of sperm production in adult males.\n\n6. Cloth diapers are cuter than disposables :)\n\nColors, patterns, textures. Especially when yr kid's dressed in a diaper only. Cloth are way cuter.\n\n1 Reason Why Cloth Diapers Ain't Better\n\n1. Tyranno-poops\n\nOccasionally, all babies will produce humungous and, frankly, baffling poops. The last thing you want to do is get all hands-on with that diaper, rinse it, store it, etc. Throwing the stinking thing out would be so much easier....\n\nBUT, that's an infrequent and short-term bummer. In the long term, and by just about every single measure, cloth diapers are better for you, your baby, and the world.\n\nWhat do you think? Why do you use cloth diapers? Pregnant?

Examples of foods containing a high proportion of saturated fat include animal fats such as cream, cheese, butter, and ghee; suet, tallow, lard, and fatty meats; as well as certain vegetable products such as coconut oil, cottonseed oil, palm kernel oil, chocolate, and many prepared foods\n\n\nSince cholesterol is essential for all animal life, each cell synthesizes it from simpler molecules, a complex 37-step process which starts with the intracellular protein enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. However, normal and especially high levels of fats (including cholesterol) within the blood circulation, depending on how it is transported within lipoproteins, are strongly associated with progression of atherosclerosis.\nCholesterol is required to build and maintain membranes; it modulates membrane fluidity over the range of physiological temperatures.\nAnimal fats are complex mixtures of triglycerides, with lesser amounts of phospholipids and cholesterol. As a consequence, all foods containing animal fat contain cholesterol to varying extents.[16] Major dietary sources of cholesterol include cheese, egg yolks, beef, pork, poultry, fish, and shrimp.[17] Human breast milk also contains significant quantities of cholesterol\n\nThose who say all fats are bad for you are, of course, dangerously incorrect. As it turns out, plant-based fats are powerful cancer fighters, and even saturated fats from plant sources are now being shown to offer extraordinary health benefits. \n\nIf you want to prevent cancer, or you're currently battling colon cancer, prostate cancer or breast cancer, it is essential to get plant-based fats into your diet on a daily basis. What kind of plant-based fats are we talking about? What are the healthy fats?\n\nCanola oil is what I consider a neutral fat, meaning it's not necessarily a bad fat, but neither is it considered one of the healthier fats. The healthy fats include extra-virgin olive oil, flax seed oil, and fats from plant sources such as nuts, seeds, avocados, and coconuts.\n\nThese healthy fats should be consumed with every meal. Failure to include these fats in a meal will result in many of the nutrients consumed during the meal not being absorbed by the body. That's because many nutrients are fat-soluble nutrients. Beta carotene, Vitamin D, and Vitamin E are three such nutrients that require fat in order to be absorbed and used by the human body, but there are many other nutrients that also need fats for human metabolism. \n\nIncidentally, these oils do much more than just fight cancer, they also improve your cardiovascular health and fight weight gain and obesity. The benefits list is a long one. \n\nThe fact is we all need fats. Fats helps nutrient absorption, nerve transmission, maintaining cell membrane integrity etc. However, when consumed in excess amount, fats contribute to weight gain, heart disease and certain types of cancer. Fats are not created equal. Some fats promote our health positively while other increases our risks of heart disease. The key is to replace bad fats with good fats in our diet.", "title": "Saturated Fats - But You Don't Want To Be Fat.mp4", "publishedDate": "2012-12-22T16:50:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "9YyXtiAe4gU", "description": "My Zbrush ornamental sculpting technique.", "title": "Zbrush ornamental sculpting technique example 1", "publishedDate": "2010-11-29T17:08:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Yyuk263l8Q", "description": "\"The Collection Before The BOOM!..Section 2\" coming soon..\nLyrics:(Ducks,Crabs,& Shrimp) \n\nIntro: Duck, the crab, and shrimp...the lesser girls (4x)\n\nVerse 1: When I enter a room people taking notice, and thats why your really mad and lost your focus.

Gen. Robinson Risner, Jan. 23, at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nA former member of the 336th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, currently known as the 336th FS, Risner's funeral begins at 11 a.m., with the flyover taking place at approximately 12:12 p.m.\n\nAccording to Capt. Reid Thomas, a 336th FS pilot and flyover participant, Risner is an Air Force hero on many levels, having served courageously in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. \n\n\"All of his heroism and amazing self-sacrifice makes it an honor for our squadron to remember a true fighter pilot hero and one of the 336th's own with a befitting missing man flyover,\" said Thomas. \"I personally can't think of a better way to send a nine-foot-tall hero into the wild blue yonder.\"\n\nRisner's list of achievements includes an assignment to the 336th FIS, 4th Fighter Wing, at Kimpo, Korea in May 1952. While with the 336th FIS, he flew more than 100 combat missions in the F-86 Sabre against Mig-15s over North Korea. He's credited with eight enemy aircraft destroyed and became the 20th jet ace during the Korean War. While on temporary duty with the 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, he was shot down over North Vietnam in April 1965 and later rescued. Risner returned to duty, then in September 1965 he was shot down again over North Vietnam and captured. While held prisoner in Hanoi, also known as the Hanoi Hilton, Risner served first as the senior ranking officer and later as vice commander of the 4th Allied Prisoner-of-War Wing.\n\nJames Robinson Risner From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Robinson_Risner\nJames Robinson \"Robbie\" Risner (January 16, 1925 -- October 22, 2013) was a general officer and professional fighter pilot in the United States Air Force.\nRisner was a double recipient of the Air Force Cross, the second highest military decoration for valor that can be awarded to a member of the United States Air Force. He was the first living recipient of the medal, awarded the first for valor in aerial combat during the Vietnam War, and the second for gallantry as a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese for more than seven years.\n\nRisner became an ace in the Korean War, and commanded a squadron of F-105 Thunderchiefs in the first missions of Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965. He flew a combined 163 combat missions, was shot down twice, and was credited with destroying eight MiG-15s. Risner retired as a brigadier general in 1976.\n\nAt his passing, Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark A. Welsh III observed: \"Brig. Gen. James Robinson \"Robbie\" Risner was part of that legendary group who served in three wars, built an Air Force, and gave us an enduring example of courage and mission success...Today's Airmen know we stand on the shoulders of giants.

Because of his upbringing, Jesse Rainfeather Goldman knows almost nothing of Native American traditions. He is doing his internship when he suddenly receives an amulet from the Lakota reservation in Sioux City. It is from his real mother. Jesse's curiosity is piqued, and he immediately travels to his birthplace to learn why she sent it. Unfortunately, by the time he arrives, his mother's body is discovered in the smoldering wreckage of her home. She was shot before she was burned. Jesse's investigation into her death is not welcomed by the local captain of police and his assistant. He is almost beaten to death but is saved by his grandfather, a shaman, and a Lakota woman. The newly healed Jesse begins to explore his tribe's customs.

The campus, called Yale-NUS, \"will pioneer a 'global curriculum' that 'will draw on the best elements of the American liberal arts tradition, but re-shape and re-imagine the curriculum and collegiate experience for Asia,'\" says a statement on the Yale-NUS website.\n\nOn Thursday Yale faculty approved a resolution by a 100 to 69 vote that calls on Yale-NUS \"to respect, protect and further principles of non-discrimination for all, including sexual minorities and migrant workers, and to uphold civil liberty and political freedom on campus and in the broader society.\" Because Yale-NUS will not grant Yale degrees, Yale Corporation did not need to seek approval for the venture from Yale's faculty.\n\nYale President Richard Levin publicly opposed the resolution, as did US pundit and Yale trustee Fareed Zakaria. \"Singapore has a great deal to learn from America, and NUS has a great deal to learn from Yale,\" he wrote in an article published in the Yale Daily News. \"But it is a form of parochialism bordering on chauvinism \u2014 on the part of supposedly liberal and open-minded intellectuals \u2014 not to see that we too, in America and at Yale, can learn something from Singapore.\"\n\n---------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad\nDaily videos brought to you by THE Taiwanese Animators behind the infamous Tiger Woods animation.

The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes Tomistoma, the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.\n__________________________________________________________________\nmore tag : \ncrocodile vs shark,\ncrocodile vs anaconda,\ncrocodile vs tiger,\ncrocodile vs hippo,\ncrocodile vs lion,\ncrocodile vs snake,\ncrocodile vs akainu,\ncrocodile vs doflamingo full fight,\ncrocodile vs zebra,\ncrocodile vs lion fight,\ncrocodile attacks,\ncrocodile attacks human in swimming pool,\ncrocodile attacks human,\ncrocodile attacks zebra,\ncrocodile attacks lion,\ncrocodile attacks man,\ncrocodile attacks full movie,\ncrocodile attacks human live,\ncrocodile attacks human in thailand,\n\nmore videos :\nCrocodile attack Human , Crocodile Chases Swimming Tourist [LIVE] \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6ZIjUMLQAE\n\nCrocodile attack man , Thailand woman dead after jumping into crocodile pit \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JzoVFRz2l4\n\nCrocodile Vs Bull Shark , Animal Fight to Death \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ClBwnBFq0\n\nCrocodile VS Hippo , Hippos attacks Crocodile [DOCUMENTARY] \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSkxNTx2dtg\n\nJaguar vs Crocodile , Jaguar attack Crocodile in river\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXlhK7yTCww \n\nLion vs Crocodile , Lions kills Crocodile Fight to death\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZDfFQvNZ7U\n\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE :  http://www.youtube.com/user/TheCROCODILEattack", "title": "Lion vs Crocodile , Lions kills Crocodile Fight to death", "publishedDate": "2014-09-29T15:26:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ZDf_9dpjFk", "description": "My drum cover of an old favourite of mine, Open your eyes by Guano Apes. \nTakes me back to being 16 when I hear it.

Nancy and Cassie will be glad to help you. :)\n\nThe Services We Provide\n\nSpinal Adjustment\n\nThe term \"adjustment\" refers to the specific manipulation chiropractors apply to vertebrae that have abnormal movement patterns or fail to function normally. The objective of the chiropractic treatment is to reduce the subluxation, which results in an increased range of motion, reduced nerve irritability and improved function.\n\nAt Corbett Chiropractic, we use an adjusting style commonlyadjustment_1.jpg referred to as \"Diversified.\"\n\nUsing the \"Diversified\" technique, a special hand arrangement called a \"pisiform contact\" is used to deliver a specific thrust at the right place and the right time.\n\nSubsequent visits may include motion palpation, with the chiropractor feeling the spinal joints move as you turn and bend. Or, a leg check may be performed, to uncover an imbalance in the neck or lower spine.\n\nWith the malposition of one or more spinal bones identified, a specific manual thrust is administered. The direction, speed, depth and angle that are used is the result of years of experience, practice and a thorough understanding of spinal mechanics.\n\nThe energy delivered during the thrust may produce a slight \"popping\" sound from the shifting of gas and fluids in the joint. This sound may be interesting, but is not a guide as to the value ore ffectiveness of the adjustment.\n\nWhile improving spinal biomechanics can reduce nervous system interferences, virtually all joints of the body can be adjusted to help restore proper range of motion.\n\nAxial Decompression\n\nAxial decompression is an advanced form of traction that can be done to the neck and lower back. \n\nIt's very helpful in reducing pain from protruding, bulging or herniated discs in the neck and lower back. decomp.jpgIt's also beneficial for patients with a degenerative disc disease (arthritis), facet joint disorders, spinal root impingement and hypo-mobility. It can also help relieve chronic and stubborn neck and lower back discomfort.\n\nThe goal of Axial Decompression is to take pressure off the disc, relax tight muscles, relieve nerve compression, mobilize the vertebral joints, improve blood flow and decrease pain.  Patients most commonly begin to feel a relief of pain within the first few sessions. They also report less back spasm, less arm or leg pain and the greater range of motion. Typically patient's receive  axial decompression daily for one week and three times a week until the symptoms are gone.  An average care plan is approximately 5-7 weeks.\n\ncorbett chiropractic, chiro, northfield, mn, 55057, adjustments, axial decompression, Graston, Dr. Dan Corbett, DC, Detoxification, Low level laser light therapy, cold laser, DOT, physicals, orthotic, northfield chiropractor, Nutrition, massage therapy, northfield chiropractic,", "title": "CorbettChiropractic | What you should know if you are injured at work - workmen comp and more", "publishedDate": "2012-05-01T16:17:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ZHUC2vWfmE", "description": "Spiderman attempts to rescue Spiderwoman, who has vanished while searching the Old Spandcity Paint company. he finds she has been hypnotized by the Diabolical Blask Widow and now falls into the Evil Widows trap!

'I'm Ready', on which that familiar sprechgesang delivery is somehow both metronomic and distended, is exemplary, but the whole record -- dosed with menace -- sounds hungry.\" The Guardian 4/5\n\n\"It's fantastic, filled with enough smoky seduction and downtempo grooves to fuel '90s-themed key parties. Come to think of it, it should satisfy old-school Massive Attack fans more than the last couple of Massive Attack LPs\" Time Out\n\n\"His best since the untouchable Maxinquaye, False Idols confidently returns to a simpler, yet contemporary version of Tricky's working formula.\" MusicOMH\n\n\"That's what False Idols represents. Tricky is a hip cat again. The great thing here, though, is he did it the old fashioned way: he just put out a great fucking record. False Idols is a massive triumph musically. There is no filler, in many places it sounds timeless.

They are less often known as widow's tears. It is by far the largest genus of its family, Commelinaceae. The Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus of the 18th century named the genus after the two Dutch botanists Jan Commelijn and his nephew Caspar, each representing one of the showy petals of Commelina communis.\n\nThe dayflowers are herbs that may be either perennial or annual. They are characterised by their zygomorphic flowers and by the involucral bracts called spathes that surround the flower stalks. These spathes are often filled with a mucilaginous liquid. Each spathe houses either one or two scorpioid cymes, with the upper cyme being either vestigial or bearing from one to several typically male flowers, and the lower cyme bearing several flowers. All members of the genus have alternate leaves.\n\nThe Asiatic dayflower (Commelina communis) is probably the best known species in the West. It is a common weed in parts of Europe and throughout eastern North America. Several species, such as Commelina benghalensis, are eaten as a leaf vegetable in Southeast Asia and Africa.\n\nSource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

A Dino is a very powerful move that requires a whole lot of power that you're going to generate from your legs. Basically, what is going to happen is you're going to jump from one position to the second, releasing sometimes both hands and both feet, or sometimes just both of your feet. The critical point is that it's a jump motion, so you are really generating a lot of force to get from one position into another.\n\nOne example of a Dino would be how to solve the problem of getting from this hold all the way over to this hold when they're too apart for me to reach. To execute the Dino, you want to think about initiating that motion from your legs, jumping to create that force, and looking at your target. Part of what makes a Dino work and fail is the timing involved with how you really initiate that move with pushing, the timing of when you release those hands, and things like that.\n\nAn example would be jumping this way. That would be a Dino. As I was leaving the footholds, I'm pressing with my legs to make my body move in the direction I'm headed. If you're moving straight up, part of the timing issue is being able to release those hands at just the right moment so you're body's moving up and not out. In this example, since I was jumping sideways, part of that motion was releasing at just at the right time to be aiming towards that blue hold and not straight up or straight out.\n\nAnother example of a Dino is this one here, where in order to get from these two starting holds all the way out to this big purple hold, I'll need to use a Dino because the holds are too far apart for me to reach while keeping my feet on the wall. Once again, it's very dynamic, very powerful, you're going to be jumping from one position into another. It requires a lot of commitment. You have to be willing to really let go of the wall. At this point, all four appendages are going to be off the wall, and you're going to be jumping grabbing that next hold. Be prepared to grab it and pull in on it. This is what it's going to look like.\n\nThat's another example of a Dino. Also, still using the same timing to make sure that I'm releasing those hand holds at just the right time so my body's going to be jumping at the right direction. I'm ready and committed to doing the move. I'm going to leave those feet. I'm going to be in the air for a second. When you grab that next hold, just hold on. And that would be how to do a Dino.", "title": "How to Do a Dyno in Indoor Climbing | Rock Climbing", "publishedDate": "2013-08-26T18:01:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ZRIkh3EQ8w", "description": "August 18 2012\nTerry, Frankie, and Lucas check out the new RCMP amoured personnel carriers, first hand.

And it's funny.\n\nWritten and directed by husband-and-wife team Kim Evey and Greg Benson of Mediocre Films (one of the most subscribed to content producers on YouTube), the basic premise of the series is pretty much laid out in the show's theme song: \"He is a cop and he's learning-impaired. He's the retarded policeman.\"\n\nBut, believe me, it's so much more.  Well, sort of.\n\nRetarded Policeman, which is, incidentally, also the name of the main character in the show played by Josh \"The Ponceman\" Perry, is a scripted series about a delightful, adorable, completely corrupt, coked-up and cuddly LAPD officer with Down syndrome.\n\nAt this point, you should be either totally intrigued, incredibly disgusted, or both.  Still, some of the funniest jokes ever told are offensive.  And while there are those who maintain that the abhorrent, no matter how hilarious, always has a tinge of hatred, the trend in recent mainstream comedy (most notably with Farrelly Brothers movies, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Family Guy) is to test that theory.\n\nTruth be told, Perry does seem to be having a good time with his character -- there is no question that he's talented and gets into the role.  And it makes for more comfortable viewing when you come to terms with the fact that his character always has the upper hand in any given situation.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this series, however, is how we (and YouTube commentors) react to it.\n\nIsn't it wrong to portray the mentally disabled as drugged-up, racist and horny simpletons with a fondness for peeing in refrigerators? Isn't it incredibly insensitive to allow Josh Perry to seemingly betray himself and others with his syndrome by playing a completely id-driven and absurd character, whose sole purpose is to amuse and shock us? Isn't it unfair to give mean people just another reason to snicker at the mentally-challenged? Isn't it uncouth to say 'retarded' in this day and age? In other words, isn't it horrible to laugh at Retarded Policeman?\n\nThe humor in Retarded Policeman, and other popular comedies that challenge societal norms and political correctness, has a clever way of turning the focus of the viewer inward.  A powerful device, if you get it.\n\nOf course, there will also be people who will laugh just because of the way the Retarded Policeman says, 'Byeeeeeeee,' when a car drives off.\n\nEither way, though, it works.", "title": "Donuts (with Sandeep Parikh of The Guild) - Retarded Policeman #28", "publishedDate": "2012-09-20T16:00:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ZT1ivWpu68", "description": "A vodili su cijelu utakmicu i pobijedili, ali nema opu\u0161tanja", "title": "Trener Kazimir Ilija\u0161 - strah i trepet", "publishedDate": "2009-11-24T01:26:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ZT5F6UwW1A", "description": "The assisted hatching procedure involves thinning or making a small hole in the zona pellucida that surrounds the embryo (a protective layer).

I teach photography at the School of Visual Arts in New York.  These are a few good portrait photography tips.\n\nOne.  Cameras like this, they kind of want to force your hands into holding them horizontally.  People aren't horizontal, they're vertical.  Don't be afraid to turn the camera sideways and take vertical pictures.  That's the direction that people actually are.\n\nIf you're photographing outside, put your subject in the shade or photograph them on an overcast day.  Even the shade created by the side of a house or something is better than direct sunlight.  Direct sunlight makes people squint.  It creates big shadows on their face.  \n\nGet a little bit above their eye line.  Nobody thanks you for photographing them from underneath their chin.  You get 10 or 20 or 30 degrees above their eye line, everybody looks a little bit better.\n\nBring your chin up just a little bit, Syd.  Turn your head a little bit to the right.  \n\nHave them move through a variety of poses.  \n\nRoll your left shoulder back a little bit, Syd.  That's great.  Turn your head a little bit to the right.  Don't let that smile fade out.  There you go.  \n\nKeep your background fuzzy and indistinct.   Almost anything will work as a background if you keep it out of focus.  \n\nAnd those are a few good tips for taking better portraits.", "title": "3 Simple Tips to Make Pictures Better | Portrait Photography", "publishedDate": "2013-11-20T21:22:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ZbbrxGx1Nk", "description": "RTU Salud\nCon el Dr. \u00c1ngel Alarc\u00f3n B. - Cirujano General\n(099 463 648) - sumedicoamigo@rtu.com.ec\nM\u00e1s en: http://www.rtu.com.ec/", "title": "Su m\u00e9dico amigo: S\u00edntomas y signos de la diabetes", "publishedDate": "2011-01-18T16:36:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ZcBQz41bsU", "description": "Senator John Kerry, who has served Congress for nearly a few decades, remarked Saturday afternoon as debt negotiations stalled, \"I have never seen the governing process so broken.\"", "title": "Kerry: Republicans Have Broken Our Governing Process", "publishedDate": "2011-07-31T01:19:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ZcGHoKkdAc", "description": "", "title": "Baby is sick", "publishedDate": "2014-02-22T04:34:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ZcjWzXTHng", "description": "A brief introduction to cognitive load theory discussing attention, processing, and schema development.", "title": "Introduction to Cognitive Load Theory", "publishedDate": "2012-03-23T14:28:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ZcxFW9lVX4", "description": "IN THIS VIDEO A  VIEW  FROM THE  TOP  OF THE DUNES  LOOKING TOWARDS THE RAINFOREST  AND THE SURROUNDING BUSH VEGETATION  THAT  IS  IN CLOSE PROXIMATITY  TO  OLD  BAR PUBLIC SCHOOL ,WHICH THE  FEDERAL AND  NSW GOVERNEMENTS HAS SPENT AROUND 1MILLION DOLLARS  ON DOIN UP ,BUT WITH THE  EXTENT OF COASTAL EROSION  GOING  ON  HERE IN  OLD BAR  MID NORTH COAST  OF NSW AUSTRALIA ,PRETTY SOON  ,THEY WILL HAVEOCEAN VIEWS  TO VIEW  PERMINANTLY ,AND  NOBODY WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE  PROBLEM  HERE ,WHY  IS THIS SO ???", "title": "P3200165.AVI", "publishedDate": "2011-03-19T23:38:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Zcytv9YGAI", "description": "As you can see in the video I stripped out my reel when I hit this fish.

It was a tough job... I had one day to shoot footage for 3 clients and to assist in a fourth. Add to that the terrible weather that we experienced and, as you can imagine, I was not a happy camper on our way out to the dive site. I really hate not completing a shoot job and I was a little nervous about the narrow window of success that we had presented to us.\n\nWe turned up on site and despite the 3' waves and 15-20 knot winds the water was pleasingly clear and we got sharks almost immediately! We managed to shoot everything we needed in just a couple of hours and we returned home triumphant and a little baffled that it could be that easy!\n\nOne of the key components of a successful shoot like this is having the right gear, and that's where Snake River Prototyping came into play. I really wanted a flat port solution for the GoPros that would allow me to use filters and interchangeable lenses while still using the same housings topside. If you use the factory supplied flatport housing you end up having to carry double the gear and lenses just look rubbish.\n\nWilliam at AquaproHD supplied me with his Blurfix Lenses for GoPro. They are a really simple but super effective add-on to a stock GoPro housing that allows everything I wanted. I even discovered the added bonus of being able to fit my 55mm topside lenses to the housing. He also encouraged me to give 'The Tray' a test drive... check the video to see what that's all about.\n\nSuffice to say that I'll never go on a shoot again without SRP's gear in hand. It's quite simply indispensable.\n\nFind out more at:\nhttp://aquaprohd.com", "title": "GoPro Blurfix Lens demonstration - Filming sharks with Luke Tipple", "publishedDate": "2012-04-29T00:47:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_DQ1hfh3Mw", "description": "Collected a caterpillar wrapped in a giant ragweed leaf on July 13, 2010. \nThe pupa was quite active when (ever so slightly) disturbed .\nAdult emerged July 24, 2010.", "title": "Xenotemna pallorana", "publishedDate": "2013-02-10T15:59:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_EPa9Um__8", "description": "never heard this before. it is  bedtime so a brief work in progress.a few short cuts and adlib for now. love the emotionality of the song.\n\n\n\nIntro: A G C F (x2)\n\nAm                  G\nThrew a line out to pull you to me\nC                    F\nIf you don't get it, then you don't get it\nAm                    G\nYou made your mind up before you knew me\nC                    F\nIf you don't get it, then you don't get it\nAm        G\nTake my hand for a minute.\nC                 F            Am          G\nWe're in it - imagine all the pain that might be forgiven\n\nAm         F\nWhat if I had your heart?\nC            G\nWhat if you wore my scars?\nAm           F\nHow would we break down?\n        C               G\nWhat if you were me and what if I were you?\n\nAm          F\nWhat if you told my lies?\nC            G\nWhat if I cried with your eyes?\nAm           F\nCould anyone keep us down?\n        C             G\nWhat if you were me?

There have been huge corrections on some areas of the modern vacuum cleaner, and you will find a number of features that keep on as always. Listed here is a quick chronicle.\n\nThere was much question on who invented vacuum carpet. It is going to be easy to appreciate what shoppers had in their households and what did consumers use for carpet vacuuming in the 19th century. From the 1800s home owners emjoyed carpets and rugs to keep the dust away and keep dirt from getting tracked inside the residences. Their solitary means to dispose of the dirt and dust was to hang the area rug and thwack them with a branch. This stimulated the invention of a carpet beater which resembled a tennis racket.\n\nOne of the main recognized devices arrived in 1869 when Ives McGaffey invented an innovative solution to resolve the challenge of vacuuming the carpet, removing and beating the carpeting was not always an innovative resolution. He discovered a solution which would clean the carpet with fewer steps involved. He came up with a rug cleaner that  had rotating roller brushes, and supplied suction power. This was among the first prototype of a vacuum cleaner. Over time not much has altered the way vacuum cleaners have served.\n\n\nJohn Thurman was the person who built motorized vacuum cleaner in 1899. Alas, the initial vacuum cleaner was so gigantic that it had to be kept on a trailer outside the home with a pretty long cord run inside to do the sweeping. Melvin Bissell,  shortly became famous with their carpet cleaner that picked up dirt and pet hair and left it in a pan in back of the cleaner\n\nHoover developed in 1908 a vacuum that not only used a filter bag but also offered sweeping attachments and other parts. This vacuum weighed 40 pounds yet it was significantly more accepted. By 1926 Hoover had integrated a beater bar in its models that  meant the dirt would be swept away from the carpet and removed by the suction power. Replacement pieces were also for sale to change any part that got worn out.\n\nShortly, plastic vacuum cleaners were introduced and soon headlights were added onto vacuum cleaners to make them more popular. Upright vacuum sweepers hit the market in the 1950s. Self propelled vacuums became popular by the late 1960s. The decades since have resulted in vast transformations with vacuum cleaners.\n\nMore and more businessmen built new prototypes claiming to be the ultimate vacuuming machine. In 1907 James Spangler who was a janitor in the Ohio business invented an electric vacuum cleaner that  he shortly enhanced to involve attachments and a cloth outer container to enclose the dirt. \n\nCleaning might have come long way since it's first prototype but the principal design does indeed remain in vacuum cleaners in tens of millions of households surrounding the world thus leaving a great heritage of earsplitting clunky dirt gathering equipment behind.\n\nToday there are novel vacuum cleaners that you can buy that employ ultraviolet rays to kill mold viruses, bacteria, dust mites, and germs. Eventually better quality and much more vacuum cleaners and machinery will be used to help homeowners to own a sparkling house that could be free of microorganisms and uninvited fleas and ticks.", "title": "Vacuum Cleaner Tips And History For Pocatello Idaho Vacuum Cleaner Buyers", "publishedDate": "2013-04-01T20:06:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_I4Yk0imMM", "description": "FIFA 14 Coins from MMOGA: http://mmo.ga/6XSs\n\nSo.

Ischemia occurs when your blood cannot flow through your arteries as well as it should, and your intestines do not receive the necessary oxygen to perform normally. Mesenteric ischemia usually involves the small intestine, but it may also involve other intra-abdominal organs such as the colon, liver, and stomach.\n\nMesenteric ischemia usually occurs when one or more of your mesenteric arteries narrows or becomes blocked. When this blockage occurs, you can experience severe abdominal pain. Over time, often quickly, the blockage may worsen and cause tissues in your intestine to die because they lack enough blood flow.\n\nMesenteric ischemia usually occurs in people older than age 60. You may be more likely to experience mesenteric ischemia if you are a smoker or have a high cholesterol level.\n\nMesenteric ischemia can be either chronic or acute. Chronic means that you have had the condition and symptoms over a relatively long period of time. Acute means that the symptoms start abruptly and become very serious in a short period of time. Chronic mesenteric ischemia can progress without warning to acute mesenteric ischemia, sometimes very quickly.\n\nWhat are the symptoms? \nIf you have chronic mesenteric ischemia, you may experience severe pain in your abdomen 15 to 60 minutes after you eat. This pain can occur in any part of the abdomen, but most commonly it occurs in the middle to upper part. The pain may last for as long as 60 to 90 minutes and then disappear. Unfortunately, it tends to return the next time you eat. Many people with chronic mesenteric ischemia begin losing weight because, although they may feel hungry, they do not want to eat because they experience the pain.", "title": "Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T23:41:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_POVXtLDxI", "description": "\u041f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430", "title": "\u0433\u0443\u0440\u0442 \"\u0421\u0432\u0456\u0436\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0456\u0439\u043a\u0430\" \u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440-\u043d.flv", "publishedDate": "2010-08-01T21:18:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_POZm9MQTQ", "description": "ISIS is definitely interested in hitting the U.S. Could we be in for a Sept. 11th surprise?", "title": "MM55 - ISIS Researches Bubonic Plague Grenades", "publishedDate": "2014-08-30T21:30:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_PZ-Xg6o3Q", "description": "", "title": "Carcinoid Cancer Symptoms", "publishedDate": "2014-01-08T15:42:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_Pu1uhew_g", "description": "Visita http://www.vivavda.it per le descrizioni dettagliate delle aree naturalistiche della Valle d\u2019Aosta, i sentieri e le attivit\u00e0 proposte da VivaVdA.\n\nPercorso breve con tempo di percorrenza di 1,5 h che si snoda dai fabbricati di Ferr\u00e8re (dove \u00e8 possibile lasciare l\u2019auto) fino all\u2019alpeggio Arp-Damon.

To speed up performance, these skinning models typically employ a sparseness constraint, in which each 3D model vertex has a small fixed number of non-zero weights. However, the sparseness constraint also im- poses certain limitations to skinning models and their various ap- plications. This paper introduces an efficient two-layer sparse com- pression technique to substantially reduce the computational cost of a dense-weight skinning model, with insignificant loss of its visual quality. It can directly work on dense skinning weights or use example-based skinning decomposition to further improve its accuracy. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate that the introduced sparse compression model can significantly outperform state of the art weight reduction algorithms, as well as skinning decomposition algorithms with a sparseness constraint. It will be presented at SIGGRAPH 2013 (Anaheim, CA, July 2013) as a full technical paper.", "title": "Two-Layer Sparse Compression of Dense-Weight Blend Skinning (SIGGRAPH 2013)", "publishedDate": "2013-04-20T18:46:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9__I9I9-rsw", "description": "How To Induce Labor\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/thenivenulls Austin's Instagram: thenivenulls\nBritt's Twitter: https://twitter.com/#!/BrittNull Britt's Instagram: brittnull\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thenivenulls\nGoogle Plus: https://plus.google.com/103142539092031332460/posts?hl=en\nnivePhone Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/nivephone\nT-SHIRTS: http://thenivenulls.spreadshirt.com/\nBlogTV: http://www.blogtv.com/people/thenivenulls\nTinyChat: http://tinychat.com/thenivenulls\n\nWe're Kansas City based YouTube Partners!

Nat. Publication Date: 2011 Oct \nhttp://www.biomedsearch.com/nih/Deciphering-information-encoded-in-birdsong/21956026.html\n\nAbstract \nResearch on the function of acoustic signals has focused on high-amplitude long-range songs (LRS) and largely ignored low-amplitude songs produced by many species during close-proximity, conspecific interactions. Low-amplitude songs can be structurally identical to LRS (soft LRS), or they can be widely divergent, sharing few spectral and temporal attributes with LRS (short-range song [SRS]). SRS is often more complex than LRS and is frequently sung by males during courtship. To assess function, we performed two playback experiments on males of a socially monogamous songbird. We compared responses of males whose mates were fertile or nonfertile with differences in song structure (SRS vs. LRS and soft LRS), amplitude (SRS and soft LRS vs. LRS), and tempo (slow SRS vs. fast SRS). Males responded more strongly to SRS than to LRS or soft LRS, indicating that song structure had a greater effect on response than song amplitude. SRS tempo did not detectably affect male response. Importantly, males responded more strongly to SRS when their mates were fertile, presumably because hearing SRS can indicate that a male's mate is being courted by an intruding male and a strong response can deter extrapair competitors. We conclude that low-amplitude songs can function in both inter- and intrasexual communication and should receive greater attention in future studies of mate choice and male-male competition.\n\n- Loud, territorial song (wav):\nhttp://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/jinco-loud.wav", "title": "Junco hyemalis loud, territorial song", "publishedDate": "2011-10-06T12:46:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_f0M2uveG0", "description": "Petite musique qui fait bien rire pour partager notres amour pour les grosses fesses", "title": "Les grosses fesses by Pip and Boudet Show", "publishedDate": "2013-12-14T15:18:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_f5oFP-nUQ", "description": "A brand new song from hungarian death metal band Kill With Hate's upcoming album \"Voices Of Obliteration\"", "title": "Kill With Hate - Epistle Of Fire", "publishedDate": "2012-07-03T22:52:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_gHLLOi8tc", "description": "Thaiel hice este video  porque la verdad que  sos importantes para muchas chicas a las que no conoces pero ocupas una gran parte de nuestro corazon sos una gran persona  y cuando decimos te amamos es porque lo sentimos  gracias por ser asi espero sigas asi siempre, espero te haya gustado , te quiero mucho  cande", "title": "Thaiel uria  te amamos", "publishedDate": "2013-08-24T20:26:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_gdetRV79g", "description": "MP3: http://rapidshare.com/files/456025280/Satellite.mp3\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Felixs-Pianobar/361580252797", "title": "Rise Against - Satellite (Piano)", "publishedDate": "2011-04-05T17:04:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_gr17YnBxU", "description": "When is Holy Saturday in Mexico 2015\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nWhen is Holy Saturday in Mexico 2015\nSearch for When is Holy Saturday in Mexico 2015.\nFind Great Results on sthaniyakhoja.com!\nwww.sthaniyakhoja.com/When+is+Holy+Saturday+in+Mexico+2015\nWhen is Holy Saturday in Mexico 2015\nSearch for When is Holy Saturday in Mexico 2015\nFind Quick Results now!\nwww.sthaniyakhoja.com/When+is+Holy+Saturday+in+Mexico+2015\nWhen is Holy Saturday in Mexico 2015\nSearch for When is Holy Saturday in Mexico 2015.\nLook Up Fast Results now!\nwww.sthaniyakhoja.com/When+is+Holy+Saturday+in+Mexico+2015\nSearch Results\n\n    When is Easter Week in Mexico in 2015?\n    www.vercalendario.info/en/when/easter-week-mexico-2015.html\n    This page tells you when is Easter week and Holy week in Mexico in the year 2015. ...

Unlike other Gars, the mature Alligator Gar possesses a dual row of large teeth in the upper jaw. Its name derives from the alligator-like appearance of these teeth along with the fish's elongated snout. The dorsal surface of the Alligator Gar is a brown or olive-color, while the ventral surface tends to be lighter. Their scales are diamond-shaped and interlocking (ganoid) and are sometimes used by Native Americans for jewelry and arrow heads.\nAlong with its status as the largest species of Gar, the Alligator Gar is the largest exclusively freshwater fish found in North America, measuring 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.0 m) and weighing at least 200 lb (91 kg) at maturity. Kenny Williams, from Vicksburg, Mississippi, has broken the record for largest Alligator Gar ever caught using a net. [1] He caught the fish on February 14, 2011; it measured 8 ft 5 in (2.57 m) long, 327 lb (148 kg) in weight, and nearly 48 in (120 cm) around. The fish is believed to have been between 50 and 70 years old, wildlife officials said. Williams has donated the fish to the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science in Jackson where it will be on permanent display in the future.\nThe current world record for the largest Alligator Gar caught on rod and reel is 279 lb (127 kg).[2] The largest taken by bowfishing is 365 lb (166 kg).[3] The fish is also known for its ability to survive outside the water, being able to last for up to two hours above the surface.", "title": "Alligator Gar Sighting Lake Allatoona", "publishedDate": "2012-09-04T12:03:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_is2UuXIs0", "description": "Therm-a-Rest Compressible Pillow Overview", "title": "Therm-a-Rest Compressible Pillow Overview", "publishedDate": "2012-05-01T06:28:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_iz6WGqdAQ", "description": "", "title": "Philtre - \ubaa9\uc18c\ub9ac (Blending by \uc11d\uc724)", "publishedDate": "2014-03-06T10:04:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_juJCpqZdo", "description": "kleiner pisser mit cityroller!", "title": "kleiner pisser!", "publishedDate": "2011-03-12T18:12:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_k4MqalJMk", "description": "http://www.psychicreporter.com/\nThe Psychic Reporter visited Ian Cameron, Master Palmist and his wife Joanne, masseuse on Dangar Island.

It is Illumination Entertainment's first film. It was directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, based on an original story by Sergio Pablos.\n\nThe film stars the voice of Steve Carell as Gru, a super-villain who adopts three girls (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher) from an orphanage; and the voice of Jason Segel as Vector, a rival of Gru who steals the Great Pyramid of Giza. When Gru learns of Vector's heist, he plans an even greater heist: to shrink and steal the Earth's moon.\n\nThe film was animated by the French animation studio Mac Guff, which was later acquired by Illumination Entertainment.\n\nThe film earned positive reviews from critics, and grossed over $543 million worldwide, against a budget of $69 million. It launched a franchise with a series of films, including a sequel in 2013, to be followed by a 2015 spin-off film featuring Gru's Minions as the main characters, and Despicable Me 3 in 2017.\n\nToys around the world are called:\nArabic: \u0644\u064f\u0639\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629\nBrazilian Portuguese: brinquedo\nChinese: \u73a9\u5177\nCroatian: igra\u010dka\nCzech: hra\u010dka\nDanish: leget\u00f8j\nDutch: speeltje\nEuropean Spanish: juguete\nFinnish: lelu\nFrench: jouet\nGerman: Spielzeug\nGreek: \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\nItalian: giocattolo\nJapanese: \u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\nKorean: \uc7a5\ub09c\uac10\nNorwegian: leke\nPolish: zabawka\nPortuguese: brinquedo\nRomanian: juc\u0103rie juc\u0103rii\nRussian: \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430\nSpanish: juguete\nSwedish: leksak\nThai: \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\nTurkish: oyuncak\nUkrainian: \u0456\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\nVietnamese: \u0111\u1ed3 ch\u01a1i", "title": "Despicable Me 2 Deluxe Action Figure - Kevin with Jelly Blaster", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T21:00:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_kDrTffgI8", "description": "This is a ride a Hershey Park.

For centuries, an ancient truce has kept the na\u00efve citizens of the human race safe from the horrors of the invisible realm -- but that's all about to change, and fast. A ruthless leader has emerged in the invisible realm, a tyrant just as comfortable walking the surface realm as he is living in the land of fantasy. When this power-mad ruler defies his bloodline to assemble an unstoppable army of fantastical creatures that he will use to wage a supernatural war on humanity, it begins to appear that humankind's days are numbered. But Hellboy (Perlman) isn't about to stand idly by as the planet is purged by a demonic despot, and with a little help from his team at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, he may just be able to send our otherworldly overlords packing. Of course, Hellboy's pyrokinetic girlfriend, Liz (Selma Blair), is always willing to conjure up an inferno or two when things get desperate, aquatic Abe (Doug Jones) is prepared to dive headlong into any battle, and protoplasmic mystic Johann (voice of Thomas Kretschmann) proves an invaluable companion in times of inter-dimensional conflict. Now, as the creatures who inhabit the spiritual realm gear up for an all-out attack on the human plane, the only one capable of saving the Earth is a tough-talking hellspawn rejected by both worlds.\n\n\"hellboy 2 the golden army\",\"ron perlman\",\"doug jones\",\"selma blair\",\"guillermo del toro\",\"sci-fi thrillers\",\"action adventure\",\"action comedies\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",\"comic books and superheroes\",fantasy,\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi adventure\",\"lawrence gordon\",\"lloyd levin\",\"mike richardson\",\"chris symes\",\"john swallow\",\"mike mignola\",\"building videos\",liz,\"young hellboy\",\"abe sapien\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++357814,/m/04gv3y,/m/03hhd3,/m/01mqh5", "title": "Hellboy 2: The Golden Army (1/10) Movie CLIP - Attack of the Tooth Fairies (2008) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T13:25:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_sOjxzWlKU", "description": "June 13, 2014\n\nToday, I set out to locate A. fascicularis that was observed in 2008 located on More Mesa west of Santa Barbara.

Salvatore Spagnolo, published in the Book: Principles of Pulmonary Protection in Heart Surgery\nTitle: retrograde Pulmonary Perfusion for Pulmonary Thromboembolism\n\nMortality rates for pulmonary embolectomy in patients with acute massive pulmonary embolism have decreased in recent years. However, they still range from 30% to 45% when the surgery is performed on critically ill patients, and the rates reach 60% in patients who have experienced cardiac arrest before the procedure. The causes of death in these patients are generally attributed to right heart failure due to persistent pulmonary hypertension, intractable pulmonary edema, and massive parenchymal and intrabronchial hemorrhage. Clinical and experimental findings indicate that venous air embolism causes severe or even lethal damage to the pulmonary microvasculature and the lung parenchyma consequent to the release of endothelium-derived cytokines. These findings are similar to those observed when severely compromised patients undergo pulmonary embolectomy\u2014air entrapped in the pulmonary artery during embolectomy can lead to fatal outcomes.\nsee Book Chapter:Retrograde Pulmonary Perfusion for Pulmonary Thromboembolism\nSalvatore Spagnolo, Maria Antonia Grasso, Paata Kalandadze and Ugo Filippo Tesler\nPrinciples of Pulmonary Protection in Heart Surgery\n\n\n\n\nBesides enabling the removal of residual thrombotic material from the peripheral branches of the pulmonary artery, retrograde pulmonary perfusion fills the pulmonary artery with blood and prevents pulmonary air embolism. In this retrospective study, we analyzed a series of 30 consecutive critically ill patients in whom we applied retrograde pulmonary perfusion while performing standard pulmonary embolectomy. No patient died or experienced major postoperative complications. We believe that the use of retrograde pulmonary perfusion decreases morbidity and mortality rates associated with pulmonary embolectomy in critically ill patients", "title": "pulmonary embolectomy", "publishedDate": "2011-10-30T16:39:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_twh6s1E3I", "description": "Willie at KSC", "title": "More Armadillos at Cape kennedy Fl", "publishedDate": "2009-12-19T15:33:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_u5i3TEOuo", "description": "Lungfish, The Unanimous Hour: 08. \"Sands of Time\". \n1999, Dischord Records. \n\nAll rights reserved to the respective owners. \nIf you liked this album, please consider buying it.", "title": "Lungfish - Sands of Time", "publishedDate": "2011-10-08T04:13:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_uDcGDkEUs", "description": "Jugando al Bowling en Cabildo con Alvaro y Cotula", "title": "Bowling en Cabildo", "publishedDate": "2007-01-03T02:06:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_uK-kgeNFs", "description": "Great pass and equally great catch.

The reasons for this phenomenon has been accentuated in recent years are mainly the lack of rainfall and high temperatures and population growth, which brings the flow diversion of the Jordan River with the creation of aqueducts and reservoirs, like the National Aqueduct of Israel. This has led to the creation of wells on the shores of the Dead Sea and the lowering of its level (de-394m in 1960 to -423 in 2012), reducing its area a third of the original. The shuffling solution for this phenomenon is the creation of the Peace Canal, which would provide the necessary water from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea, measuring 180 miles long and 2 meters high. If it will not put any remedy, it is predicted that in 39 years it can dry completely.\nhttp://igeo.tv/\n\nWatch Video Syria, International Armed Conflict:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RzvCYF1eT8\n\nIgeo TV en espa\u00f1ol: ver videos, agencia de noticias y venta de metraje en: http://www.youtube.com/user/igeotv", "title": "Dead Sea drying up IGEO TV]", "publishedDate": "2013-10-10T18:16:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_vzpEdtLqY", "description": "A variety of species calling in the llanos habitat of central Venezuela.\n\nA list of taxa in order:\nPleurodema brachyops\nBufo (Chaunus) (Rhinella) granulosus\nEngystomops (Physalaemus) pustulosus\nLeptodactylus wagneri\nScinax ruber\nHypsiboas crepitans\nDendropsophus microcephalus\n\nLocation: \nHato Masaguaral\nGuarico, Venezuela", "title": "Frog Calls of the Llanos", "publishedDate": "2008-12-12T04:17:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_wCua6E6e8", "description": "common yellowthroat  Gwen Rhiwderin 19th march 2012", "title": "common yellowthroat.", "publishedDate": "2012-03-19T21:55:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_wLFbDw4ao", "description": "", "title": "vu dl , Dat Mendicity", "publishedDate": "2014-07-07T05:57:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "9_xZLvNNW7A", "description": "Group of Gray langurs in Panna National Park, India.\n\nGray langurs or Hanuman langurs, the most widespread langurs of South Asia, are a group of Old World monkeys constituting the entirety of the genus Semnopithecus. All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given full species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.\n\nGray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.\n\n\"Hanuman\" refers to the Hindu deity Hanuman.\n\nPanna National Park is a national park located in Panna and Chhatarpur districts of Madhya Pradesh in India. It has an area of 542.67 km2 (209.53 sq mi). It was declared in 1994 as the twenty second Tiger reserve of India and the fifth in Madhya Pradesh, Panna was given the Award of Excellence in 2007 as the best maintained national park of India by the Ministry of Tourism of India. It is notable that by 2009, the entire tiger population had been eliminated by poaching with the collusion of forest department officials.\n\nPanna National Park and the surrounding territorial forest area of North and South Panna forest division is the only large chunk of wildlife habitat remaining in North Madhya Pradesh in the otherwise fragmented forest landscape of the region.\n\nThe National Park is situated at a point where the continuity of the Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests belt, which starts from Cape Comorin in South India, is broken and beyond this the Upper Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests of the great Indo-Gangetic Plain begins. This area is the northernmost tip of the natural teak forests and the easternmost tip of the natural 'Kardhai' Anogeissus pendula forests.\n\nThe forests of Panna National Park along with Ken Gharial Wildlife Sanctuary and adjoining territorial divisions form a significant part of the catchment area of the 406 km (252 mi) Ken River which runs northeast for about 72 km (45 mi) through the park.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Always wear eye protection when playing Airsoft, even if you are just playing in your backyard.  Airsoft is non-lethal, no-one has ever been injured using these.

The festival is celebrated on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the dark fortnight of the month of Bhadra (August-September) in the Hindu calendar. Rasa lila, dramatic enactments of the life of Krishna, are a special feature in regions of Mathura and Vrindavan, and regions following Vaishnavism in Manipur. While the Rasa lila re-creates the flirtatious aspects of Krishna's youthful days, the Dahi Handi celebrate God's playful and mischievous side, where teams of young men form human pyramids to reach a high-hanging pot of butter and break it. This tradition, also known as uriadi, is a major event in Tamil Nadu on Gokulashtami. Hindus celebrate Janmashtami by fasting and staying up until midnight, the time when Krishna is believed to have been born. Images of Krishna's infancy are placed in swings and cradles in temples and homes. At midnight devotees gather around for devotional songs, dance and exchange gifts. Some temples also conduct reading of the Hindu religious scripture Bhagavad Gita. \n\nVrindavan alternatively spelled as Vrindaban, Brindavan, Brindavana, or Brundavan and also known as Vraj is a town in the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh, India. It is the site of an ancient forest which is the region where according to the Mahabharata, a grand Epic of Sanskrit literature dating back to the 3000BC, the deity Krishna spent his childhood days. Vrindavan is considered to be a holy place according to traditions of Hinduism. The major tradition followed in the area is Vaisnavism, and it is a center of learning with many Vrindavan Ashrams operating. It's a center of Krishna worship and the area includes places like Govardhana and Gokul that are associated with Krishna. Many millions of bhaktas or devotees of Radha Krishna visit these places of pilgrimage every year and participate in a number of festivals that relate to the scenes from Krishna's life on Earth. \n\nThe town is about 10 km away from Mathura, the city of Lord Krishna's birthplace, near the Agra-Delhi highway. The town hosts hundreds of temples dedicated to the worship of Radha and Krishna and is considered sacred by a number of religious traditions such as Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Vaishnavism, and Hinduism in general. Vrindavan has an ancient past, associated with Hindu history, and is an important Hindu pilgrimage site. One of its oldest surviving temples is the Govinda Dev temple, built in 1590, with the town founded earlier in the same century. It is believed that the essence of Vrindavan was lost over time until the 16th century, when it was rediscovered by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In the year 1515, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu visited Vrindavana, with purpose of locating the lost holy places associated with Lord Sri Krishna's transcendent pastimes. Chaitanya wandered through the different sacred forests of Vrindavana in a spiritual trance of divine love. It was believed that by His divine spiritual power, He was able locate all the important places of Krishna's pastimes in and around Vrindavana.\nIn the last 250 years, the extensive forests of Vrindavan have been subjected to urbanization, first by local Rajas and in recent decades by apartment developers. The forest cover has been whittled away to only a few remaining spots, and the local wildlife, including peacocks, cows, monkeys and a variety of bird species has been eliminated or are close to it. A few peacocks and monkeys can be seen found but cows are now only found in the goshalas of the Major Ashrams of Vrindavan.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

We have a model that will fill any conceivable requirement or budget.\n\nHere is a thumbnail summary of what is available.\n\nThe CS series is the most cost effective and the most popular.  Available from 1 Pico-Farad to 1000 Micro-Farads, with accuracies ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent, these rugged units are controlled by easy to use thumbwheel switches.  \n(show CS series page of website during this paragraph: http://www.ietlabs.com/capacitance/decade-capacitor/csbox.html )\n\nFor highest performance, calibration grade decade capacitors consider the HACS Z series (Say HACS as one word).  With a high accuracy of point zero 5 percent, these units provide any range of capacitance from 1 Pico-Farad to Ten Thousand Micro-Farads.  The zero capacitance is less than point 1 Pico-Farad and the temperature coefficient is better than 20 P P M per degree C.\n(show HACS-Z series Page: http://www.ietlabs.com/capacitance/decade-capacitor/hacs-z-series.html )\n\nThe GenRad 14 13 is the world's defacto precision decade capacitor, with similar performance to the HACS Z series but with a  range of 1 Pico-Farad to 1 Micro-Farad. The 14 13 has been the choice of the metrology community for decades.\n(Show 1413 Page: http://www.ietlabs.com/capacitance/decade-capacitor/genrad-1413-precision-decade-capacitor.html )\n\nThe GenRad 14 12, with an accuracy of zero point 5 percent, is another high performance capacitance decade but at a more economical price. It goes up to 1 Micro-Farad  while achieving high resolution by use of a variable air capacitor with 1 Pico-Farad dial divisions.\n(Show 1412 Page: http://www.ietlabs.com/capacitance/decade-capacitor/genrad-1412-bc-decade-capacitor.html )\n\nFor even a more economical option with a long proven history, consider the Gen Rad 14 19. Ranges are available from 100 Pico-Farads to 1 Micro-Farad with accuracies ranging from zero point 5 percent to 1 percent.\n(Show 1419 Series Page: http://www.ietlabs.com/capacitance/decade-capacitor/genrad-1419-series-decade-capacitor.html )\n\nThe unique GenRad 14 17 is the only choice when extremely high capacitances are required. It has 7 switchable values that go from 1 Micro-Farad up to the envelope pushing 1 Farad.\n(Show 14 17 Page: http://www.ietlabs.com/capacitance/decade-capacitor/genrad-1417-1-uf-1-f.html )\n\nThe Gen Rad 14 22 series variable air capacitors are the world standard when it comes to very low capacitance.

Newton generalized Kepler's Law to apply to any two objects orbiting each other.  In Newton's formulation the sum of the two masses equals the semi-major axis cubed divided by the period squared.  Thus if we can measure both the period of the orbit and the distance between the two objects we can get the sum of the masses, and if we can measure the distance of each star in a binary pair from the center of mass we can get the ratio of the masses.

Robert De Niro stars as Nick Wells, an aging thief whose specialty is safecracking and who is on the verge of retiring to a life of ease, running his jazz club and romancing his girlfriend Diane (Angela Bassett). But before he can ride off into the sunset, Nick is pressured to do one last job by his mentor and business partner, a flamboyant and extravagant upscale fence named Max (Marlon Brando). Max is plotting the heist of the Montreal Customs House, and he's got a man on the inside, Jackie Teller (Edward Norton), a talented but volatile crook who has managed to ingratiate himself with the facility's staff as a fellow employee suffering from cerebral palsy. Jackie bristles at Nick's interference in \"his\" score, however, and threatens violence when it seems he's going to be cut out of the action. In the meantime, Nick grows increasingly ill at ease about the operation, as it violates his two most important dictums in thievery: always work alone and never pull a job in your own city. The part of Max in The Score was written specifically for Brando by screenwriter Salem, although the improvisational star and his director Oz reportedly clashed during filming.\n\n\"the score\",\"the score clip\",\"the score trailer\",\"the score fugees\",\"the score part 1\",\"robert de niro\",\"edward norton\",\"frank oz\",\"jewel videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"crime dramas\",\"crime thrillers\",drama,suspense,thriller,\"roland pellegrino\",\"adam platnick\",\"betrayal videos\",\"deception videos\",\"disappointment videos\",\"karma videos\",\"mistakes videos\",\"rivalry videos\",\"car videos\",\"street videos\",\"nick wells\",\"jack teller\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++246685,/m/06cgy,/m/01515w", "title": "The Score (9/9) Movie CLIP - Switching Sceptres (2001) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-18T22:15:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "9aPp0NIshyU", "description": "Demonstrating the technique to hoist a spinnaker for fast downwind sailing on the single handed RS100 sailing dinghy from RS Sailing\n\nwww.rssailing.com", "title": "RS100 Sailing Technique - The Spinnaker Hoist", "publishedDate": "2010-11-02T23:39:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "9aPzwcKSpTY", "description": "Fortuna K\u00f6ln gegen Hansa Rostock \n\nEndstand 1:0 \n\nPyro von Rostock zum Anpfiff der zweiten Halbzeit.", "title": "Hansa Rostock Pyro gegen Fortuna K\u00f6ln", "publishedDate": "2014-09-25T07:57:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "9aQ0efrAee8", "description": "Reportage France 3 le Havre-Baie-de-Seine de Gwena\u00eblle Bron et Nagib Benghezala\nDiffus\u00e9 le 12 mai 2014\n\nInterviews de :\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me Le Banner\nMadjid Nassah (directeur d'Emergence - moniteur de boxe)", "title": "Reportage J\u00e9r\u00f4me Le Banner - Mai 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-05-14T18:28:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "9aQXcT71cw4", "description": "Watch the official music video for Aztec Camera - Crying Scene\n\nGet Aztec Camera music:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/aztec-camera/id829551\nAmazon: http://amzn.to/15HyvL7\nClick Here for More Aztec Camera Videos: http://bit.ly/1fD7FJB\nClick Here to Subscribe: http://goo.gl/G21T8", "title": "Aztec Camera - Crying Scene [OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO]", "publishedDate": "2013-09-13T19:10:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "9aQYeQgHo38", "description": "Common pipistrelle bats - Pipistrellus pipistrellus - swarming at a roost entrance before entering.

The game keeps the same idea of Outbreak, the player being one of a handful of survivors working to escape from Raccoon City before being overtaken by the T-Virus or eaten by zombies. But the game simply brings new and exciting locations to navigate through, from the forest and zoo, to returning favorites like the police station and Umbrella Labs. The gameplay style is also classic Resident Evil, with difficult camera angles and more of a focus on puzzles rather than combat.
