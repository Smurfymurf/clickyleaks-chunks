Even though a vote of two of the options may yield a consistent winner, it's impossible to achieve a consistent outcome between all three choices. Usually, a majority vote is taken on only two options, so whoever gets to choose which two options are on the table (known as the agenda setter) has the power to dictate the winner of the vote. \n\nIs this voting system fair?

Further developing a genre begun by Nicholas Kallikles, he wrote many occasional poems for a widespread circle of patrons at the Byzantine court. Some of the literary pieces attributed to him are unpublished, while still others may be wrongly attributed to him. Even so, there does emerge from these writings the figure of an author in reduced circumstances, with a marked inclination towards begging, who was in close touch with the court circles during the reigns of John II Komnenos (1118--1143) and Manuel I Komnenos (1143--1180). He was given a prebend by Manuel I, and he ended his life as a monk. Despite the panegyric and conventional treatment, his writings, often produced on some public occasion, provide important information on many aspects of contemporary Byzantine history. There is a strongly satirical vein in his works, which range from epigrams and dialogues to letters and occasional pieces in both prose and verse. He had a biting sense of humour, and his comments are shrewd and pithy.\n\nThe literary activity of Theodore Prodromos was vast and versatile, and there survive many of his writings in the literary Byzantine Greek language. Taking example by Heliodorus of Emesa's Aethiopica, he wrote a novel in verse, Rodanthe and Dosikles (\u03a4\u1f70 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u1fec\u03bf\u03b4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u0394\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1) in 9 books. The Battle of Cats and Mice (\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03c5\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) is a parody drama of the classical Greek tragedies, with dramatic roles for the mice. The action takes place off stage, and is related in two speeches by the messenger. A deus ex machina saves the mice from the housecat in the end. He also wrote \"Iambic and Dactyllic Quatrains on 293 Biblical Verses\". The Iambic quatrains are in the Vulgar Greek, and the Dactyllic quatrains are in the Homeric Greek. He also wrote two satirical poems, one against a lustful old woman (\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03cc\u03c2), and the other against an old bearded man (\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2). There also survives an astrological poem on the power and meaning of planets. The Verses on the Twelve Months (\u03a3\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b4\u03ce\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1 \u03bc\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2) are important for contemporary cultural history. Prodromos also wrote numerous occasional poems and epigrams, often on the occasion of some public event of historical significance, or for the purpose of begging for something; a few religious poems and treatises on the topics of theology, philosophy and grammar; dialogues written in the style of Lucian of Samosata; occasional speeches, epistles and many other writings.\n\nOne collection of four poems, written in the vernacular, has passed down to us under the name of \"Pt\u014dchopr\u00f3dromos\", however it has still not been established with certainty whether these poems were written by him or by someone who was imitating, or possibly even parodying, the true Theodore Prodromos. An attempt was made at resolving the problem of authorship by putting forward a hypothesis that there had actually been two poets of the same name. The evidence was found in one verse among the Ptochoprodromic writings, where the author praises the \"famous writer, harmonious swallow\", who was his \"friend and predecessor\". However, in distinguishing which poems belong to whom of the two poets, one comes across the unsurpassable obstacles. It was also suggested, without much evidence, that one Prodromos died in 1152, and the other in 1166.\n\nThe basic part of the Ptochoprodromic writings consists of five laments and begging poems, which are marked as ABCDE. The poem A laments over the poet's garrulous wife and calls for help from emperor John II Komnenos (r. 1118--1143). The poem B is addressed to a sebastokrator and begs for charity to improve the menu. The poem C, addressed to emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143--1180), relates a young monk's complaint over scandalous living circumstances in his monastery. The poem D is only a parallel of the poem C. The poem E describes a Byzantine writer.\n\nThe manuscripts signify that the author of these poems is a Prodromos, Theodore Prodromos etc. with further variations. One manuscript of the monastic satire (C) signifies that the author is Hilarion (Ptocho)prodromos, and this name is found again in the poem D. This name has always been identified with the famous novelist, poet and writer Theodore Prodromos, who wrote in purist Byzantine Greek.\" \n\n- quoted from wikipedia", "title": "To The Emperor", "publishedDate": "2014-07-17T00:19:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3wLMPbviyHY", "description": "\u5955\u5178\u5bf5\u7269", "title": "\u597d\u5927\u7684\u5f69\u87f2", "publishedDate": "2011-06-24T10:41:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "3wLXt6fv51Y", "description": "Forum Sitem : http://cepnoloji.com/", "title": "How to create Scatter Text For MTK SmartPhone", "publishedDate": "2012-12-27T21:40:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "3wLdbhNve2U", "description": "How to make paper wolverine claws using 6 peices of paper, scissors and tape!", "title": "How To Make Paper Wolverine Claws - Paper Claws", "publishedDate": "2014-11-07T17:44:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "3wM-VJYnJ68", "description": "Roger Baker, the CEO of Turf-N The World goes over our installation process as seen on DIY Extra Yardage.\nwww.turfntheworld.com\n\n1-855-TURFNIT", "title": "DIY Network Extra Yardage Turf-N The World - Artificial Grass", "publishedDate": "2013-02-04T22:26:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "3wMBbP92lmo", "description": "This video covers the basics of vitamin B7 biotin.", "title": "Biotin and Carboxylation", "publishedDate": "2013-05-24T13:12:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "3wMX5Uhdk3E", "description": "Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (Indian Orthodox Church) is one of the rare and oldest Churches in the entire Christendom, having rich and sound heritage, precious and vivid meaningful traditions and unique order of worship and rituals bind together in sacred and staunch faith. It could withstand so far so greatly with the immense grace and guidance of God Almighty. Many Churches across the globe which took birth at the time of our Holy church had been so influential and famous due to many reasons including the political importance of the land where they existed. But many of them have been wiped away from the surface of the earth and here arises the greatness enjoyed by our Holy Church. From the very inception of the Church in Malankara, it had been longing to be an ideal national Church and our church Fathers of the yester years were so particular to be identical to the national interests. In due course of time we have adopted many customs from the society and surroundings which are not at all harmful for our Christian dogmas and principles. When the foreigners came to India, one after the other, they longed to take control of the independent Church in India, and to dominate our church by their heads of the Churches in their home lands. The Portuguese who came in the 15th Century, the Syrians who came in the 17th Century and the English who came in the 19th century were not different. They all succeeded in dominating our Church for their hidden agendas. They all succeeded in alienating a number of faithful from the mother Church and to compel them to be obedient and faithful to the foreign Church heads. And it marked the division in the Church in Malankara. \n\nBy 2012, we will be blessed to celebrate the centenary of the re-establishment of the Catholicate in India. It is a rare and unique blessing for all the members of the Church of the present era. The Church leadership wisely decided to celebrate the event from now onwards.

Es justo decir que la mayor\u00eda de las personas experimentan uno o dos casos de agujetas o mialgia, por lo menos, en el curso de la vida. Muy a menudo las agujetas son causadas por el esfuerzo o el uso excesivo de un m\u00fasculo. Puede ocurrir en cualquier grupo de m\u00fasculos, en cualquier momento de la vida.\n\nComo quitar las agujetas y el dolor muscular - Remedios caseros para las agujetas\n\nLas agujetas o mialgia que no est\u00e1n causadas por la tensi\u00f3n del m\u00fasculo pueden estar presentes en un gran n\u00famero de enfermedades infecciosas, desde una gripe com\u00fan a enfermedades como la enfermedad de Lyme. Algunas enfermedades autoinmunes como el lupus y fibromialgia pueden causar dolor muscular importante.\n\nLas agujetas pueden ser leves, o pueden ser graves si se ha da\u00f1ado un m\u00fasculo. Cuando las agujetas aparecen sin estar relacionadas con una enfermedad y est\u00e1n presentes desde hace m\u00e1s de tres d\u00edas, se debe consultar a un m\u00e9dico. Esto es particularmente importante si se nota enrojecimiento o hinchaz\u00f3n alrededor de la zona dolorida.\n\nComo quitar las agujetas y el dolor muscular - Remedios caseros para las agujetas.\n\nLas agujetas por el uso excesivo de un m\u00fasculo se tratan siempre con la alternancia de pa\u00f1os calientes y fr\u00edos en el m\u00fasculo afectado. El masaje tambi\u00e9n puede ser beneficioso. El tratamiento puede incluir la toma de ibuprofeno, aspirina o paracetamol. El ibuprofeno y otros medicamentos antiinflamatorios no esteroideos son los preferidos, ya que pueden reducir la hinchaz\u00f3n. Sin embargo, el dolor de las agujetas es la manera en la que el cuerpo comunica que es necesario el reposo del m\u00fasculo. Si el medicamento se resuelve por completo el dolor, es posible experimentar a\u00fan m\u00e1s mialgia al continuar usando el m\u00fasculo o m\u00fasculos afectados.\n\nComo quitar las agujetas y el dolor muscular - Remedios caseros para las agujetas.\n\nEl ejercicio suave regular puede ser \u00fatil para aquellos que sufren de agujetas debido a estilos de vida sedentarios.

Es normal que al comenzar un r\u00e9gimen de ejercicios se puedan sentir agujetas despu\u00e9s de hacer ejercicio. Los m\u00fasculos que no han sido utilizados con frecuencia se llagan al principio.

The classroom style presentation covers five main areas: the basic practices, Islamic law, interfaith relations, spirituality and the Muslim contributions to modern civilization. Abdal Hakim Murad, a British convert fluent in Arabic, presents the material from a highly intellectual perspective and his style is unique to most of his other lectures since he is speaking to non-Muslim academics. His deeper exploration of the subject results in a series which any non-Muslim, new Muslim or life-long Muslim can appreciate and benefit from. These lectures are essential for any person or organization seeking to educate others about the true teachings of Islam. Some of the topics discussed: why Islam seeks to govern all aspects of life, tradition vs. modernity, the Qur'anic view of Jews, historical Muslim tolerance of Jews, the Qur'anic view of Christianity and Jesus, free will vs. determinism, the problem of evil, music as a spiritual healing, and Arab Muslims as a great maritime nation.

This is an important semiconductor being the third after silicon and germanium in terms of commercial use. Gallium arsenide is used to build microwave integrated circuits, light-emitting diodes, laser diodes, Gunn diodes, tunnel diodes, photo receivers and nuclear radiation detectors.Some gallium arsenide's properties surpass those of silicon. Gallium arsenide has a higher electron mobility. That's why it can operate at the frequency of up to 250 giga-hertz. Arsenide gallium-based semiconductor equipment generates lesser noise than silicon-based equipment at one and the same frequency. As gallium arsenide has a higher breakdown field intensity as opposed to silicon and gallium arsenide-based devices can operate at greater power. Such properties of gallium arsenide account for its wide utility in semiconductor lasers and individual radar systems. As compared to silicon-based equipment, semiconductor devices made of gallium arsenide are more resistant to radiation. That's why they are widely used in radioactive environment (for instance, in solar batteries installed in the space).Another benefit of gallium arsenide is that is a direct band semiconductor. Various optoelectronic equipment uses gallium arsenide, for example, light-emitting diodes or semiconductor lasers.Molecular beam epitaxy or MOC-hydride epitaxy techniques allow growing complex gallium arsenide lattice structures combined with aluminum arsenide or ternary solutions (heterostructures). Due to almost ideal lattice matching layers have a small mechanical stress and may be of any width.Physically, gallium arsenide is more fragile and less heat-conducting than silicon. Gallium arsenide bottom layers are much more difficult to manufacture and are five-fold more expensive than silicon one. Therefore, gallium arsenide is used less frequently.", "title": "GaAs Semiconductor", "publishedDate": "2010-11-30T05:24:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3wvqA0-FBA0", "description": "Like us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSickestFoos\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/TheSickestFoos\n\nThanks to \" SADIKBeatzTV \" for the instrumental\nhttp://www.youtube.com/SADIKBeatzTV\n\nWARNING: ALL OF THESE IRBON VIDEOS DO NOT HAVE INTENTIONS OF RACISM OR DISCRIMINATION.

So you're going to bring your soles of the feet together, like the binding of a book. And the knees can come into a little butterfly shape. Okay? So you're going to walk your heels in towards your inner groins as much as you can. And then once you're here, you can grab onto the feet. \n\nSo I've got blocks onto the side. So if your knees are up high, and you feel like you're using a lot of muscle to keep them there, no problem. You can use your blocks and rest them down, or drop your blocks down and give them, give them a little place to rest upon. Then you can go deeper into the hips that way, and you're not holding on to your groins. So you can have those, you can have those if you'd like. \n\nOtherwise you can grab ahold of the inner feet. And you're going to open the feet like a book, but you don't want to break the binding of the book. So the pinky side and the inner heel continues to press together. But you use your hands to aid in the knees falling closer towards the floor. And so you can stay with this process. Continue to grow from your hip to your armpit. So continue that place to grow. So nice and lifted. The low belly is scooping in and under, under or in and up.  So the low belly is squeezing in and up. And then you can open up your hands like that book. Keep that binding the way it is. \n\nAnd then start to reach your heart, up and over your toes. As though like a, like a big beach ball here. You're reaching your heart up and over your toes, and I like to press the elbows down into the legs. Extend the heart forward and press the elbows down into the legs. Again, heart forward. Exhale. And you can bring your nose down wherever it goes. An to come out, keep that flat back.

In 1942 in a Nazi concentration camp, Sholom was among 1600 Jews scheduled for mass execution. He received permission to sing the Keil Molei Rachamim (Prayer for the Dead) while the prisoners were digging their graves. The Nazi commandant, impressed with his voice, spared him to sing for the officers, and the next day he was allowed to escape, the only one of 1600 spared a brutal death.\n\nSholom Katz' phenomenal vocal range, his perfect control and dramatic quality are well displayed in his moving rendition of the Sabbath Services.

contacted error message when updating ios comment iphone software update server could not be contacted error message some iphone and ipad users who went to update to the latest version of ios using itunes may have discovered an error message saying the following the iphone software update server could not be contacted make sure your network settings are correct and your network connection is active or try again later while sometimes this error message appears because of local networking issues and you ll certainly want to be sure you re connected to the internet it s more often a sign that apple ios update servers are overwhelmed by requests as the error message suggests simply delaying to try again later typically resolves the problem and allows the itunes based update to function as intended this means you have four basic choices to get the ios update to kick off some of which still use itunes to update the iphone ipad or ipod touch and the other which uses the familiar ota update mechanism quit relaunch itunes then try again quitting and relaunching itunes to try again often works you may want to try that first wait a while simply waiting it out and then trying again almost always works this is recommended if you can be patient as the issues resolve themselves when requests to apple ios update servers settle down use ota update the on-device delta update mechanism is available on the ipad iphone or ipod touch through settings general software update use firmware pre-downloading the proper ipsw firmware file will get around the failed update server connection then you can update manually with that firmware file if you go this route you can always find the latest ipsw firmware here look for the appropriate version number and match it up to your device for most users simply having patience or going with the ota software update mechanism is preferable and very easy though the latter is sometimes impossible to update due to storage constraints and the itunes approach becomes a necessity enjoy this tip subscribe to the osxdaily newsletter to get more of our great apple tips tricks and important news delivered to your inbox enter your email address

in earlier versions i was able to install ios 8 2 just fine with software update though no problems with it after installing either itunes is good for playing music but really junky for managing ios hardware the new version is even worse than the last version at that too i would much prefer something like android file transfer where you have a simple drag drop interface to put music pictures etc on and off your iphone and a big obvious local backup button and that s it the syncing thing is totally annoying and overwrites data constantly learned that lesson long ago never use the itunes

Glass has a long relationship with the company, describing them as 'wonderful to work with... they seem to like these \"odd\" pieces of mine, and they do them very well. I think of my pocket operas as neutron bombs -- small, but packing a terrific punch'.\n\nGlass has won worldwide acclaim for his operas, which include Satyagraha and Einstein on the Beach. Music Theatre Wales gave a sell-out tour in 2010 of Glass's previous Kafka opera, In the Penal Colony, a work of blistering intensity and dark claustrophobia.

They assimilate to small town life while awaiting their orders, until one day, due to a sudden power shift in the North, their mission turns out to be an order to commit suicide. The film is based on the 2010 spy webtoon series Covertness by Hun, which has received over 40 million page hits. Upon its release on June 5, 2013, the film broke several box office records in South Korea: the highest single day opening for a domestic film, most tickets sold in one day for a domestic film, the biggest opening weekend, the highest-grossing webtoon-based film, and the fastest movie to reach the 1 million, 2 million, 3 million, and 4 million marks in audience number. Movie pundits attribute its success to a large percentage of teen audience turnout.

Its a 3 apple spindle; commercial apple parer built and stamped March 6, 1942.   Yes, this was most likely producing rations for our fighting men in WWII.  I found this in a warehouse in Ann Arbor, Michigan several years ago.  I bought it from the owner because I was absolutely amazed at that the intricacy of the cast iron pieces and the over all complexity of this machine.  Every cast iron piece has a part number on it.  Every piece is present and nothing is cracked or broken.  Less the motor, this machine is 100% complete with a wonderful old patina consisting of green paint, iron, and brass.\n\nI have cycled this machine by hand on several occasions for friends and to this day I am still in awe over the complexity and synchronicity of all the moving parts.  Im quite certain if you wanted to go into the business of peeling apples today, this would work for you!  It also has an adjustable leather slip clutch built in to prevent damaging the unit while operating.  Let me make this perfectly clear, this is not your grandmothers kitchen peeler.  This is a commercial grade apple parer manufactured by the Goodell Company of Antrim, NH, No. 665\n\nOver the years, I have entertained many friends and visitors by demonstrating and discussing this unique, intricate and perfectly balanced 80 lb machine.  It is worth its weight in entertainment value alone in addition to the historical significance of being built during the war time period of 1942.  .

Potassium Iodide is added to the petri dish in one end, and Lead Nitrate in the other end.

This is because of a substance with a high molecular weight diffuses more slowly than a substance with a lower molecular weight. This rule applies for any medium used, in this case water. Another good example of diffusion is why flatulence is able to smell up a room in seconds. Hydrogen sulfide (the substance responsible for the smell) has a pretty low molecular weight, and therefore diffuses faster. \n\nThis experiment serves as a good demonstration on diffusion, because of the difference in molecular weights, the insolubility of Lead Iodide in water, and the color of the precipitate.", "title": "Elementary Productions: Potassium Iodide and Lead Nitrate", "publishedDate": "2008-02-24T00:26:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "3xxFoUL7qnM", "description": "Waldorf Zarenbourg Demo Martin Herzberg", "title": "Waldorf Zarenbourg Demo Martin Herzberg", "publishedDate": "2014-11-06T18:03:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "3xxG2M8zbSo", "description": "Malgr\u00e8s un edit de no\u00ebl pr\u00e9vu annul\u00e9, Cl\u00e9ment Decotte et nous tous vous souhaitons un Joyeux No\u00ebl! \nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Arboretum-Skateboarding/213163818723374", "title": "Joyeux No\u00ebl!", "publishedDate": "2011-12-23T18:11:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3xxRg_E1kgg", "description": "How to check and measure the brake rotor/disc thickness  and how to find the minimum thickness value specified by the manufacturer in auto parts websites\n\nAuto, automobile, car, vehicle maintenance tools parts accessories engine mechanics do-it-yourself diy tutorial tuto \n\nThis video does not constitute or replace a real specialized technical manual, and was only made \u200b\u200bfor convenience and educational purposes. \"TutoBuild Eng\" makes no warranties of any kind and accepts no liability. \"TutoBuild Eng\" cannot be held responsible for any damage caused to devices or persons using information contained in this video.

Hickman (June 13,1886 - Jan.16,1930) was a drummer, pianist, and band leader whose orchestra is sometimes seen as an ancestor to Big band music. \n\nIt fits into what are termed \"sweet bands\", something like that of Paul Whiteman. His orchestra is also credited, perhaps dubiously, with being among the first jazz bands. One who disputed this notion was Hickman himself. At first he even disputed that \"jazz\" was music at all, alternatively calling it a kind of bubbling water or just noise. Although born in Oakland, he lived in San Francisco, California for most of his life.\n\nHis father had various jobs, but his mother had been in vaudeville. He had little to no musical training, but by 1913 he played piano and or drums for a San Francisco hotel. By 1914 he was leading a band which would sometimes be deemed a \"jazz band\", but he rejected the term as late as 1920 and possibly even later. He strongly associated jazz with African Americans, sometimes disparagingly and other times in a flattering way, which he was not. In 1917 he had one of his biggest successes with the song Rose Room, which was named after the hotel room. By the 1920s he had one of the, if not the, best paid band in the United States. He also was one of the first dance bands to have a saxophone section. In 1926 he did the Ziegfeld Follies.\n\nHe had intended to do a history of jazz, and also had other projects, but by 1929 he was suffering from Banti's syndrome. In 1930 he died.\n\n\nArt Hickman's Orchestra - Twilight the Stars And You (1925)", "title": "Art Hickman's Orchestra - Twilight the Stars And You (1925)", "publishedDate": "2012-11-05T06:30:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "3y0TyK-hlbA", "description": "Bocian Czarny - Ciconia Nigra   MARYSIA  FOTOGRAFUJE", "title": "Bocian Czarny - Ciconia Nigra   MARYSIA  FOTOGRAFUJE", "publishedDate": "2014-04-13T20:21:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "3y10nxcIqiI", "description": "View stream below!!!!!!\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/thecreatures/b/516343068\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/thecreatures/b/516343068\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/thecreatures/b/516343068\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/thecreatures/b/516343068\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/thecreatures/b/516343068", "title": "[ENDED] SIXTH Office Nova and Immortal Stream is LIVE", "publishedDate": "2014-04-02T02:17:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "3y2SKj-zFy0", "description": "RECURSOS GEN\u00c9TICOS. \nEn el proyecto se contemplan dos l\u00edneas de trabajo.

The first of them involves firstly, multiplying and characterizing meadow plants (trifolium, medicago, ornithopus, biserrula, plantago, etc.), lupines and medicinal plants (Plantago, chicory and Sanguisorba) collected in Extremadura and Alentejo in the previous RITECA project and introducing them into the corresponding Germplasm Banks. Secondly, it aims to value these collections through the evaluation and selection of the best lines, which will then be used as the basis for further work or projects. In the case of meadow plants and lupines these will help create better varieties which are better adapted to the southwest Iberian soil and climatic conditions.

\u00a0It's right at the center of our civilization of what it means to have a language and to use language. \u00a0My book is really designed to make people forget the myth of the Tower of Babel, which is an interesting myth and legend, but it's had some awful consequences these last few thousand years because the diversity of language, the diversity of different forms of speech isn't a curse. \u00a0On the contrary, linguistic diversity is the nature of language itself.\nLanguages are forever changing and we use language to define ourselves as groups, as entities, as clans, as families, as nations. \u00a0So rather than thinking of linguistic diversity as a nuisance, we should think about language from the very fact that linguistic diversity has always been part of the human condition and always will be, and therefore, for anything like a civilization to exist, some kind of inter-lingual communication has to happen and the translation is quite central to what it means to be human.\nI am much more attracted towards translations that happen at the same time or within the same generation as the originals and less interested, less taken by re-translations of the classics, those that people do later on to try and make the translation better, because I've always felt that there is something that you can never really get back to and that's the state of cultural knowledge and social relations that were prevalent at the time where it was written, and that the contemporary translator--even he--makes\u00a0mistakes or misses things out or gets a bit wrong, nonetheless he's got something there that we can never recapture and never pastiche and never pretend to write like an English aristocrat--Scottish aristocrat--of the 1920s.\nThe minimal requirement for a thing to count as a translation is that it says in the target language pretty much what the source says. \u00a0Short of that, it's not a full translation or perhaps not a translation at all, but that obviously isn't enough. \u00a0It has to get that message across in the translation, in the receiving text, in a way that is both respectful of the way it is expressed in the source and of the conventions and

Hop (Humulus lupulus), Pellitory-of-the-wall (Parietaria judaica) and Small Nettle (Urtica urens) are also used.  Adults feed primarily on Bramble (Rubus fruticosus), Fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica), Hemp Agrimony (Eupatorium cannabinum), Honeydew / Sap (), Ivy (Hedera helix), Privet (Ligustrum vulgare), Teasel (Dipsacus fullonum) and Thistles (Cirsium spp. and Carduus spp.).  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background. Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.\n See more: http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/species.php?species=atalanta\n\nFullvaxin fi\u00f0rildi lifa a\u00f0eins \u00e1 bl\u00f3masykri og ekki er \u00f3sennilegt a\u00f0 a\u00f0m\u00edr\u00e1lsfi\u00f0rildi (Vanessa atalanta) geti sogi\u00f0 bl\u00f3masykur \u00far bl\u00f3mum \u00e1 \u00cdslandi, s\u00e9rstaklega st\u00f3rum bl\u00f3mum \u00ed g\u00f6r\u00f0um.

Can you believe it's already day 40 of our 90 days? Amazing how fast time goes by when your busy/having fun!!!\n\nWe consider, Ardha Uttanasana a mini counter to Uttanasana. Mini because -- although it mildly counters the spinal flexion experienced during Uttanasana-- it does not counter the hip flexion, hence mini. \n\nFor beginners, I have noticed that they have a hard time finding full back extension in this pose. If you are a beginner, think back bend. Yes, back bend! You have got to open your chest and heart in this pose to counter the fold in Uttanasana. Lift the chest, look forward, draw your shoulders back, use your infraspinatus to externally rotate your hummers bone, use your rhomboids to retract your scapulae and the lower fibers of your trapezies to depress the shoulder blades. Open your heart! Now, do all this with a slight tuck of the chin to keep your cervical spine (neck) in happy alignment. Hehe, have fun! \u2665\n\nInfraspinatus: \nThe infraspinatus is one of four rotator cuff muscles. It spans the entire back side of the scapula, inferior to the spine of the scapula hence infraspinatus, and inserts into the the lateral superior portion of the upper arm bone (greater tubercle of the humerus). It is responsible for shoulder (glenohumeral) joint stabilization and biomechanics of the upper limbs. It externally or laterally rotates the humerus at the shoulder joint. \n\nRhomboids:\nThere are two sets of rhomboid muscles: rhomboideus major and rhomboideus minor. The rhomboid major commences on the thoracic spinous processes of T02 - T05 and stretch in a 45 degree angle downward to the medial border of the scapula. It performs scapula adduction or retraction. The rhomboid minor, sits superior to the rhomboid major and commences at the cervical and thoracic spinous processes of C07 and T01. With a slightly steeper angle it stretches down to the superior medial border of the scapula. Due to the natural downward sloping angles of both the rhomboids, they tend to not only retract the scapula but also slightly elevate, hence the need of the lower fibers of the trapezius.\n\nLower Fibers of the Trapezius:\nThe trapezius is a large muscle covering most of the upper back. It commences at the occipital bone as well as the spinous processes of T01-T12 and stretches laterally to the lateral third of the clavicle and superior border of the spine of the scapula. All the sections of the trapezius (upper, middle and lower) have different functions. The most important in this instance is the lower fibers, which perform scapular depression. Balancing the tendency of the rhomboids. Together the lower fibers of the trapezius and the rhomboids retract and depress the scapulas, which is actually the best way to release your upper trapezius muscle!!! #YogaAnatomy", "title": "Day 40: Ardha Uttanasana (Half Standing Forward Fold)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-08T17:41:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "3yFTysj-aW0", "description": "Dancefloor on chumed Cornflakes.\nwww.birds-venezuela.de und www.casa-vieja-merida.com", "title": "Wilsons and White vented Storm Petrel: Birdwatching Joe Klaiber", "publishedDate": "2012-06-26T22:08:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "3yFZy0aAzFA", "description": "\u300e\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30e4\u30c9\u30ab\u30ea\u300f\u4ea4\u5c3e\u524d\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\u884c\u52d5\u3092\u3059\u308b\u30af\u30ed\u30b7\u30de\u30db\u30f3\u30e4\u30c9\u30ab\u30ea\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30aa\u30b9\u304c\u30e1\u30b9\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u305a\u308a\u56de\u3057\u30d6\u30f3\u30d6\u30f3\u632f\u308a\u56de\u3057\u3066\u307e\u3059\u3002", "title": "\u300e\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30e4\u30c9\u30ab\u30ea\u300f\u4ea4\u5c3e\u524d\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\u884c\u52d5\uff14", "publishedDate": "2010-04-03T09:24:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "3yFvhDX46rc", "description": "", "title": "GOUACHE \u0413\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435", "publishedDate": "2012-12-13T13:54:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "3yG0KToONbQ", "description": "Watch Agent Gopi Movie Songs.

Our Lord once said to her: \"If anyone, being oppressed by sorrow . . . and grief, humbly and sincerely seeks consolation in thy words, he will not be deceived in his desires; for I, the God abiding in thee, urged by the liberality of My love and goodness, desire through thee to bestow much good on many.\n\n2. Whosoever commends himself with full confidence to thy prayers will obtain life eternal by thy mediation. Just as much as anyone hopes to receive from thee, so much will he surely obtain.\n\n3. Besides this, whatever thou shalt promise anyone in My Name, that I shall certainly grant him.\" [13]\n\n4. St. Gertrude received the most consoling promise that whenever anyone devoutly praises and thanks God for the graces bestowed on her, Our Lord will enrich that person with similar virtues and graces. And if this does not come to pass immediately, it will be fulfilled at an opportune time. On the page containing the Prayers of St. Gertrude you will find such a prayer of praise and gratitude.\n\n 5. Our Lord also promised her that no one who had venerated her would depart this life without having first received the grace of making his life pleasing to God, and that, furthermore, he would enjoy the comfort of a special friendship with God. Our Dearest Savior said to His beloved spouse: \"Just as I have now drawn in My breath, so shall I in truth draw to Myself all who incline toward thee with love and devotion for My sake, and I shall grant them the grace to make progress in virtue from day to day.\"\n\n6. Our Lord promised Gertrude that if anyone should praise and thank Him for the graces lavished on her, and ask for a favor, He would, in that love with which He had pre-elected her from eternity, assuredly grant the plea, provided it were for the eternal welfare of the suppliant. [14]\n\n7. Moreover, St. Gertrude received the promise that if anyone performs a good work in her honor, in union with that love in which God descended from Heaven and accomplished the work of our Redemption, he should obtain as his merit whatever is performed in honor of the Saint. No sinner who had loved and venerated her should die suddenly!\n\nSt. Gertrude once asked Our Lord for a sign as a solemn confirmation of these favors. \"Stretch forth thy hand,\" said Jesus. She did so. Immediately He opened the ark of His Deified Heart, and placed her hand in the Wound of His side. Then He said: \"Behold, hereby I promise to preserve inviolable the gifts I have bestowed on thee. If, however, according to My wise foresight, I suspend their effects for a time, I hereby bind Myself to recompense thee threefold, by the omnipotence, wisdom and goodness of the Triune God.\" When Gertrude withdrew her hand, she saw a golden circlet on each finger, and on the signet finger, three. \"Seven rings shall be to thee a certain proof that the seven favors I have promised thee for the salvation of the world have been ratified,\" said Our Lord.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "White man in korea eating ALIVE octopus for dinner!!!

What you're going to want to do is stabilize your shoulder blade down by either grabbing on to the bottom of a chair or sitting on your hand. I prefer to grab on to something if I can. You're going to tuck your chin back kind of giving yourself a double chin, turn your head towards your opposite shoulder, and look down towards your armpit. You should feel a stretch right along this back side of your neck. If you don't feel the stretch intensely enough, you can take your opposite hand, come over the back side of your head, and gently pull down. You want to hold that stretch 30 seconds to a minute.

Tara Cleary reports. It's called the Super Aegis 2 and its one of the most advanced weapons systems ever built. Billed by its manufacturers DoDaam of South Korea as a \"Total Security Solution\", the Super Aegis is an automated turret system that supports a variety of weapons, from a standard machine-gun to a surface-to-air missile. It is designed to repel an attacker from up to 3 kilometres away, using sophisticated thermal imaging software and camera systems to lock onto a human-sized target even in the dead of night. The system requires no human presence. It's all operated robotically from a distant control room. DoDaam Systems Vice-President Park Sung-ho says the high-tech weapon could become an integral component in South Korea's ongoing military face-off with North Korea across the heavily armed Demilitarised Zone. SOUNDBITE: DODAAM SYSTEMS VICE PRESIDENT PARK SUNG-HO SAYING (Korean): \"We have certain circumstance where North and South Korea are confronting each other and currently soldiers are operating a lot of military equipment. If the job can be replaced by non-human guarding and monitoring robots, it could reduce the number of labour forces and military forces. And it could also reduce human losses under real combat situations.\" Super aEgis 2 detects objects with two cameras: a low-light camera and a thermal imaging camera which senses body temperature. A laser range finder and gyroscopic stabiliser keep the weapon steady in high winds. SOUNDBITE: DODAAM SYSTEMS VICE PRESIDENT PARK SUNG-HO SAYING (Korean): \"Super aEgis 2 is a guarding, monitoring combat robot composed of a video part and a shooting part. The video part consists of a day and night colour camera, thermal camera, and Laser range finder which measures the distance. The shooting part consists of a section that uses the incoming image from the video part to detect the object and to destroy it.\" It's not yet clear though, whether the Super aEgis 2 will be deployed along the border. The 60 year old Armistice Agreement between North and South Korea specifies limits for the weapons each side can point at one another. The super gun's presence may never be known, unless or until it starts firing.

Cook spoke as part of his class reunion at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business.(www.fuqua.duke.edu)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAPPLE CEO AND FUQUA ALUM TIM COOK TALKS LEADERSHIP AT DUKE\n\nTim Cook spoke to students and alums when he returned for his 25th reunion\n\n\n\n\"Explore everything. Push the corners of your mind. Just get on this kind of continual learning roller coaster and see what happens.\"\n\nThis was among the advice Apple CEO Tim Cook shared with students at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business on April 26th. Back on campus for his 25-year reunion, Cook took part in an hour-long dialogue with Fuqua Dean Bill Boulding and the students in a jam-packed Geneen Auditorium buzzing with excitement to hear from the leader of the world's most profitable company.\n\nThe Apple CEO has embarked on a career far different than he had envisioned after graduating from Fuqua's Evening Executive MBA program in 1988. \"For me the journey was not predictable at all. You have to find your own north star and stay with your north star.\"\n\nAs 450 Daytime MBA students prepared to graduate, Cook advised the students to heed Abraham Lincoln's words of wisdom: \"I will prepare and someday my chance will come.\"\n\nCook shared the three keys to his leadership at Apple: people, strategy, and execution. \"If you get those three right the world is a great place.\"\n\nStudents were able to get a unique glimpse into Cook's motivation, inspiration and leadership role models. Raised in the south and a witness to racial injustice, Cook described his admiration for Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Junior's bravery in risking their lives to fight for what they believed in. He has just three photos in his office: two of Kennedy and one of King.\n\nCook was asked when to follow strict principles of business theory and when to break the rules. His response stressed the importance of risks and learning from failure. \"You should rarely follow the rules. What Fuqua teaches you so well is how to learn and how to collaborate. Write your own rules.\"\n\nThis message resonated with first-year MBA student Shelby Hall. \"I know this follows Steve Jobs' belief that Apple creates products which consumers didn't ever know existed,\" she said. \"It was interesting to hear Tim Cook's perspective on how we should balance writing our own rules while applying the foundations of business taught here at Fuqua.\"\n\nCook also spoke about some of his recollections from Fuqua. \"The people made it an incredible experience. It was great for me to see how bright people approached solutions in different ways.\"\n\nFirst-year MBA student Juan Danzilo says Cook's willingness to share his experiences shows a deep commitment to Fuqua. \"Tim Cook's presence reflects Fuqua's sense of community. His humility and eloquence is admirable. It certainly was a unique opportunity for MBA students to hear from such an inspirational leader.\"", "title": "Apple CEO Tim Cook on Ethical Leadership", "publishedDate": "2013-05-30T20:19:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ygar79oT9U", "description": "Once again, the Wunderkammer Handcar Regatta is again a big hit!

All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given full species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.\n\nGray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.\n\n\"Hanuman\" refers to the Hindu deity Hanuman.\n\nLandour, a small cantonment town contiguous with Mussoorie, is about 35 km (22 mi) from the city of Dehradun in the northern state of Uttarakhand in India. The twin towns of Mussoorie and Landour, together, are a well-known British Raj-era hill station in northern India. Mussoorie-Landour was widely known as the \"Queen of the Hills\". The name Landour is drawn from Llanddowror, a village in Carmarthenshire in southwest Wales. During the Raj, it was common to give nostalgic English, Scottish, Welsh or Irish names to one's home (or even to British-founded towns), reflecting one's ethnicity. Names drawn from literary works were also common, as from those by Robert Burns, Walter Scott, Thomas Hardy, Robert Louis Stevenson and many others.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

To us, he is the evil mastermind of the attacks on Mumbai and one of the accused in an Indian court for killings on the streets of Mumbai,\u201d said MEA spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin.\nHe noted that India has repeatedly asked Pakistan to apprehend Saeed so that he can be taken through normal judicial process.\n\u201cAlas! He has never been arrested on account of 26/11 ever,\u201d said Akbaruddin. Therefore, what the Pakistan HC said was true -- \u201cthat he is only free because he is a Pakistani citizen\u201d.\nThe MEA said that Pakistan cannot complain that it has not received enough evidence as an excuse for not prosecuting Saeed. \u201c99 per cent evidence in this case is in Pakistan. The entire conspiracy was hatched in Pakistan. The planning for this dastardly act was done in Pakistan. The financing for this act was undertaken in Pakistan and people involved who were involved in this were from Pakistan,\u201d he said.\nIt was upto to Pakistan to \u201censure that criminals like Hafiz were brought to book and justice was delivered.\u201d\nThe strong Indian reaction was in response to Basit\u2019s assertion that there was nothing wrong with Saeed remaining out of jail. \u201cHafiz Saeed is a Pakistani national so he is free to roam around. So what is the problem...he is a free citizen so there is no issue as far as Pakistan is concerned. Courts have already exonerated him. There is no case pending against him,\u201d said Basit.\nThe euphoria over Modi\u2019s invitation to Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif wore off within a few months, after India cancelled foreign secretary-level talks over the high commissioner\u2019s consultations with Hurriyat leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\nabc breaking news, bbc, bbc football, bbc iplayer, bbc news, bbc news america, bbc persian, bbc sport, bbc weather, bbc world news, breaking celebrity news, breaking election news, breaking late news, breaking local news, breaking music news, breaking news, breaking news alerts, breaking news canada, breaking news headlines, breaking news in atlanta, breaking news in nigeria, breaking news india, breaking news pensacola florida, breaking news plane crash, breaking news story, breaking sports news, business expensive news home media world, christian world news, cnn, cnn breaking news, cnn money, cnn news, cnn news breaking news, cnn news world, detroit breaking news, global news, headline, headline news, health care technology news, hot latest global news, internet technology news, las vegas breaking news, latest breaking news, latest celebrity news, latest information technology news, latest music news, latest news, latest news headlines, latest news update, latest sports news, live breaking news, local breaking news, local news today, msn breaking news, nbc breaking news, nbc world news, news of the world, news report us world, news today news, news updated daily, solar technology news, sports news today, technology news, the latest news, today news, us news and world, us news and world report, us news and world report magazine, us news and world report web site, us news world report, world news, world news daily, world news headlines", "title": "INDIA PAK  War of WORDS over HAFIZ  SAEED    WORLD  BREAKING NEWS 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-16T01:06:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "3yqPhAGkTug", "description": "In this Tech Tip video from the Indoor Air Quality Association (http://iaqa.org), you'll learn about cockroach allergens, which can trigger allergy symptoms even if cockroaches are not seen.", "title": "Cockroach Allergen", "publishedDate": "2014-01-27T17:40:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "3yr9JIfHCnc", "description": "Use this slim, lightweight housing as a spare or replacement for your HERO3 or HERO3+ camera.

While openly weeping, he told Judge Elinore Marsh Stormer that he feels as if he \"can't get any kind of justice.\" \"Just execute me. ... I'm tired of it,\" Thompson said. The appearance Wednesday at the Summit County Court of Common Pleas was intended to be a final opportunity for the defendant's new attorneys to file any additional motions.

The term woman is usually reserved for an adult, with the term girl being the usual term for a female child or adolescent. However, the term woman is also sometimes used to identify a female human, regardless of age, as in phrases such as \"women's rights\". Women are typically capable of giving birth from puberty onwards, Throughout history women have assumed various social roles in occupation. In some cultures, a majority of women have adopted specific appearances, such as those regulated by dress codes.\nWomanhood is the period in a female's life after she has passed through childhood and adolescence, generally around the age 18.\n\n\n\nVenus, a classical image of youthful female beauty in Western art.\nThe word woman can be used generally, to mean any female human, or specifically, to mean an adult female human as contrasted with girl. The word girl originally meant \"young person of either sex\" in English;[7] it was only around the beginning of the 16th century that it came to mean specifically a female child.[8] The term girl is sometimes used colloquially to refer to a young or unmarried woman, however during the early 1970s feminists challenged such use because the use of the word to refer to a fully grown woman may cause offence. In particular, previously common terms such as office girl are no longer widely used. Conversely, in certain cultures which link family honor with female virginity, the word girl is still used to refer to a never-married woman; in this sense it is used in a fashion roughly analogous to the obsolete English maid or maiden. Referring to an unmarried female human as a woman may, in such a culture, imply that she is sexually experienced, which would be an insult to her family.\n\nThere are various words used to refer to the quality of being a woman. The term \"womanhood\" merely means the state of being a woman, having passed the menarche; \"femininity\" is used to refer to a set of typical female qualities associated with a certain attitude to gender roles; \"womanliness\" is like \"femininity\", but is usually associated with a different view of gender roles; \"femaleness\" is a general term, but is often used as shorthand for \"human femaleness\"; \"distaff\" is an archaic adjective derived from women's conventional role as a spinner, now used only as a deliberate archaism; \"muliebrity\" is a neologism (derived from the Latin) meant to provide a female counterpart of \"virility\", but used very loosely, sometimes to mean merely \"womanhood\", sometimes \"femininity\" and sometimes even as a collective term for women.\n\nMenarche, the onset of menstruation, occurs on average at age 12-13. Many cultures have rites of passage to symbolize a girl's coming of age, such as confirmation in some branches of Christianity, bat mitzvah in Judaism, or even just the custom of a special celebration for a certain birthday (generally between 12 and 21), like the Quincea\u00f1era of Latin America.\nSOURCE:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman", "title": "FUNNY WOMEN DOING BARON", "publishedDate": "2014-05-17T06:16:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "3yteIWuHPqA", "description": "", "title": "Notropis chrosomus", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T20:00:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "3yuBk250v9E", "description": "Motivationevent 2014 by thaddeus koroma . \nearly birds fly to www.tkinspiration.com      \nand all the long sleepers go to \nhttp://de.amiando.com/goforit.html", "title": "GO 4 IT 3014 - thaddaeus koroma", "publishedDate": "2013-12-10T20:44:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "3yu_3u6J_FU", "description": "Medley degli Abba cantato alla quarta puntata di Colorado il 16/05/2013\nhttp://www.facebook.com/GemBoyOfficial\n\nTESTO:\nChe storia brutta brutta andiamo a raccontarvi\ndi una bionda con occhi blu\nLady Oscar non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 come la conoscevi tu\n \nDopo cinque bambine mi ero rotto i maroni\nvolevo un erede maschio con i pantaloni\nMa nata \u00e8 lei e come un maschietto l'hai allevato\nio dirtelo non vorrei temo tu \"abba\" esagerato\nTutto il giorno guarda la TV\nsporca in giro non ne posso pi\u00f9 uho oh oh oh\nBimba mia presto torna in te\nLevati, c'\u00e8 il Paris Saint-Germain\nMa lei \u00e8 Oscar e ogni Oscar...rafone\n\u00e8 bello a mamma soja\n \nCiao sono Andr\u00e8 mi dai un bacetto?\nAl massimo con te potrei giocare a calcetto \nDiciamo che non sei proprio un mostro di finesse\nla tua femminilit\u00e0 l'hai buttata gi\u00f9 nel cess\nrutti e poi passi il tempo con il tuo Gameboy \n \nDimmi dimmi dimmi se indossi anche i boxer\ne di Maria Antonietta in casa hai il poster\ndimmi dimmi dimmi se fai la ceretta\ne fai pip\u00ec in piedi per fare pi\u00f9 in fretta\n \nGrande festa alla corte di Francia\nKiss me Licia ha portato due amiche\nLady Oscar con abile mossa se le far\u00e0 tutte e tre\nOh Lady Lady Oscar ma che strani gusti chi lo sa perch\u00e9\nOh Lady Lady Oscar ti fai Maria Antonietta anzich\u00e9 il Re\n \nPap\u00e0 la colpa \u00e8 tua se mi sento \"madamigello\"\nAndr\u00e8 se vuoi io per te sar\u00f2 sempre come un fratello\nquindi sai non abbatterti \u00e8 inutile ormai\npiangere sul latte Versailles\n \nVaffanzum, Oscar cos\u00ec non ci piaci pi\u00f9\nVaffanzum, l'Oscar non lo vinci sicur\nVaffanzum, la regina per te ha perso la testa\nse sei gi\u00f9 prendi una Bastiglia ed \u00e8 subito FESTA!!\n \nSe vi piace chiamatemi...

This is being done under the Department of Energy's Openness Initiative. The film project is being carried out by DOE's Albuquerque Operations Office (AL) in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).\n\nComing out of World War II, the U.S. and its allies realized they were in a Cold War with the Soviet Union. The first atomic bomb had been tested successfully at the Trinity Site in southeastern New Mexico in July 1945 and the second and third bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in August 1945, bringing about a speedy end to World War II. U.S. officials knew that the Soviet Union was on a fast track to develop the \"bomb\" and that they must develop more sophisticated nuclear weapons to stay ahead of the Soviet Union in the Cold War.\n\nWith the backing of the Executive Branch and Congress, the Army's Manhattan Engineer District (MED), which designed, developed and tested the first atomic bomb, embarked on a nuclear testing program in 1946 at the newly established Pacific Proving Ground in the Marshall Islands area. The MED was dissolved in 1947 and its duties and functions were given to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). The DoD joined the AEC in Joint Task Forces which continued the atmospheric testing program. This program allowed rapid gains in knowledge about weapons development, military effects, fallout and radiation effects, biomedical science, nuclear science, and delivery systems.\n\nAL, a field office of the AEC, opened the Nevada Proving Ground northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1951 to reduce the cost of nuclear testing. The cost of transporting supplies, scientific gear, and materials for housing and testing, and for keeping a work force in the Pacific was monumental. The name of the Nevada Proving Ground was changed in 1957 to the Nevada National Security Site.\n\nIn hindsight, the AEC and the DoD made many mistakes in the testing program, such as underestimating the effects of fallout and deploying troops in areas of excessive radiation. Despite the errors in the early testing efforts, the U.S. surged ahead of all other nations in nuclear weapons capabilities, and gained the expertise which now sets the standard for what is \"safe.\"\n\nAlthough the Soviet Union mounted a massive attempt to gain a distinct advantage in nuclear military power, the U.S. maintained a deterrent to nuclear aggression. The U.S. now has a smaller but more sophisticated nuclear weapons stockpile, which the DOE manages jointly with the DoD. Through treaties, nuclear testing has been discontinued.\"\nhttp://www.nv.doe.gov/library/films/film.aspx?ID=66", "title": "Nuclear Testing on Bikini Island", "publishedDate": "2013-08-16T18:00:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ywGur-6d4k", "description": "Song: Taste Of My Scythe\nArtist: Children Of Bodom\nAlbum: Follow The Reaper\n\n------------\nLYRICS\n------------\n\nRip and cut and mutilate the innocent,\nhis friends, and again and again and on and on.\n\nYou make me own my life in Hell; my kingdom back to the bound\nYou say you don't make it alone; kingdom back to the Lord\n\nFalling, I say; you too, falling; you too, born to die\n\nCome with hate\nCome and die\n\nOne day I'll face you all alone,\nenduring out with wind and ice\nIt's payback time; it's your demise sought to feel:\nthey'll taste of my scythe\n\nYou say my ear, my God who help me, God take yours in shame\nBack too low, I want your head on a plate to feel my eyes\n\nCome with me, I want your blood to save it on my eyes\nI want you and in the plate to be coming in the sky (sky!)\n\nCome with hate\nCome and try\n\nOne day I'll face you all alone,\nenduring out with wind and ice\nIt's payback time; it's your demise until they feel:\ntaste of my scythe", "title": "Children Of Bodom - Taste Of My Scythe [Lyrics]", "publishedDate": "2009-07-08T00:12:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ywOyYpFcO0", "description": "Ogl\u0105daj nas w ka\u017cd\u0105 niedziel\u0119 o godzinie 20.00 w Polsacie.\n\nDo\u0142\u0105cz do nas:\nSubskrypcja - http://tiny.pl/qkq2b\n\nCo nowego w Tylko Muzyka.

The world of Fullmetal Alchemist is based in the countries of Europe during the Industrial Revolution period as well as several experiences from the author's life. Set in a fictional universe in which alchemy is one of the most advanced scientific techniques known to man, the story follows Edward and Alphonse Elric, two brothers and alchemists, who want to recover parts of their bodies they lost in an attempt to bring their mother back to life.\n\nThe manga is serialized in Square Enix's Monthly Sh\u014dnen Gangan magazine and was adapted into an animated television series and a movie sequel. The manga is still running in Japan, and nineteen bound volumes have been released so far, while sixteen have been released in the United States by Viz Media. The anime, on the other hand, is finished, and consists of fifty-one episodes and a full-length movie sequel, which have been released in English in all English-speaking DVD regions. In addition, there are several spin-off novels, original video animations (OVAs), and video games. Merchandising of Fullmetal Alchemist, such as collectible card games, action figures, soundtracks, and supplementary books, have also been released.\n\nThe franchise has seen high popularity in both Japan and North America. As of March 2008, the Fullmetal Alchemist manga has sold over 30 million volumes in Japan. The English release of the manga's first volume was the top-selling graphic novel during the year 2005. The series' animated adaptation won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize in 2003. In two TV Asahi web polls, the anime was voted #1 most popular anime of all time in Japan. It was nominated in six of the eight categories for which it was eligible at the American Anime Awards in February 2007, winning awards in five of them.\n\nSource: wikipedia.org", "title": "Full Metal Alchemist OST 1 - Scar", "publishedDate": "2008-07-23T22:39:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "3zGs5z6A-IQ", "description": "", "title": "The Syrian refugee crisis in numbers   animation", "publishedDate": "2013-07-29T16:17:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "3zGx98fuR4I", "description": "pf: Georges Cziffra\n\nPlease visit my new blog! http://tomekkobialka.blogspot.com/", "title": "Cziffra \"Tritsch-Tratsch Polka\" Transcription Audio + Sheet Music", "publishedDate": "2009-02-01T19:22:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "3zHBYufXojo", "description": "", "title": "Mediterranean Sea snail zoom in", "publishedDate": "2011-09-08T22:21:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "3zHdzzk3ztk", "description": "Subscribe Now:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ehow\n\nWatch More:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/ehow\n\nTeaching your dog good manners is all about toleration.

Martins addressed the audience from the stage, saying \"We came here to dance, it is what we do, but our hearts are breaking and it is simply not possible for us to perform this evening.  But we will be back tomorrow, and we will be honored to perform for all of you then.\"\n\nNYCB did perform at the Teatro Reggio the following evening, September 12th, 2001, and 12 years to the day after, New York City Ballet offers NEW BEGINNINGS, which features an international team of collaborators, including director Davi Russo who was born and raised in New York City, British choreographer Christopher Wheeldon, American dancer Maria Kowroski, Danish dancer Ask la Cour, and a ballet set to a score by the Estonian composer Arvo Part, which provides a moving backdrop to a film of profound and powerful beauty.", "title": "NYC Ballet Presents NEW BEGINNINGS", "publishedDate": "2013-09-12T10:29:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "3zMJuMCnvhM", "description": "Drunk guy puking", "title": "Drunk Guy Puking", "publishedDate": "2010-07-25T05:34:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3zNGREQd_JQ", "description": "The 6th esper battle.

The Congo River divides the native habitats of the two species:\n\n-    Common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes (West and Central Africa)\n-    Bonobo, Pan paniscus (forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n\nChimpanzees are members of the Hominidae family, along with gorillas, humans, and orangutans. Chimpanzees split from the human branch of the family about four to six million years ago. Chimpanzees are the closest living relatives to humans, being members of the Hominini tribe (along with extinct species of Hominina subtribe). Chimpanzees are the only known members of the Panina subtribe. The two Pan species split only about one million years ago...\n\nThe genus Pan is part of the subfamily Homininae, to which humans also belong. These two species are the closest living evolutionary relatives to humans, sharing a common ancestor with humans about four to six million years ago. Research by Mary-Claire King in 1973 found 99% identical DNA between human beings and chimpanzees, although research since has modified that finding to about 94% commonality, with some of the difference occurring in noncoding DNA. P. troglodytes and P. paniscus have been proposed to belong with H. sapiens in the genus Homo, rather than in Pan; e.g., by J. Diamond in his book, wherein he refers to man as The Third Chimpanzee. Among the arguments in favor of this reclassification is that other species have been reclassified to belong to the same genus because of less genetic similarity than that between humans and chimpanzees...\n\nChimpanzees live in large multi-male and multi-female social groups, which are called communities. Within a community, a definite is the position of an individual and the influence the individual has on others dictates a definite social hierarchy. Chimpanzees live in a leaner hierarchy wherein more than one individual may be dominant enough to dominate other members of lower rank. Typically, a dominant male is referred to as the alpha male. The alpha male is the highest-ranking male that controls the group and maintains order during disputes.

Thanks to its extremely high content of unsaponifiable matters (between 12% and 18%), it gives tone and elasticity to skin and therefore provides the ideal remedy for abdominal and breast stretchmarks, which are often an unpleasant consequence of pregnancies and weight loss.  It is very useful for expectant mothers in the prevention of sore nipples and it can  also be used for the very delicate skin of newborn babies in alleviating the redness and soreness caused by the discomfort of nappy rash.  Its emollient properties benefit hard skin on feet and hands and also alleviate the suffering caused by bed sores, besides being an excellent ally in the cold weather too.

Do you feel like the only stability left is change? Why are we here, and where do we go from here?\nIn this book, we explore key aspects such as politics, economy, education, art, nature, the role of women/motherhood, etc. and bring them under the light of the Initiatic understanding of renowned Initiates, Sages, and great Masters, particularly Omraam Mikha\u00ebl A\u00efvanhov.\nHumanity is coming to the end of an era of materialization and is at the threshold of a new era, one of spiritualization. We are at a crossroads. Our awakening and cooperation as a global family, a universal family, are the surest way to face the twenty-first century.\nThis book is an opportunity to see with new eyes, with a new consciousness. The future can be harmonious and glorious. May we open up, go within, and explore our inner riches, the ones deposited by the Creator in the depth of our soul!\nThe exercises of visualization and affirmation at the end of each chapter are a way to uplift your consciousness to a new realm, that of universal love and cosmic light. Enjoy!\nI am frequently asked in lectures and seminars, Who today is a believable, genuine, spiritual teacher?

So there are several\ndifferent types of eyeliner brushes that you could use for this. There's\nthe pointed slant. So it kind of has a slanted brush and it's very pointy\nup here and firm. That makes it easy for you to apply because you can kind\nof come in at an angle. You can angle the brush however it works for you.\nThat one is really simple.\n\nYou could also use just basically a fine-tip eyeliner brush. This one is by\nBobbi Brown. It's very thin, makes it really easy to see what you're doing.\nYou can easily get a nice cat eye wing with this one. Or you could use the\nflat eyeliner brush. It's very flat, very firm. There are also angled\nversions of this that the bristles will be kind of cut at an angle. That's\neasy as well.\n\nToday, I'm going to show you how to do this with the second brush that I\nshowed you, the ultra-fine brush, and I'm also using the Bobby Brown Black\nInk pot liner. So, what I like to do when I'm applying cream liner is take\nthe brush, coat this evenly on both sides, then I kind of just do a little\nscrape on the side here to make sure everything is even. You don't want any\nclumps. You want it to go on very smoothly and flawlessly.\n\nSo now that my brush is loaded, I'm going to go ahead and when you're\napplying this you want to start as close as possible to the lash line. You\ndon't want any spaces between your lashes and where the liner is, and there\nare different looks that you can do. I'm going to start with just a very,\nvery simple lash look where I'm just kind of wiggling the brush and it just\nmakes the lashes look a little bit thicker.\n\nSo I'm going to take it in, just like I said. I'm laying the brush flat and\nit's so simple. You just kind of place it right on the lash line. You don't\nhave to think about drawing a line at first. You can just kind of wiggle\nthe brush back and forth right on the lashes. You don't have to get crazy\nthinking that it's not perfect. So, just kind of place it right on top.

One of the ads in the program says, when the arts are healthy, a society is healthy and that's an expression I think comes off very well with this show. Anyone who has seen any musical productions and dance productions- I'm not trying to put myself up, but anybody who has seen as many productions as I have realize that this is at a very high level. I also appreciate that everyone involved with it is a very high level professional: the dancers, the musicians, obviously, the stage, the directors: very high level of professional attainment.\"\n\nBeing a musician he took special notice of Shen Yun's Orchestra and the unique mixture of classical western and classical Chinese instruments.\n\n[Douglas Cornelsen, Clarinetist, Detroit Symphony Orchestra]:\n\"I like the way that the composers have deliberately taken modern orchestral music and traditional ethnic music and ethnic music from various parts of China and put them together in a way that is able to be choreographed very well with the dancers.\"\n \nMr. Cornelsen spoke of the show's deeper inner meaning and values behind the show's cultural essence. \n\n[Douglas Cornelsen, Clarinetist, Detroit Symphony Orchestra]:\n\"I think it's fabulous. I would like everyone in the world to see this show. I also liked the way this show concentrates on values of humanity, peace cooperation, very good values, very good thoughts. I think everyone should see it. I like it because ethnic music and ethnic art, ethnic dancing, is becoming more and more rare in the world and it's so fabulous to see an absolutely top-notch presentation of ethnic art. Its really wonderful ... I would say don't miss it. It's unique, There's no other show like this and it's a wonderful presentation.\"\n\nShen Yun will be wrapping up its 2013 production's 4-show run in Detroit this weekend.\n\nFor more news and videos visit  http://ntd.tv\nFollow us on Twitter http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook  http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "\"Terrific, wonderful, artistic expression\" Detroit Symphony Orchestra's Clarinetist on Shen Yun", "publishedDate": "2013-01-29T02:20:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "4-Js4WMI5V0", "description": "", "title": "Updating the Firmware on an Asus Router", "publishedDate": "2013-12-06T23:47:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "4-JsyNNJqZg", "description": "Camera\uff1aCanon EOS M", "title": "[HD 1080p]Purple-faced langur / \u30ab\u30aa\u30e0\u30e9\u30b5\u30ad\u30e9\u30f3\u30b0\u30fc\u30eb", "publishedDate": "2013-07-31T12:00:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "4-JvTrtg5M0", "description": "azu-pastor-andres.. parcela de eucalipto, schinus molle y oreja de negro...\nelementos de silvicultura 2008ii... vivero forestal UNALM", "title": "vivero forestal parcela", "publishedDate": "2008-11-22T00:07:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "4-L3USbE7GM", "description": "Our promotional stemless champagne flutes from ARC are top quality glassware items to have at your busy hospitality business.

In his laboratory he observed with a high performance microscope that diseases dissolve under selective sound radiation and body tissue gets healthier. The human body is approximately 73% water and the tones have positive effects on the information memory of this water molecules. This slight changing of the elements of life works similar to homeopathy as coding of the energy field of a person.\nWhat's special about the NRT is the use of the laboratory sounds of Dr. Rife as musical-harmonic titles.

In seinem Labor beobachtete er mit einem Hochleistungsmikroskop, dass sich Krankheiten bei gezielter Klangbestrahlung aufl\u00f6sen und K\u00f6rpergewebe ges\u00fcnder wird. Der menschliche K\u00f6rper besteht ungef\u00e4hr zu 73 % aus Wasser und die Klangschwingungen wirken positiv auf den Informationsspeicher der Wassermolek\u00fcle. Diese geringe Ver\u00e4nderung der Bausteine des Lebens funktioniert \u00e4hnlich wie Hom\u00f6opathie, als Codierung des Energiefeldes einer Person.\nDas Besondere an der Nordwest Resonanz Technik ist die Verwendung der Laborkl\u00e4nge von Dr. Rife als musikalisch-harmonische Titel. Die Videoversion enth\u00e4lt zus\u00e4tzlich Farbresonanzen, basierend auf den neuesten Erkenntnissen der Licht- und Farbenforschung. Begeisterte R\u00fcckmeldungen vieler Menschen aus aller Welt zeigen die Wirksamkeit dieser Methode.\n\nAnwendung\nTesten Sie die kostenlosen Videoausschnitte und dann bestellen Sie die hochqualitativen Originaltitel auf CD oder DVD.

Is this propaganda based on facts or are some politicians spreading canards for electoral gains. \n\nThe most common allegation is LPG price will double once gas prices are increased. Nothing can be far from truth. LPG can neither be made nor is being made from KG D6 gas. Gas from these fields contains 99.9% pure methane (natural gas) and does not have any Propane and Butane which are used to make LPG. Therefore there cannot be any correlation between LPG prices and increase in natural gas prices. \n\nThis can be further corroborated from the fact that for the last five years natural gas price have been constant but the price of LPG cylinder has increased from approx. Rs. 280 to approx. Rs.450 for 14.2 kg cylinder. If there was any correlation between natural gas and LPG prices, then why have LPG cylinder prices increased while natural gas prices have remained constant?\n\nObviously, the sole purpose of perpetuating these lies is to scare the consumers. Most of the LPG is produced in refinery from crude oil it has no correlation with natural gas prices. \nThe second lie that is being perpetuated is that with a hike in gas prices from April 1, the cost of food grains are set to increase. However, the fact is that trucks, tempos and tractors that transport goods use diesel and not gas, so how will increase in gas price impact these costs?\n\nThese people do not want to share truth; you are being misguided to garner votes.
