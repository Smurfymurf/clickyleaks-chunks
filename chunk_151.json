Chromosome abnormalities have been associated with birth defects, mental retardation, infertility, pregnancy loss, hematologic disease and cancer. Prenatal cytogenetic analysis has become the standard of care for those patients at increased risk because of advanced maternal age, abnormal maternal serum screen, abnormal ultrasound findings, or a family history of birth defects. Many characteristic chromosome abnormalities have been associated with specific hematologic diseases and their identification provides prognostic and diagnostic information. Molecular cytogenetic techniques, especially fluorescent in situ hybridzation (FISH), have become an important adjunct to classical cytogenetics. Several chromosomal syndromes (e.g. Williams, Miller-Dieker and DiGeorge/ Velocardiofacial syndromes) have been identified that are at or beyond the limits of standard chromosome methods, and diagnosis is incomplete without both karyotype analysis and specific FISH assays. Using DNA probes, FISH allows for more sensitive and specific identification of gene sequences in interphase and metaphase cells.", "title": "\u062d\u0644\u0642\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u0636 crom disease \u0645\u0639 \u062f\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0631\u0627\u0644\u0641 \u0639\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a 5", "publishedDate": "2008-10-08T17:54:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "8XFD17HMAL8", "description": "This animation was created by KO Studios Medical Illustration and Animation for AMP Orthopedics, Inc.(http://amportho.com) in order to demonstrate the MOA of Amp's innovative, patented non-thermal pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) technology and to outline its benefits in post-surgical wound healing.\nAward of Excellence recipient from the Rx Club in 2012\n\u00a92012 KO Studios; http://www.kostudios.com/", "title": "Pulse Radio-Frequency Mechanism of Action", "publishedDate": "2012-10-25T18:35:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8XFf1bTXD7Q", "description": "Live at the Wunderbar", "title": "Stripped..Christianne", "publishedDate": "2008-04-03T16:51:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "8XG6CmQ0koQ", "description": "", "title": "pradeep yadav,dance style hiphop, formS.S Sanskritic Nitrya Kala kendr aligarh", "publishedDate": "2012-05-31T03:38:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "8XGDWcwIRRQ", "description": "just another way for me to be pushed aside\njust for you i refuse to be silenced\nIf you had your way \nyou'd do anything you could to destroy me\nyou keep on making strikes\nbut we've built us an army\n\nchorus\nAnd we're deep in this fight\nin the middle of the battle\nwe're fighting with truth\nall you've got is ignorance and a gavel\nwe've got to stand up\nthey'll hold us down if we'll let them\nfrom now on love is our weapon \n\ngo on man you're a mental slaveholder don't you notice\ninstead of educating \nyou breed hate and cowardice\nall we ask for is a little bit of acceptance \nso we can live on and love the world without arrest\n\nchorus \n\nbridge\ni am loving and embracing free of judgement and impatience  you are hateful but love defacing\nthe value of human life that may be different all your time spent discriminating based on sacrament but what are you thinking isn't all about LOVE", "title": "Austin Jennings - LOVE is our only weapon", "publishedDate": "2010-09-23T00:43:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "8XGDlvM6Oxg", "description": "Lololoollo", "title": "Muumuu", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T18:17:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "8XGIQR_SLdM", "description": "Jim Burns of the ECBC Decontamination Engineering Branch, describes the mission to support the decontamination needs of U.S. government agencies with a focus on Acquisition and Sustainment and decontamination of the Armed Forces.

But it was the dark brown, seemingly tacky substance on the lower palm of Pineda's pitching hand that quickly became the focus.\nClose-up camera shots clearly showed Pineda (1-1) pitching for the first four innings with something on his hand, and there was speculation it was pine tar to help him get a better grip on a chilly night. The game was never stopped for an umpire to examine him, and it was gone by the fifth.\nPineda said it was merely dirt, rubbed on his sweaty right hand in-between innings.\n\"No, I don't use pine tar. It was dirt,\" he said.\nYankees manager Joe Girardi said he didn't see anything on Pineda's hand.\n\"I really don't have anything to say on the subject,\" he said.\nRed Sox manager John Farrell said that he found out about the substance only after Pineda's hand was cleaned up.\n\"It was not there by the time I was aware of it,\" he said.\nPineda (1-1), making his first Yankee Stadium start 27 months after he was acquired from Seattle, took a two-hit shutout into the seventh and appeared completely recovered from the shoulder surgery that sidelined him for two years. Throwing at up to 95 mph, he allowed four hits in his first Yankees' win, struck out seven and walked two.Brian McCann ended an 0-for-14 slide with a run-scoring single that put the Yankees ahead during a two-run fourth in the first of 19 games between the rivals this season.\nMaking just his third big league start, Dean Anna homered as New York made it 4-0 in the fifth.\nAfter spending nine years in the Red Sox organization and winning World Series titles in 2007 and last year, Ellsbury left for a $153 million, seven-year contract with the Yankees. And his first game put him at the plate against Buchholz (0-1), his roommate at Lowell of the New York-Penn League in their first summer of professional ball.\nEllsbury grounded out in the first inning, reached on an error and scored the game's first run in the fourth, singled sharply to left to drive in a run in the fifth, and grounded out in the eighth.Daniel Nava led off the seventh with a home run into the second deck in right, and Xander Bogaerts' single chased Pineda.\nWith David Robertson on the disabled list and Shawn Kelley and Adam Warren unavailable after pitching Wednesday, the Yankees scrambled their bullpen. Cesar Cabral and David Phelps retired Boston's last nine batters -- striking out five -- and Phelps got seven outs for his first career save.\nBuchholz was sharper than in his opening start against Milwaukee, giving up four runs -- two earned -- and seven hits in six innings with six strikeouts and no walks.\nBoston went 13-6 against New York last year, its most wins against the Yankees since 1973. While the Red Sox won their third title in 10 years, New York failed to make the playoffs for just the second time in 19 seasons.\nEllsbury reached leading off the fifth when Jonathan Herrera appeared to look up while fielding his grounder to third and allowed the ball to pop out of his glove for an error. With Herrera moved between second and first on a shift, Carlos Beltran singled between the third baseman and second baseman Dustin Pedroia, into right field.\nMcCann lined a single past Mike Napoli about 2 feet fair down the first-base line, driving in Ellsbury, and Alfonso Soriano hit a double-play grounder to shortstop that brought in a second run.\nAnna opened spring training wearing No. 93 after six minor league seasons with San Diego, which traded him to New York in November, started at second base as Brian Roberts got his first day off. Now wearing a more respectable No. 45, Anna homered to right on an 87 mph splitter, his first in the big leagues after hitting 40 in the minors.\nGame notes\n\n\nDerek Jeter went 2 for 4 with a double, raising his average to .290. ... The Yankees employed an unusual shift with Grady Sizemore up: Jeter remained at shortstop and rookie Yangervis Solarte moved from third to the first-base side of second; Sizemore grounded out to Solarte in the third. ... Red Sox CF Jackie Bradley Jr. sprinted into left-center to catch Beltran's two-out drive in the fourth with Jeter on second. Nava sprinted in to make a sprawling grab on Solarte's fly to right leading off the third. ... CC Sabathia (1-1) is slated to face Jon Lester (0-2) on Friday.\nCopyright by STATS LLC and The Associated Press", "title": "Yankees Pitcher Michael Pineda Cheating with Pine Tar (Yankees Michael Pineda cheating)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-11T03:20:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "8XNtIhk99ZY", "description": "Allthingslushuk.blogspot.com", "title": "The Sparkler Ballistic (Lush Halloween 2014)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-06T04:49:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "8XPKYW8b31w", "description": "The first track to play during the end credits of Wes Anderson's \"Grand Budapest Hotel\" (2014)\n\nI do not own this song.

The purpose of the ACL is to keep the knee stable, to keep it from twisting or bending in an unnatural way.  Unfortunately, because it is located in the middle section of the knee, the ACL is the easiest knee ligament to injure.  Any twisting injury in which force is exerted from one side of the knee to the other has the potential to partially or fully tear the ACL.\n\nIf you have sustained a torn ACL or other knee injury in any kind of serious accident in Oregon and don't know what comes next, call the experienced personal injury attorneys at Dwyer Williams Potter Personal Injury Attorneys at 888-247-9023.

You may be interested in something called the raw food diet or looking to make most of the foods in your diet completely raw, being uncooked or unprocessed. Keep in mind that this type of diet has not been proven to have great benefits, not has there been much medical literature actually proving the benefits. Also know that sometimes cooking processes can actually help certain nutrients and minerals be more available to our body. And when you're looking at the raw food diet, be aware of the different processing you will have to do to these foods, such as the blending or mashing. Sometimes this, just as cooking, can deteriorate certain nutrients. Also keep in mind, they may b deficient in some things such as, B twelve, the omega three fatty acids, and even calcium, just because of the outline of the diet. You may have to actually supplement these back in to your diet as they re very key components to a regular metabolism and daily life living. Also be aware, that the calcium is probably going to leech from your bones when you have that rapid weight loss that you may experience at the beginning of this diet. So again, supplements may be a good idea depending on how complete your raw diet is. For more information on the raw food diet, check out EatHappy.info. I'm Charlotte, and eat happy.", "title": "luther movie diet of worms | diet books for diabetics | diet food for dogs", "publishedDate": "2012-11-14T11:15:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "8XpL4p0biKk", "description": "Download Funny Movie Maker from the App Store:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/funny-movie-maker-replace/id430623298?mt=8", "title": "Fickleness having a party in his mouth", "publishedDate": "2014-07-23T06:21:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "8XpSW4-_ucc", "description": "Watch more How to Pick a Birth Control Method videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/510817-Birth-Control-Sponge-Side-Effects-Birth-Control\n\nLearn how safe and effective a birth control sponge is in this Howcast video.\n\n\nThe sponge is a product that is soaked with a spermicide. This spermicide soaked product is pushed as far into your vagina as possible before you have sex. After you have sex, you need to keep the sponge in for a few hours before you remove it, in order to reap the contraceptive effectiveness. \n\nIn general, the sponge is not as effective as other over-the-counter birth control options. If you use the contraceptive sponge perfectly, you get a better form of effectiveness. However, nobody's perfect. In some studies, one in four women who use this form of birth control will get pregnant with each use. So keep that in mind. It's 75 percent effective, and it doesn't prevent sexually transmitted diseases. \n\nIf you are considering using birth control that is not prescribed by a nurse practitioner or a physician, the sponge is not the best option. Please consider using condoms, at least until you can get a better birth control option for you. And by the way, condoms are an excellent form of birth control. You don't need to see a doctor. You don't need to tell anybody that you're using anything else. You can just use the condoms. Everybody's happy. And it also prevents sexually transmitted diseases. \n\nSo, please, the sponge, while it is convenient in some ways, it is not as effective as using condoms, and it does not prevent sexually transmitted diseases. So I reiterate. Use condoms, and if you don't like using condoms, use them until you can get to your doctor or your nurse practitioner, and then discuss your birth control options in more detail.", "title": "Birth Control Sponge Safety & Effectiveness | Birth Control", "publishedDate": "2013-07-13T02:25:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "8XpmWNOgaS4", "description": "Tree Top Jaunt Swap Zone Challenge - Skylanders Swap Force with 3 stars.

It's definitely a lot less expensive than using gum paste flowers. There are a few caveats. You don't want to use heavily sprayed flowers. You want to go through a respectable florist who's going to tell you the truth if these are organic. It's great to buy them from a food vendor, as well. They'll tell you exactly what's on there.\n\nRose's are actually edible. They taste a little bit like celery. I don't recommend eating them. So what I'm going to do instead of putting these directly into the cake where they could potentially leach out some of the moisture, and leave behind a strange aftertaste, what I'm going to do is put together a ball of fondant-ish. No one's going to see this part, so it's okay if it's a little oddly formed.\n\nAnd I'm going to press this down into the seam area and this is what my flowers are going to go into instead of the cake. So I'm not going to leave any holes or any weird flavors. I have some needle-nosed pliers here. Actually, I always travel with three or four pliers. Do I need that many pliers? Yes, people tend to walk away with them, so it's good to always have some spares. \n\nI'm just going to plunge this in. It should go up to the base of the flower. I like to work in three's at varying angles, not more. We'll probably get a couple more in on this guy. There we go, I'm going to crunch this, and let's do one up over here. There we go, so obviously that looks a little bit strange. We want to add some fillers. \n\nThis is a Monte Casino, little daisy looking flower. You could use Baby's Breath, that would be lovely. You can use the needle-nosed pliers. Luckily, these are kind of woody, so they're going in for me really easily, and you want to put fresh flowers into your cake as close to the wedding as possible. This isn't something you want to do ahead of time. They will wilt and look very sad on your wedding cake.\n\nThere we go, looking cute already. If you are working with smaller flowers, you can add a smaller bunch of fondant to put your flowers on to it with. I like to do more than just the one. So I'll do a smaller version on the top right here. Roses are snipped very close to the end and we'll just keep on adding these until our brown is filled in. That is how you put fresh flowers on your wedding cake.", "title": "How to Decorate with Fresh Flowers | Wedding Cakes", "publishedDate": "2013-06-17T14:14:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Y-zgsuQS-A", "description": "Kristine Sward, twenty-five, of Woodbury, explains why you should vote for her as Mpls.St.Paul Magazine's next real model.", "title": "Kristine Sward", "publishedDate": "2009-02-03T21:39:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Y0JAu-RV34", "description": "The Hairy Bikers start their epic 5,000-mile bakeation in Kristiansund on Norway's stunning west coast.

And the proportion of people using or being a designated driver has increased dramatically over time. 2 Each year over 73,000,000 Americans either serve as a designated driver or are driven home by one.\n\n\nThe non-drinker has a legitimate and respected role at a social function where alcohol is served. There is no stigma to abstaining because the designated driver is considered an important member of the group. Being a designated driver can also help legitimize a personal choice not to drink.\nThe designated driver approach prevents driving under any level of impairment because that person consumes no alcohol. It doesn't require a driver or passenger to determine if a person is too impaired to drive.\n\n\nThe server or host can offer a positive alternative to drunk driving by encouraging a group to designate a driver.\nThe designated driver concept is easy to understand, simple to implement, costs nothing, and is effective.\n\n\n\nIn addition to being or using a designated driver, you can save lives by taking car keys from intoxicated people to prevent them from being drunk drivers.\n\nHere are some helpful hints on how to get the keys from a drunk person about to drive:\n\nBe calm. Joke about it. Make light of it.\nMake it clear that you're doing the drunk person a favor.\nLocate their keys while they're preoccupied and take them away. They will probably think they've lost them and will be forced to accept another mode of transportation.\nIf it is a close friend, try to use a soft, calm approach. Suggest to them privately that they've had too much to drink and it would be better if someone else drove them home or if they took a cab or other transportation.\nIf it's a good friend, spouse, or loved one, tell them that if they insist on driving, you are not going with them. Tell them that you will ride with someone else, take public transportation, or walk.\nIf it's someone you don't know well, speak to their friends and have them make an attempt to persuade them to hand over the keys.\nIf possible, avoid embarrassing the person or being confrontational. 8", "title": "Drunk Driving PSA 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-04-14T16:15:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YCMnN0MNsc", "description": "Subscribe to Blanco y Negro and get the latest updates - http://bit.ly/1kbB3g8\nListen to our latest hit: http://smarturl.it/ByNRecommends\nSpotify  Blanco y Negro Music: http://spoti.fi/TdEXLn\n\nBuy It On/ C\u00f3mpralo:\niTunes: http://bit.ly/1r0q5uD\nGoogle Play: Coming Soon!\nBeatport: http://btprt.dj/1k73cXN\n\nListen/ Esc\u00fachalo:\nSpotify: http://spoti.fi/1oaXHT5\nDeezer: http://bit.ly/1rFHp8D\n\nSigue todas nuestras novedades/ Discover new videos: http://smarturl.it/BYNSub\nDisfruta de nuestra mejor m\u00fasica / Enjoy our best HITS: http://smarturl.it/ByNHits\n\nbooking@blancoynegro.com\n34.93.2254400\n34.689126647\n\nLicensing: alex@blancoynegro.com\n\nCHECK US OUT ONLINE:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/blancoynegromusic\nhttp://twitter.com/blancoynegro\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/blancoynegro\nhttp://www.blancoynegro.com/\n\nBlanco y Negro Music is the leading dance music record company in Spain, welcome to the official YouTube homepage for non stop dance!!\n\nBlanco y Negro Music es la compa\u00f1\u00eda discogr\u00e1fica independiente l\u00edder en Espa\u00f1a, bienvenido a nuestro canal oficial en YouTube para que no pares de bailar!!", "title": "Semitoo & Marc Korn Feat.

These are really sweet and simple projects. We're going to be using three different sized embroidery hoops. Some nails and a hammer to put them on the wall. \n\n   * Glue \n   * Scissors\n   * 3 types of fabric\n\nYou might want to embroider your hoops or if you don't know how to embroider or don't have the time. You can find a fun fabric you really like. Vintage chenille blankets give me a lot of inspiration and are a lot of fun to work with. I'm going to use the chenille fabric for the largest hoop. So pull the hoops apart, using the interior hoop. I'm going to place glue around the outside of the interior hoop. Once you've gotten all the way around the hoop. Take your chenille fabric and lay it over the hoop. Now using other outside hoop, loosen it all the way up. We're going to plan where we're going to put it. Usually the screw goes at the top. I'm going to try and make sure my pattern is vertical and even. Then press on my hoop. Then I'm going to gently tighten it just a little bit. Using my fingers to pull the fabric through so it's not loose. Once you're finished just tighten the screw here. Turn it over and we're going to trim off any extra fabric. Flip your hoop over and you're finished! I love coordinating hoops of different colors and sizes. So for these two small ones, I'm going to use two different types of patterns that coordinate with the chenille fabric. We're going to the exact same process for both of these. I really like doing decorations like this because when you go to the big box stores and look for baby decorations often they're overly feminine or overly baby boyish and I don't like my house to feel like it's been overcome by pastel baby colors. This is a great way to add some really sweet but adult decor to a baby room. Now your hoops are finished and these would be perfect for any room in the house. All you have to do is hang them on the wall. You can pick fabric that truly represents your personality.

The northern populations have a rufous rump and back and have a distinct breeding and non-breeding plumage while other populations lack such variation.", "title": "Prinia", "publishedDate": "2013-04-26T13:17:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YKu6ygTG2E", "description": "boss kampf gegen Mantichora in Castlevania aria of sorrow", "title": "Castlevania aria of sorrow  Boss: Mantichora", "publishedDate": "2011-07-18T13:31:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YLUBHLyBQI", "description": "En la capitania de puerto de Telchac, despu\u00e9s de un delicioso pescado frito, nada mejor que probar un fruto extra\u00f1o para mi, \"caimito\"  es dulce, muy rico, pero al final te quedas pegajoso por la resina y por un momento pens\u00e9 que me quedar\u00eda sin poder hablar jajaja   \nMi sobrino: Hashem Alejandro Rodr\u00edguez Lozano -camar\u00f3grafo!", "title": "Caimito", "publishedDate": "2012-06-04T05:28:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YM54yESNZY", "description": "Listen to the speaker read the line slowly.

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "Windy Nights by Robert Louis Stevenson", "publishedDate": "2014-02-15T23:57:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YPhMx39P3g", "description": "Fail: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9QiY72K1ik&#t01m11s\nVector SF: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPiQcBGKjs\nFollow me: http://www.twitter.com/drift0r\nThe Hardline Perk in Black Ops 2 isn't quite as simple as I thought it would be.

There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "Eczema Symptoms and Toddler Eczema Treatment Options", "publishedDate": "2014-01-27T12:49:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YSj2mpwlDU", "description": "Live", "title": "Capercaillie-Silver Spear Reels", "publishedDate": "2009-01-25T10:34:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YSkVQuGI48", "description": "Visita nuestra website oficial\n\nhttp://caribenosdeguadalupe.com/", "title": "Caribe\u00f1os de Guadalupe - No Te Voy A Preguntar - Video Clip 2012 HD", "publishedDate": "2012-09-23T23:34:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YSqPF8yvt8", "description": "kim vodicka reads from \"aesthesia balderdash\" @ river writers (4.24.12), baton rouge, la--\n225riverwriters.blogspot.com", "title": "kim vodicka reads from \"aesthesia balderdash\" @ river writers (4.24.12)", "publishedDate": "2012-05-04T21:26:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YTN3RAwHiw", "description": "ARC-5 Radio Transmitter Oscillator.

Almost a century later, George Russell, a 53-year-old horticulturalist from UK York started to breed the famous Russell hybrids - Lupinus X russellii hort. - Lupinus polphyllus - originally were of basic colours and had large gaps in the flowering spike. Without the use of modern day plant breeding techniques, Russell took to ruthlessly pulling out any plants which he deemed to be unacceptable in growth or display. He spent two decades single-mindedly trying to breed the perfect lupin, crossing - L. polyphyllus - with - L. arboreus - and one or more annual species - L. nootkatensis -. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupinus_... \n\nRussellLupinus grow wild and adorn the countryside of New Zealand's South Island in summer. These spectacular blossoms in the wilderness colour the landscape in every imaginable colour.

And that's only just the tip of the iceberg 'cause there's so much other stuff going on that we are yet to understand, but the genome will tell us whether all the different variations that are important and that have evolved over time, that even if they haven't actually morphed through chance even that affect different physical characteristics are risks for diabetes and hypertension and macular degeneration and that they'll basically point us to all of the different important pathways involved in disease and survival.\nAnd from there actually the question just begins because then we'll have to understand well, what to make of all those changes and what can we do biologically to help that. So if it's something that- we find something important in diabetes how do we develop therapeutics for it?  If it's something that it important for malaria, how do we- that protects from malaria, how do we mimic that therapeutic?  So it's really just a point of launching, a launching point to then- for a lot more exploration, but- and there are definitely-- So it's an exciting time to understand how- and how we're all related, how those- how the- how- what are all the variations that we have, how are those variations important functionally?\nAnd I think that the most important thing is through that process that we have really clear ethical and cultural standards, that we do it in an appropriate way. So I remember in that book as I- in the movie Contact Jodie Foster's asked, \"What was the one question that you would ask?\"  I thought it was really-- A lot of times movies have really poignant moments but they said, \"If you got to meet the higher life, what would you ask?\" and the question was \"How did you do it? How did you go through this transition to technology and not destroy yourself?\"  And I think that that's an important question to ask all the time is how do we go through these points where we have all of this information and we don't somehow use it in a way that's dangerous?\n\u00a0\nQuestion: How do you maintain ethics in your research?\n\u00a0\nPardis Sabeti: So what is good is that the scientific community is- a few things that have happened recently have pointed us to the dangers of this kind of information and so there are a lot of people that are circling around the ethical issues of understanding ourselves and the differences between human populations and information about our own genes that could be important. So yeah, I think that there are a lot of people taking it very seriously and so- and more and more ethics training is coming in to graduate work so that-- both in the ethics of how we conduct research and then the ethics of the information that we get.\nSo I think there's a lot of people focused on it. My-- The institute I'm at, the Broad Institute, I've always really respected the way that they do it. They are very in to the public- making all of their data publicly available, engaging the community. We put a lot of our efforts towards communications so that people understand. We never-- We try not to obviously overstate what we do. We try to engage the community and be careful about a lot of cultural sensitivity so I appreciate that I would say Eric Lander and David Altshuler, who are leading in these efforts of studying genomics and human variation, take it very, very seriously and are very cautious about it and- but it's not just there. That's just where I work but a lot of people in the community that find it important.\n\u00a0\nRecorded on: June 29, 2008", "title": "Dr. Pardis Sabeti: Revealing the Future of Genomics", "publishedDate": "2012-04-23T21:15:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Yry8Dp4v_I", "description": "Just descovered that the stone planet right next to my home planet actually has a diamond center :D the map generator is called Planetoid (http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=89218) and the server i am on is www.zapstrike.com", "title": "Minecraft: Planetoid diamond mine", "publishedDate": "2011-02-11T22:08:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YsOSqFO_-4", "description": "Faux - Backbone \nWritten by Faux.\nProduced, mixed and Mastered by Neil Kennedy at The Ranch production house.\nMusic video by Ben Pollard for Livid Productions.", "title": "Faux - Backbone", "publishedDate": "2014-07-30T10:15:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YsT-8fMWpo", "description": "Tipplers", "title": "RALPHIE'S TIPPLER CAPS CAPS BRONX NY. \"VINNIE'S REAL BLACK", "publishedDate": "2013-10-10T22:12:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YsWtYEYlzE", "description": "Lemon Poppy Seed Cake from tree adorned bundt cake mold.", "title": "Bundt Cake", "publishedDate": "2013-01-05T03:20:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YstM5iLt1o", "description": "I wanted to share the article by John A.

His reasoning about the excessively high cost of British imperialism is worth repeating, both to show Smith at his numerate best and to show that simple, clear economics can lead to radical conclusions:\n\n(bellow quote from Adam Smith:)\n\n\"A great empire has been established for the sole purpose of raising up a nation of customers who should be obliged to buy from the shops of our different producers all the goods with which these could SUPPLY them. For the sake of that little enhancement of price which this MONOPOLY might afford our producers, the home-consumers have been burdened with the whole expense of maintaining and defending that empire. For this purpose, and for this purpose only, in the two last wars, more than a hundred and seventy millions [in pounds] has been contracted over and above all that had been expended for the same purpose in former wars. The interest of this debt alone is not only greater than the whole extraordinary profit, which, it ever could be pretended, was made by the monopoly of the colony trade, but than the whole value of that trade, or than the whole value of the goods, which at an average have been annually exported to the colonies.\"\n\nBellow is the article I was talking about took some out so it could fit in the descriptions box\n\nJohn A. Hobson (1858\u00ac 1940), \"an English economist, wrote one the most famous critiques of the economic bases of imperialism in 1902.\"\n\nhttp://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1902hobson.html\n\n\"No mere array of facts and figures adduced to illustrate the economic nature of the new Imperialism will suffice to dispel the popular delusion that the use of national force to secure new markets by annexing fresh tracts of territory is a sound and a necessary policy for an advanced industrial country like Great Britain.... \n\n But these arguments are not conclusive. It is open to Imperialists to argue thus: \"We must have markets for our growing manufactures, we must have new outlets for the investment of our surplus capital and for the energies of the adventurous surplus of our population: such expansion is a necessity of life to a nation with our great and growing powers of production..\n\nIt was this sudden demand for foreign markets for manufactures and for investments which was avowedly responsible for the adoption of Imperialism as a political policy.... They needed Imperialism because they desired to use the public resources of their country to find profitable employment for their capital which otherwise would be superfluous.... \n\nEvery improvement of methods of production, every concentration of ownership and control, seems to accentuate the tendency. As one nation after another enters the machine economy and adopts advanced industrial methods, it becomes more difficult for its manufacturers, merchants, and financiers to dispose profitably of their economic resources, and they are tempted more and more to use their Governments in order to secure for their particular use some distant undeveloped country by annexation and protection. \n\nThe process, we may be told, is inevitable, and so it seems upon a superficial inspection. Everywhere appear excessive powers of production, excessive capital in search of investment. It is admitted by all business men that the growth of the powers of production in their country exceeds the growth in consumption, that more goods can be produced than can be sold at a profit, and that more capital exists than can find remunerative investment. \n\nIt is this economic condition of affairs that forms the taproot of Imperialism. If the consuming public in this country raised its standard of consumption to keep pace with every rise of productive powers, there could be no excess of goods or capital clamorous to use Imperialism in order to find markets: foreign trade would indeed exist\"...\n(end of space for descriptions box)", "title": "Slave trade, imperialism and capitalism", "publishedDate": "2009-11-15T06:04:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "8YsvmW5mbgY", "description": "http://www.bestfinalexpenseinsurance.com Many people want to have final expense life insurance or as some call it burial life insurance to cover expenses for their loved ones.

It wasn't that much of a surprise to me, but all my friend was doing was delaying the inevitable, but the expression on his face read that it was something more serious than that. \n\nIt seemed as if Alec had something to say, but was scared of how I would react to it, but just as he wouldn't judge me for anything that I say to him, he was my friend and wouldn't judged by me either.  \n\n-Alec, you cool? \nAlec: *sighs* There's something I gotta tell you. \n-What is it? \nAlec: I was talking to your sister, Kimberly earlier and she asked me to go out with her. \n-*narrows eyes* My sister man? What did you tell her? \nAlec: I said yes. \n\nIt's not that I actually minded Alec and Kimberly dating, hell I would probably rather have Kim with him over the other guys that chase her in school all the time, but something just didn't seem right about all of this. In my gut, I had known that Alec had a thing for Kimberly, but with Kimberly, I never saw the same interest reciprocated. \n\nQuickly I got up and headed out of Alec's room and downstairs without saying anything to Alec, just when I was about to exit out the front door, Alec's brother Paul stood in the way. Paul was an asshole, there was no question about it, I wasn't up to dealing with him at the moment, but it seemed like that choice was out of my hands. \n\nPaul: What's up moron? \n-*glares* Shut up idiot \nPaul: Make me. \n-I will.\n\nEveryone who knew me knew that I kept my word, Paul was going to regret messing with me, and the question wasn't even how he was gonna regret it, it was when, and when was sooner than Paul thought it would be. \n\nI passed Paul and headed next door to my house in order to find Kimberly, I'm not sure what Alec thought, but when leaving his house, I wasn't angry with him, but there were answers that he couldn't give. I headed upstairs to Kimberly's room and barged in without knocking, Kimberly and Emma were painting their nails, and my twin looked pissed, but it didn't matter to me. \n\nKimberly: *glares* What the fuck Mango? Do you know the meaning of the word knock? \n-*looks at Emma* I need a minute with Kimberly. \nKimberly: Excuse me? You don't get to barge in here and tell my friends to leave, you can speak to me in front of Emma. \n-Kimberly. \nKimberly: I'll be back in a minute Emma. \nEmma: Okay. \n\nKimberly scoffed before she and I headed into the upstairs hallway, leaving Emma back inside Kim's room, I knew she wanted an explanation but little did Kimberly know, she owed me the same thing. \n\nKimberly: What is this about? \n-I heard you asked out Alec. \nKimberly: *crossed arms* So what Mango? That's none of your business. \n-Kim, you never seemed to take an interest in Alec before. \nKimberly: You don't know what you're talking about, I could've liked him all along. \n\nKimberly then headed back into her room and closed the door, I could tell by the tone of her voice that she was lying, since she didn't give me the answers I was looking for, I decided to get them myself by snooping, my ear went against the door and listened to her and Emma's conversation. \n\nEmma: Does your brother know? \nKimberly: He's suspicious. \nEmma: Imagine what he would do if he found out that I paid you to ask Alec out as a joke. \n\nDamn, I knew something funny was going on, but this was a shocker, how could Kimberly do something like that? I wasn't sure what my next move was gonna be, tell Alec or keep quiet out of loyalty to my sister?

Since 2007, his translated saint's day, 16 June, has been celebrated as Sussex Day.\n\nIt was generally believed that miracles were wrought at Richard's tomb in Chichester cathedral, which was long a popular place of pilgrimage, and in 1262 he was canonized at Viterbo by Pope Urban IV. His feast day is on 3 April in the West, but because this date generally falls within Lent or Eastertide this is normally translated to 16 June in some provinces of the Anglican Communion which venerates St. Richard more widely than does the Roman Catholic Church. Richard furnished the chronicler, Matthew Paris, with material for the life of St. Edmund Rich, and instituted the offerings for the cathedral at Chichester which were known later as \"St. Richard's pence.\" During the episcopate of the first Anglican bishop of Chichester, Richard Sampson, King Henry VIII of England, through his Vicar-General, Thomas Cromwell ordered the destruction of the Shrine of St. Richard in Chichester cathedral in 1538. See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_...\n\nThe history of Chichester Cathedral begins in 681 when Saint Wilfrid brought Christianity to Sussex and established a Cathedral in Selsey, a small community south of Chichester. After 1066 the Norman policy was that cathedrals should be moved from small communities to larger centres of population. In 1075 the Council of London established the See of Chichester and in 1076 the building of the present cathedral in Chichester was begun under Bishop Stigand. It was completed under Bishop Luffa in time for its dedication to the Holy Trinity in 1108.\n\nRichard was born, 1197, in the little town of Wyche, eight miles from Worcester, England. He and his elder brother were left orphans when young, and Richard gave up the studies which he loved, to farm his brother's impoverished estate. His brother, in gratitude for Richard's successful care, proposed to make over to him all his lands; but he refused both the estate and the offer of a brilliant marriage, to study for the priesthood at Oxford. In 1235 he was appointed, for his learning and piety, chancellor of that University, and afterwards, by St. Edmund of Canterbury, chancellor of his diocese. He stood by that Saint in his long contest with the king, and accompanied him into exile. After St. Edmund's death Richard returned to England to toil as a simple curate, but was soon elected Bishop of Chichester in preference to the worthless nominee of Henry III. The king in revenge refused to recognize the election, and seized the revenues of the see. Thus Richard found himself fighting the same battle in which St. Edmund had died. He went to Lyons, was there consecrated by Innocent IV. in 1245, and returning to England, in spite of his poverty and the king's hostility, exercised fully his episcopal rights, and thoroughly reformed his see. After two years his revenues were restored. Young and old loved St. Richard. He gave all he had, and worked miracles, to feed the poor and heal the sick; but when the rights or purity of the Church were concerned he was inexorable. A priest of noble blood polluted his office by sin; Richard deprived him of his benefice, and refused the king's petition in his favor. On the other hand, when a knight violently put a priest in prison, Richard compelled the knight to walk round the priest's church with the same log of wood on his neck to which he had chained the priest; and when the burgesses of Lewes tore a criminal from the church and hanged him, Richard made them dig up the body from its unconsecrated grave, and bear it back to the sanctuary they had violated. Richard died in 1253, while preaching, at the Pope's command, a crusade against the Saracens.\n\nWhite \"Prayer of St. Richard of Chichester\".

The basic purpose of any loom is to hold the warp threads under tension to facilitate the interweaving of the weft threads. The precise shape of the loom and its mechanics may vary, but the basic function is the same. A hand-loom on the other hand is a simple machine used for weaving.In a wooden vertical-shaft looms, the heddles are fixed in place in the shaft. The warp threads pass alternately through a heddle, and through a space between the heddles (the shed), so that raising the shaft raises half the threads (those passing through the heddles), and lowering the shaft lowers the same threads\u2014the threads passing through the spaces between the heddles remain in place.\n\nUttar Pradesh, abbreviated U.P., is a state located in northern India. It was created on 1 April 1937 as the United Provinces with the passing of the States Reorganisation Act and renamed Uttar Pradesh in 1950. Lucknow is the capital of Uttar Pradesh and Kanpur is the economic and industrial capital of Uttar Pradesh while the state high court is in Allahabad. On 9 November 2000, a new state, Uttarakhand, was carved from the mountainous Himalayan region of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe state is bordered by Rajasthan to the west, Haryana and Delhi to the northwest, Uttarakhand and the country of Nepal to the north, Bihar to the east, Jharkhand to the southeast, and Madhya Pradesh to the southwest. It covers 93,933 square miles (243,290 km2), equal to 6.88% of the total area of India, and is the fifth largest Indian state by area. With over 200 million inhabitants as of 2011, it is the most populous state in the country as well as the most populous country subdivision in the whole world. Hindi is the official and most widely spoken language in its 75 districts. Uttar Pradesh is the second largest Indian state by economy. \n\nUttar Pradesh was home to powerful empires of ancient and medieval India, including the Magadha, Nanda, Mauryan, Sunga, Kushan, Gupta, Gurjara, Rashtrakuta, Pala and Mughal empires. The two major rivers of the state, the Ganga and Yamuna, join at Prayag and then flow as the Ganga further east. The state has several historical, natural, and religious tourist destinations, such as the Taj Mahal, Varanasi, Piprahwa, Kaushambi, Ballia, Shravasti, Kushinagar, Lucknow, Chitrakoot, Jhansi, Allahabad, Meerut and Mathura.\n\nAgriculture is the leading occupation in Uttar Pradesh. Wheat is the state's principal food crop and sugarcane is the main commercial crop. About 70% of India's sugar comes from Uttar Pradesh. State industries are localised in the Kanpur region, the fertile purvanchal lands and the Noida region. \n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Getting your dog to hit the target on traditional pee pads is almost impossible and most dogs hate to take a potty break outdoors when the weather's not quite right, but with BullsEye Pee Pads, your dog will hit the bulls eye every time! Bullseye Pee Pads are fitted with concentrated pheromones right in the center of the pad, meaning your pup does his business right where he's supposed to each and every time! Training a puppy to pee on a regular pee pad is great but the problem is, they'll just go anywhere on the pad and that usually means a mess for you.

Su clima, la altitud y suelo f\u00e9rtil contribuyen a la producci\u00f3n de este gran caf\u00e9.\nLa historia de Finca Filadelfia se remonta hasta el a\u00f1o 1866 cuando Manuel Matheu Sinibaldi (1828-1922) compro en el valle de Antigua Guatemala la Finca La Felicidad.\nEn aquel tiempo la cosecha en aquella finca era 38 manzanas (27.14 hect\u00e1reas o 67.86 acres) de Nopal (Opuntia Jaliscana) que hospedaba a la cochinilla (Dactylopius coccus) que fue cosechada y secada para producir tintes naturales rojos.\nEn 1869, los tintes qu\u00edmicos alemanes disponibles bajaron de precio, todos los productores de cochinilla perdieron el dinero y tuvieron que abandonar las plantaciones de nopal. Ese mismo a\u00f1o se comenz\u00f3 a plantar 25,000 plantaciones de caf\u00e9 en Finca La Felicidad y 10,000 en Finca Filadelfia. De aqu\u00ed en adelante se sigui\u00f3 plantando el caf\u00e9 en varias propiedades que se ten\u00edan o se administraban. En 1874 el presidente de Guatemala, el General Justo Rufino Barrios y el Ministerio de agricultura, Manuel Mar\u00eda Herrera y el Gobernador General de Antigua Jos\u00e9 Martin Barrundia nos comisionar\u00f3n a plantar un mill\u00f3n de plantas de caf\u00e9 para regalar a los peque\u00f1os agricultores del \u00e1rea, este hecho ha sido considerado por muchos como el inicio de la industria cafetalera de Guatemala y a  Manuel Mateo Sinibaldi se le considera, el pionero de producci\u00f3n de caf\u00e9 en Antigua y Guatemala.\nLa finca actualmente esta plantada con el caf\u00e9 donde es ideal y esta equilibrado con \u00e1rboles forestales, aguacatales y olivos (un experimento). Adem\u00e1s la parte m\u00e1s alta de la finca ha sido declarada una reserva natural. A la vez comenzamos a proteger los escasos nacimientos de agua. Se instal\u00f3 un sistema de irrigaci\u00f3n por goteo para la plantaci\u00f3n de caf\u00e9 en la parte del valle. Se han hecho mejoras en las instalaciones de alojamiento y se han construido nuevas casas para nuestros trabajadores.\nPara minimizar el impacto ecol\u00f3gico del procesamiento del caf\u00e9 hemos mejorado y modernizado las m\u00e1quinas en el beneficio h\u00famedo y el beneficio seco. Continuamente buscamos mejoras en la tecnolog\u00eda para actualizarnos.\nAdem\u00e1s se instalo una planta de tostado y envasado para vender caf\u00e9 a nivel local y a los turistas que nos visitan. Se cuenta con un \u00e1rea de cataci\u00f2n y se ha contratado un catador profesional que supervisa continuamente la calidad de las cosechas que entran a las bodegas de Filadelfia y de las otras fincas Nimaya y El Recreo, esta supervisi\u00f3n se hace previa a la exportaci\u00f3n y tostado. \u00c9l explica la base del proceso de cataci\u00f2n a los visitantes que toman el tour de caf\u00e9.", "title": "Antigua Guatemala Finca Filadelfia", "publishedDate": "2012-01-18T17:54:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ZOZxaJwTG8", "description": "Makaira Resort, also known as Makaira by the Sea, is a small, 2 bure resort located just minutes from Taveuni's Airport (Matei).

It married striking looks to a calibre protect and an even meliorate camera. Notwithstanding, piece it was undeniably angelic there was allay whatsoever area for transmutation, as state a flagship phone umpteen hoped for modify eyeglasses, little unit and a writer payment body.\nNow the Suomi phone-smiths are bet with the Nokia Lumia Commercial. It's exclusive seen a smaller find help in its plant, and if you assumed that meant that not more had transformed, comfortably, you'd be reactionist.\nPiece Nokia has equipt the Lumia 925 with a similarly ringing camera and destroyed some way to addressing the frame of its flagship, it hasn't rattling developed the glasses, leaving the Nokia Lumia 925 Commercial in the singular billet of notion much suchlike a tweaked telephone than an all new one.\nThis utilized to be a problem when the phone was so pricey, but it's some writer tenable at \u00a3380 (around AU$674) now, making it a overmuch author attractive buy compared to the now interrupted Nokia Lumia 920, tho' the older simulate can now be had for under \u00a3290 through whatsoever sellers.\nWith a 1.5GHz dual-core processor and retributive 1GB of RAM the Nokia Lumia 925 matches the Lumia 920 for h.p. and trails few way behindhand the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S4 or Sony Xperia Z - both of which acquire multiply the RAM and quad-core processors.\nArguably Nokia didn't demand to go all out, since it doesn't eff a vast assets of competition in the Windows Phone place - exclusive the HTC Windows Phone 8X truly poses overmuch of a threat.

It has the identical sharply rectangular spatiality that the Nokia Lumia 920 has, but where that was all bright black impressible, the Nokia Lumia 925 Commercial  has a shiny aluminium ring flying around the sides. It gives it a payment supply that is sorely absent from different Nokia handsets, and it looks favourable for it.\nUnfortunately Nokia hasn't absent the complete hog and prefab a completely metal phone similar the HTC One, and instead made the side from polycarbonate.

The metric was one of our key qualms with the Nokia Lumia 920, so it's unspoilt to see that it's been addressed.\nAt a smooth 8.5mm (0.33 inches), the Nokia Lumia Commercial is quite a bit thinner than its 10.7mm (0.42-inch) predecessor too, piece the length and breadth rest nigh same at 129 x 70.6mm (5.08 x 2.78 inches).\nIt feels pleasant in the collaborator and it's generally quite prosperous to touch, though there are a distich of caveats to that. Firstly the role of the camera lens on the substantiate makes it real effortless to unexpectedly put your fingers over it, which is disquieting and could provide businessman on the lens.\nAnd secondly, the corners aren't rattling incurved, which effectuation they can dig into your jack if you confinement the phone in a foreordained way. On the advantageous back, the polycarbonate backwards feels muffled and warmed against your palm, which is a comforting module.\nThe figurehead of the Nokia Lumia 925 is dominated by the 4.5 progress 768 x 1280 AMOLED strain. It's not quite border to supply but it's not far off at the sides - although there's reams of impressionable above and beneath, which seems a deal unnecessary.

An instrument (bronchoscope) is inserted into the airways, usually through the nose or mouth, or occasionally through a tracheostomy. This allows the practitioner to examine the patient's airways for abnormalities such as foreign bodies, bleeding, tumors, or inflammation. Specimens may be taken from inside the lungs: biopsies, fluid (bronchoalveolar lavage), or endobronchial brushing. The construction of bronchoscopes ranges from rigid metal tubes with attached lighting devices to flexible fibreoptic instruments with realtime video equipment.\nDepartment of Pulmonary medicine,vss medical college,burla.\nIn medicine, pulmonology (aka pneumology) is the specialty that deals with diseases of the lungs and the respiratory tract. It is called chest medicine and respiratory medicine in some countries and areas. Pulmonology is generally considered a branch of internal medicine, although it is closely related to intensive care medicine when dealing with patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Chest medicine is not a specialty in itself but is an inclusive term which pertains to the treatment of diseases of the chest and contains the fields of pulmonology, thoracic surgery, and intensive care medicine. Pulmonology is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases, as well as secondary prevention (tuberculosis). Physicians specializing in this area are called pulmonologists. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa and Australia the term \"respiratory physician\" is used rather than pulmonologist. In Canada, respirology and respirologist are used. Surgery of the respiratory tract is generally performed by specialists in cardiothoracic surgery (or thoracic surgery), though minor procedures may be performed by pulmonologists. Pulmonology is closely related to critical care medicine when dealing with patients that require mechanical ventilation. As a result, many pulmonologists are certified to practice critical care medicine in addition to pulmonary medicine.

It was first discovered in 1964 in Raphael Mechoulam's lab in Israel. And it was about the same time the Beetles were first being exposed to cannabis themselves and it was the 60s and so voila. This is the chemical that's causing all the effects of marijuana is what people thought.\n\nBefore that time people had not been able, scientists had not been able to find this one abundant compound. They couldn't isolate it. They couldn't dictate the chemical structure of it. They found other compounds called cannabinoids in cannabis. But THC was the big find and a 32-year-old scientist discovered it and, you know, made his,  launched an illustrious career.\n\nBut it turns out that THC is not the only game in town in marijuana or in cannabis, and is not the only extremely useful compound in cannabis. And for that you have to look at CBD. CBD stands for cannabidiol, CBD.  It's basically a structural isomer of THC. What that means to say is THC and CBD have the same chemical composition but the atoms are just arranged just a little bit differently. In fact, there's a ring that opens and closes. If that ring is closed it's THC, if that ring is open it's CBD. And you can actually in a flask convert between one and the other with just a little bit of acid. And, you know, any organic chemist out there will know what I'm talking about.\n\nSo that CBD compound we've actually known about for longer than THC but it's only in the last few decades that we've begun to appreciate how useful it is both in helping to modulate the effects of THC and as a unique compound itself. It has antiseizure properties. It has pain relieving properties. It has anticancer properties. It blunts the worst effects of THC itself when it's coadministered. So people talk about dissociative effect with THC. People talk about a anxiogenic effect. When you put CBD in there it actually helps to mitigate those effects. And that's been shown in studies where they go out in the field and they test what types of marijuana people have and the ones that have CBD in them people report improved, less of those negative symptoms I've described. And that's also been seen in animal studies and on and on.\n\nSome groups have even called for just adding CBD into cancer chemotherapy regimens and these are cancer research groups. CBD has been also hailed as a treatment to prevent diabetic neuropathy which is the leading cause of blindness in the United States. It protects nerves. And this is all from a little compound, set of compounds that this cannabis plant naturally produces. Some strains have higher amounts of THC and low amounts of CBD. Some strains have low amounts THC and high amounts of CBD and some are in between somewhere. And that's all part of the genetic diversity and chemical diversity of cannabis.", "title": "What Are THC & CBD? | Marijuana", "publishedDate": "2013-02-24T02:18:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Zr4irXJvng", "description": "OPEN\n-------\nFree 2D Intro #69 | Sony Vegas & After Effects Template\nFree Intro Template for Sony Vegas And After Effects.\nThis template is also available in After Effects in the given download link below.\n________________________________________\u00ad_____\n\nDOWNLOAD: http://velosofy.com/posts/intro-template-069\n________________________________________\u00ad_____\n\nCreator: https://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialNeros\n________________________________________\u00ad_____\n\nFont: Champagne & Limousines Thick\nIntro music: Rezonate | Canvas\nEnding music: Warptech - Last Summer [NoCopyrightSounds Release]\nhttps://soundcloud.com/warptech\nhttps://soundcloud.com/nocopyrightsounds/\nWallpaper used: http://hdw.eweb4.com/wallpapers/1448/\n________________________________________\u00ad_____\n\nSubmit your Templates!: http://www.velosofy.com/submit\n________________________________________\u00ad____\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/VelosofyYT\nhttp://www.velosofy.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/velosofy\nhttp://www.velosofy.com/faq\n________________________________________\u00ad_____", "title": "Free 2D Intro #69 | Sony Vegas Template", "publishedDate": "2014-07-06T13:06:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ZrJs_cmGNo", "description": "Comment Dire... \u00c0 ses parents qu'on a rat\u00e9 son bac\nRendez-vous tous les mardis \u00e0 18h pour une nouvelle vid\u00e9o !\nToutes les vid\u00e9os : http://bit.ly/1cZqGWb\nAbonne-toi : http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=CanalPlusBis\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/canalbiscanal \nTwitter : https://twitter.com/Canal_Bis\n\nReal: Olivier Cavellat\nSon: Cl\u00e9ment Trahard\nMaquillage: Alexandra Walter \nMontage: Marc Antoine Jourdan\nCom\u00e9diens: Jordi Le Bolloc'h Martin Darondeau, Audrey Pirault, Marc Riso, Billie Boiseau, Barbara Bolotner\nStagiaire prod : Nicolas Fitton\n\nRemerciements : Arielle Saracco, Bertrand Delaire, David Sochanek, Marie Toublanc, Arnaud Huiban, Laurent Carr\u00e9, Fabienne Fourquet, Marie Mustel, Rafael Ichou", "title": "Comment Dire... \u00c0 ses parents qu'on a rat\u00e9 son bac - CANAL BIS", "publishedDate": "2014-07-01T16:42:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ZrKjmtQqME", "description": "The next rounf of the You Got Talent competition.\n\nCharacter: Effy Stonem\nTheme: Psycical problems, being heartbroken.", "title": "Effy | Psychical Suffering | YGT", "publishedDate": "2011-02-16T23:03:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ZrNLa8KUrQ", "description": "Found on NicoNico\nhttp://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/nm5117763\n\nPatchouli is sleeping, please dont wake her.", "title": "Patchouli is sleeping", "publishedDate": "2009-07-05T07:47:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ZrkEDUaYFo", "description": "The slope of an indifference curve represents the rate at which the consumer is prepared to trade-off one good for another good and is known as the marginal rate of substitution.

The main difference being, we can now alter the pitch and bank of objects, which leads to improved missile deflection. Once we could guide a missile onto a specific point in 3D space. The natural conclusion was to represent the flares as actual objects, relative to the missile and target. So even if a missile manages to lock onto a flare, its still up to the pilot to place as much distance between himself and the incoming missile as possible. Proximity detonation can still damage your vehicle.\n\nFlares as objects also have the advantage of being able to emit an IR signature. So spamming the environment with IR flares during an approach, means you can deny both players and the AI an easy target.\n\nMost of the basic parameters can be easily configured by the mission maker, using stringtables. With the more advanced options done via script commands. We will be adding more features and options in the future, much depends on the sort of feedback we get.

Speed because opportunity comes in the most unlikely places and events and emotional detachment since emotions can affect whether future trading will be a success or a loss of opportunity when a trader loses huge amount of money from the first trading.Many large businesses today make use of algorithmic trading which is an automatic trading tool that is programmed to do trading on behalf of the trader whether it is stocks, bonds, commodities, Forex or options. Algorithmic trading is used by many trading companies and has helped them to earn high profits even during market declines.What makes the trading tool effective is that it is run by expert traders, often pre-programmed with trading instructions thus reducing errors that human traders often commit. The system makes use of advanced math models or instructions to calculate and make trading decisions based on the facts that it receives. This allows traders or account holders to view the best possible price they can get without affecting costs and stock prices.Algorithmic Trading StrategiesAutomatic trading has since been popular especially among large trading companies and different algorithmic trading strategies have been developed. One of the popular ones is the High Frequency Trading or HFT. HFT takes into consideration three things: multiple markets, market conditions and the levels of liquidity. Once these factors are compiled together, the platform uses complex algorithm to analyse the data it receives and execute the orders implemented by the trader. HFT includes market making, statistical arbitrage and event arbitrage.\n\n\n\n\nTrading PracticesBefore entering into an algorithmic trading practice, traders must first understand the type of fund they are investing. Some funds concentrate on money market or currency pairs, stocks, precious metals such as gold, silver and other industrial metals. Each fund has its own benefits as well as risk which should be taken into consideration. If your risk appetite is high, funds that are deemed high risk but high return is the best; however, for those with low risk appetite, funds that have low inflation rate such as investing in precious metal is ideal.Many of the algorithmic trading platforms include money management controls, current news and reports and calendar and volatility filters that can help traders analyse current market conditions. Some platforms also provide traders with offsetting futures in certain instances when they want to prevent losses due to the volatility of the market.", "title": "Basics Of Algorithmic Trading That Every Trader Should Know", "publishedDate": "2014-10-17T17:06:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_RIqaL2AFI", "description": "Latitude 10 - Piririm Pom Pom", "title": "Latitude 10 - Piririm Pom Pom", "publishedDate": "2011-07-11T19:10:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_RJ0uxa0hI", "description": "Turnamen Piala Silva's Bandung Tectona 2013 Ananta Volley Ball Club VS JVC\nBandung, 2 - 5 Januari 2014\nGor Persada/Tectona Bandung", "title": "Piala Silva's Bandung Tectona 2013 Ananta Volley Ball Club VS JVC Part 3", "publishedDate": "2014-01-22T09:06:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_RXmp_Uv2s", "description": "", "title": "1 try BoomZ Fortification 11,12 [\u2022P\u0e4b\u0e4fnD\u266a\u00ab\u2716] his Extreme Boomerang", "publishedDate": "2011-11-09T14:53:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_R_kshI4us", "description": "H&R pardner pump", "title": "New gun alert!!

The percussion family is believed to include the oldest musical instruments, following the human voice.[1]\n\nThe percussion section of an orchestra most commonly contains instruments such as timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle and tambourine. However, the section can also contain non-percussive instruments, such as whistles and sirens, or a blown conch shell. On the other hand, keyboard instruments, such as the celesta, are not normally part of the percussion section, but keyboard percussion instruments such as the glockenspiel and xylophone (which do not have piano keyboards) are included.\n\nPercussion instruments are most commonly divided into two classes: Pitched percussion instruments, which produce notes with an identifiable pitch, and unpitched percussion instruments, which produce notes without an identifiable pitch.[2][3]\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Classification\n2 History\n3 Function\n4 Percussion notation\n5 Classifications\n5.1 By methods of sound production\n5.1.1 Idiophone\n5.1.2 Membranophone\n5.1.3 Chordophone\n5.1.4 Aerophone\n5.2 By musical function or orchestration\n5.2.1 Definite pitch\n5.2.2 Indefinite pitch\n5.3 By prevalence in common knowledge\n5.3.1 Conventional or popular\n5.3.2 Unconventional\n5.4 By cultural significance or tradition\n5.4.1 Folk percussion instruments\n5.4.2 \"Common\" drums\n5.5 By capability of melodic production\n5.6 By percussive beater\n6 Names for percussionists\n7 Manufacturers\n8 See also\n9 Notes and references\n10 Further reading\n11 External links\nClassification[edit]\nMain article: Classification of percussion instruments\nHornbostel\u2013Sachs has no high-level section for percussion. Most percussion instruments (as the term is normally understood) are classified as idiophones and membranophones. However the term percussion is instead used at lower-levels of the Hornbostel\u2013Sachs hierarchy, including to identify instruments struck with either a non-sonorous object (hand, stick, striker) or against a non-sonorous object (human body, the ground) \u2013 as opposed to concussion which refers to instruments in which two or more complementary sonorous parts are struck against each other \u2013 and for other purposes, for example:\n\n111.1 Concussion idiophones or clappers, played in pairs and beaten against each other, such as zills and clapsticks.\n\n111.2 Percussion idiophones, includes many percussion instruments played with the hand or by a percussion mallet, such as the hang, gongs and the xylophone, but not drums and only some cymbals.\n\n21 Struck drums, includes most types of drum, such as the timpani, snare drum, and tom-tom. (Included in most drum sets or\n\n412.12 Percussion reeds, a class of wind instrument unrelated to percussion in the more common sense\n\nThere are many instruments that have some claim to being percussion, but are classified otherwise:\n\nKeyboard instruments such as the celesta and piano.[4]\nStringed instruments played with beaters such as the hammered dulcimer.\nUnpitched whistles and similar instruments, such as the pea whistle and Acme siren.\nThe word \"percussion\" has evolved from Latin terms: \"percussio\" (which translates as \"to beat, strike\" in the musical sense, rather than the violent action), and \"percussus\" (which is a noun meaning \"a beating\"). As a noun in contemporary English it is described in Wiktionary as \"the collision of two bodies to produce a sound\". The usage of the term is not unique to music but has application in medicine and weaponry, as in percussion cap, but all known and common uses of the word, \"percussion\", appear to share a similar lineage beginning with the original Latin: \"percussus\". In a musical context then, the term \"percussion instruments\" may have been coined originally to describe a family of musical instruments including drums, rattles, metal plates, or blocks which musicians would beat or strike (as in a collision) to produce sound.", "title": "Percusi\u00f3n efecto de sonido 15 - Percussion sound effect 15", "publishedDate": "2014-11-10T08:18:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_Y8KwgGRoI", "description": "funny clip about a guy called booby flecture who rings up for a job interview with beer cans strapped to his head and he keps burping but gets away with it", "title": "bobby flecture calls about a job", "publishedDate": "2012-08-17T02:15:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_YLKySjEN4", "description": "Insane Remix!\n\nFollow Jay Cosmic on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/jaycosmic\nYouTube:http://www.youtube.com/user/JayCosmicOfficial\nand SoundCloud:https://soundcloud.com/jay-cosmic\n\nFREE DOWNLOAD:https://www.facebook.com/jaycosmic/app_190322544333196", "title": "DVBBS & Borgeous - Tsunami (Jay Cosmic Remix) [720p]", "publishedDate": "2014-01-07T00:26:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_YsRPcyDMY", "description": "", "title": "Calcium and IP3 in Signaling Pathways", "publishedDate": "2012-05-10T02:27:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_Z1AUF-1Ng", "description": "Add me on Instagram: itsjudyha\n\nMy recent visit to the LA County Museum of Art has inspired me to recreate artwork by the famous Piet Mondrian called \"Composition of Red, Blue, and Yellow.\" If you are having trouble thinking of different lines to draw, you may search his name in google images.\n\nProducts used:\n- Nail Envy base coat by OPI\n- Blanc by Essie\n- Pure Black by Cre8tion\n- Mesmerize by Essie\n- Apertif by Essie\n- Yellow by Kleancolor\n- Seche Vite top coat\n\nMusic: \"Finding the Balance\" by Kevin MacLeod at http://incompetech.com/", "title": "Mondrian Nails", "publishedDate": "2012-06-25T08:31:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_ZHD0n-2bE", "description": "2012 / Tommy Mas Production", "title": "Action Bronson - Shiraz", "publishedDate": "2013-06-30T18:16:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "8__7KggvETU", "description": "A video I made with the pictures i got from Flutterstalker.\nMy tumblr: http://ask-gamer-pony.tumblr.com/\nFlutterstalker: http://askflutterstalker.tumblr.com/", "title": "Flutterstalker- Volatile times", "publishedDate": "2012-05-01T07:17:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "8__E0DyyqBg", "description": "http://www.vagabondageband.com\nhttp://vagabondage1.bandcamp.com/\nhttp://www.llanoblue.com/\n\nTwo Stars, the new video for the hit single from Bay Area drunk-folk band Vagabondage from their second studio album Whiskey & Starlight.

Taking its title from the mysterious room in The Shining's haunted Overlook Hotel that might hold the key to the building's deadly secret, Rodney Ascher's Room 237 is not a behind-the-scenes making-of or a tribute to Kubrick's horror masterpiece; rather, it's a brilliant, hilarious, and sometimes eerie cinematic soapbox for five obsessive cineastes whose theories about the cryptic themes and hidden messages in The Shining are Byzantine, outrageous, and maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 true. One theorizer believes that The Shining is an allegory for the genocide of Native Americans, another an allegory for the Holocaust; one focuses on the \"impossible\" architecture of the Overlook, while another weaves in the conspiracy theory that Kubrick artificially staged and filmed the Apollo 11 moon landings to read The Shining as his subliminal apology for his deception. Keeping his five subjects offscreen and using their ruminations as voiceover narration, Ascher allows each to expound their hypotheses while illustrating their examples with key scenes from The Shining \u2014 and while some of these theories may be too wild to ever be believed, by immersing the audience in Kubrick's brilliant visuals Ascher intimates that there may indeed be a method in these various madnesses. Both a kaleidoscopic deconstruction of a horror classic and a portrait of truly fanatical obsession, Room 237 is one of the year's most fascinating documentaries.", "title": "ROOM 237 Trailer | New Release 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-03-28T15:25:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_nZro3T7vU", "description": "For more precisions about this invocation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lKVYxlksCk\n\nIt was narrated from 'Aishah (May God be pleased with her) that she said: \n\"O Messenger of Allah, what do you think I should say in my supplication, if I come upon the Night of Value ?\" \nHe said: \"Say: O Allah, You are Forgiving and love forgiveness, so forgive me.'\"  (Reported by at-Tirmidhi) \n\nPhonetic:\n\nAllahumma innaka 'afuwwun tuhibbul-'afwa, fa'fu 'anni\n\nArabic:\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0651\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0641\u064f\u0648\u0651\u064c \u062a\u064f\u062d\u0650\u0628\u0651\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0648\u064e \u0641\u064e\u0627\u0639\u0652\u0641\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0651\u0650\u064a \n\nAnimation et 3rd video:\n\nOriginal video \"zero-project: Infinity\": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbl_OuXiNHc\nof zero project: http://www.youtube.com/user/zeroprojectgr\nCreative Commons licensed video (BY): \nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode\n\n2nd video:\n\nOriginal video \"Post Rock time lapse\": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxl1ddgDDKg\nof Jason Sissoyev: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheJacen\nCreative Commons licensed video (BY): \nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode", "title": "Supplication for the Night of Value (Laylatul-Qadr)", "publishedDate": "2014-05-09T15:16:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_o0QheZ-Fs", "description": "Resurrection video at '14 Internation Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses", "title": "Resurrection video", "publishedDate": "2014-07-07T14:38:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_o1AKiFmlE", "description": "", "title": "Valedictory Function of ANTI TOBACCO CAMPAIGN by 93.5 RED FM, Mangalore ***    V4 NEWS 24*7", "publishedDate": "2014-06-12T16:39:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_oFA6lGT1I", "description": "Wild Chives and Soybean Soup Episode 18 [Eng Sub]\nClick Here to Subscribe: http://bit.ly/10TNEL1\nClick Here to Watch The Full Episode: http://bit.ly/1hG4Le1\n\nWild Chives and Soybean Soup (\ub2ec\ub798 \ub41c, \uc7a5\uad6d: 12\ub144\ub9cc\uc758 \uc7ac\ud68c) \n\nStarring Lee So Yeon and Nam Goong Min\n\nIn this playful romantic comedy, high school student Jang Gook accidentally falls pregnant after sleeping with her tutor, Yoo Joon Soo, during the frenzy of the 2002 World Cup.

After all, how many famous figures can boast that their name became an adjective (in this case 'Dickensian') meaning squalid, grim and poverty-stricken? That's an impressive accomplishment of excellent descriptive writing (if perhaps somewhat depressing). \n\nDickens was a 19th century English novelist whose work was best known for being, aside from bleak, highly realistic and descriptive with fully developed and highly relatable characters. He occasionally wrote under the pen-name Boz (pronounced \"Boze\" - rhymes with rose), from a family nickname given to his youngest brother - just one of myriad interesting Charles Dickens facts. Throughout his career, Dickens authored over a dozen major novels, which were usually published originally as monthly serials, as well as a large number of short stories and a handful of books of non-fiction. Among his most famous works is A Christmas Carol, the cautionary tale whose film adaptations have become a traditional Christmas staple in many homes each year. \n\nWhile his death occurred nearly 150 years ago, his books remain popular and often read, and some of his characters -- Oliver Twist, Ebenezer Scrooge, David Copperfield and many more -- are among the most iconic and best-known in literary history.\n\nEnjoy our 10 facts about Charles Dickens.

From about day 5 pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH, promotes the growth of a follicle in the ovary.  Follicular cells produce estrogen, which builds up the endometrium, the uterine lining, in readiness for implantation of the fertilized egg.  In midcycle, a surge of pituitary luteinizing hormone, or LH, causes ovulation. The corpus luteum secretes progesterone, which reinforces estrogen and builds up the endometrium to its maximum thickness.  If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum degenerates in the last few days of the cycle and the lining is shed during menstruation, which marks the start of a new cycle.  If fertilization occurs, about day 14 the fertilized egg secretes human chorionic gonadotrophin, or HCG.  This maintains the corpus luteum and its output of progesterone and estrogen so that the endometrium is maintained during pregnancy and menstruation does not occur.  The endometrium then nourishes the fertilized egg.", "title": "How the Body Works : The Menstrual Cycle", "publishedDate": "2007-08-02T14:00:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_roR84_LM8", "description": "My new kitten Ivy P!

If not then you should because it is one the most common becoming disease in the world. And the most disturbing fact is that it is very hard to detect  unless you get a professional medical check up. That is the reason it is one on the problems for which you need to be extra careful. In this video we will tell you a lot of things that you must know about herpes. \n\nHerpes is normally found to be mostly transferred through sexual transmission. In most cases people who have herpes, are not aware themselves and hence they go on to have sex with their partner or partner and in the context infect others. In some cases when they are aware that they have herpes still they are hesitant to let their partner know due to the fear of sexual rejection. This is the also one reason why this disease is becoming so common in united states. Hence, next time you have sex, first find out whether your partner has got herpes or not. Symptoms of herpes are blisters on the genital and pain during urination. Sometimes symptoms don't appear or are very fade. Hence best bet is get a medical checkup. Also, if you are the person having herpes, stay away from sexual intercourse until you get rid of herpes. Remember herpes can be treated. \n\nNow let us talk about herpes treatment. Normally you are given antivirals for herpes treatment. They actually not treat it but just suppress the symptoms from appearing. Hence the virus still remains in the body, it is less active. But as soon as you stop using the antivirals,  the virus becomes active again. Hence guys, this is not the best option. You need to get rid of virus to get rid of the disease and not just get rid of the symptoms. Hence you should go for natural herpes treatment that has been found very helpful. So, I would suggest you should try out the natural herpes cure that we have mentioned above.\nWhat is Herpes \nHow to Treat Herpes \nwhat are herpes\nhow to cure herpes\ntreating herpes\ncuring herpes\ntreatments for herpes\nwhat is hsv\nwhat is herpes simplex\nwhat is hsv 1\nwhat is hsv 2\nhow to treat hsv\nhow to cure hsv\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_s09P5Yfn8", "title": "What is Herpes ?

And a 68-year-old Taiwanese security guard who last year found himself in some apparently serious debt was desperate enough to steal maintenance funds from the building he worked in.\n\nOne of the building\u2019s accountants eventually discovered the missing money and questioned the elderly man. The security guard knew it was only a matter of time before someone realized he\u2019d been slipping money from the maintenance funds into his own pocket so he decided to buy himself some time by getting rid of the accountant.\n\nOne day, while the accountant was working, the security guard picked up a hammer and attacked her. Luckily, his attempt failed when the blow he hit her with failed to down her, and she fled into a nearby stairwell where one of the building\u2019s tenants heard her screams and came to the rescue.\n\nDuring an appearance in court, the security guard dropped to his knees and begged for clemency from the judge because of his advanced age. The victim also forgave him for almost killing her, so the old man escaped with just a 30-month jail sentence.\n\nIt seems kinda like a slap on the wrist for attempted murder.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

So we invited a small film crew, a handful of fans in blacksuits, a guy called Allan with some UV paint, and a bag of confetti into our rehearsal space in N\u00f8rrebro, Copenhagen, for a mini concert.  \n\nThe event was recorded and streamed live on our website April 25th at 8pm, and 'On My Side' was the last of 3 songs that we played. We had one chance to get it right, a lot of things could have gone wrong, but they didn't and that's why you can hear the cheer at the end :) \n\nPre order FAULT LINES here (Scandinavia only): http://itunes.apple.com/preorder/fault-lines/id530580488 \n\nConcept & Direction: Jacob Olsen & Morten K\u00f8ie\nProducer: Thor Jacobsen\nLine Producer: Joakim Harder\nCamera 1: Theis Mortensen\nCamera 2: Anders Aag\u00e5rd\nCamera 3: Christian\nAdditional recordings on phones: Amalie, Amanda, Isabella, Nina Simone, Nikolai, Pernille, Louise, Julie, L\u00e6rke, Fie, Laura and her friend whose name we never got.\nEditor: Anders Jon Petersen\nGrading: S\u00f8ren Lund\nStreaming tech: Peter Mark\nDecorations: Allan Bestle\nGaffer: Jacob Hoffmann\nProps: Rasmus Vith\nRunner: Nanna Frimodt\nProduction Company: Spoiled productions / DDB", "title": "Turboweekend - On My Side (Live stream recap)", "publishedDate": "2012-06-04T10:50:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8_w-hes_Ub0", "description": "Coffee 'tasting notes' can be baffling for those who are not familiar with the concepts or the jargon.
