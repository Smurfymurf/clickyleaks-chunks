It was based on the Pulitzer Prize winning The Grapes of Wrath (1939), written by John Steinbeck. The screenplay was written by Nunnally Johnson and the executive producer was Darryl F. Zanuck.[1]\n\nThe film tells the story of the Joads, an Oklahoma family, who, after losing their farm during the Great Depression in the 1930s, become migrant workers and end up in California. The motion picture details their arduous journey across the United States as they travel to California in search for work and opportunities for the family members.\n\nIn 1989, this film was one of the first 25 films to be selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath - 1940 - Henry Fonda - Trailer", "publishedDate": "2009-08-23T01:23:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ayiBZnaqxA", "description": "DEFF COST YOUTUBE EXCLUSIVE\nBY SERIPH\nwww.soundcloud.com/seriph\n\n\n\n2014\nDEFF COAsT MUSIC\nwww.facebook.com/deffcoast", "title": "SERIPH & SAULE - MONGREL", "publishedDate": "2014-04-29T18:59:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "5aymu3G9BuY", "description": "Universal Studios Orlando closed it's Jaws attraction one year ago, but you can still see Jaws!

And you really wouldn't know the difference by looking at them. Versus some of the other products that are on the market like these undergarment pads or these little pads that look kind of like diapers, not something that people would really want to wear, they make a lot of noise, they are bulky, you don't want people knowing you are wearing them. Some people may be embarrassed to purchase them at the store. \nWhereas with the Conni briefs, like I said before, they look and feel like regular briefs and they are just as, if not more absorbent than other products on the market. What also makes these products so great is that they are reusable and you don't have to just throw them away. It doesn't have such as negative effect on the environment.

Nickel-cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2\u00a0V. The cell consists of a positive nickel hydroxide electrode and a negative cadmium electrode plate separated by an alkaline electrolyte (potassium hydroxide).[30] The European Union banned the use of cadmium in electronics in  with several exceptions but reduced the allowed content of cadmium in electronics to 0.002%.[31]\n\n Australia Banks | Canada Banks | India Banks | Malaysia Banks | Singapore Banks | UK Banks | US Banks More International Banks\n\n The British Geological Survey reports that in , China was the top producer of cadmium, producing almost one-sixth of the world share, closely followed by South Korea and Japan.[24]\n\n Naturally occurring cadmium isposed of 8 isotopes. Two of them are naturally radioactive, and three are expected to decay but have not been experimentally confirmed to do so. The two natural radioactive isotopes are 113Cd (beta decay, half-life is 7.7 \u00d7  years) and 116Cd (two-neutrino double beta decay, half-life is 2.9 \u00d7  years). The other three are 106Cd, 108Cd (both double electron capture), and 114Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on their half-life times have been set. At least three isotopes\u00a0-- 110Cd, 111Cd, and 112Cd\u00a0-- are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are 109Cd with a half-life of 462.6 days, and 115Cd with a half-life of 53.46 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 2.5 hours, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 5 minutes. Cadmium has 8 known meta states, with the most stable being 113mCd (t\u00bd = 14.1 years), 115mCd (t\u00bd = 44.6 days), and 117mCd (t\u00bd = 3.36 hours).[6]\n\n Asset Management Jobs | Corporate Banking Jobs | FX Money Markets Jobs | Hedge Funds Jobs | HR   Recruitment Jobs | Investment Banking Jobs | IT Jobs | Private Banking   Wealth Management Jobs | Private Equity   Venture Capital Jobs | Real Estate Jobs | Sales   Marketing Jobs | Trading Jobs More Job Listings", "title": "cadmium iron ore mining", "publishedDate": "2012-09-11T10:04:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "5bC7KJ37Na4", "description": "Bouldering Gower", "title": "Coal Face V2", "publishedDate": "2011-11-09T22:24:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "5bCGock5rX0", "description": "Sultan Suleiman's poem to death prince Bayez\u0131d\n\nMuhte\u015fem Y\u00fczy\u0131l'\u0131n t\u00fcm b\u00f6l\u00fcmlerini ve daha fazlas\u0131n\u0131 kanal\u0131m\u0131zda bulabilirsiniz.

From its first scene, in which an unmarried couple balances pleasure and guilt in a lunchtime liaison in a cheap hotel (hardly a common moment in a major studio film in 1960), Psycho announced that it was taking the audience to places it had never been before, and on that score what followed would hardly disappoint. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is unhappy in her job at a Phoenix, Arizona real estate office and frustrated in her romance with hardware store manager Sam Loomis (John Gavin). One afternoon, Marion is given $40,000 in cash to be deposited in the bank. Minutes later, impulse has taken over and Marion takes off with the cash, hoping to leave Phoenix for good and start a new life with her purloined nest egg. 36 hours later, paranoia and exhaustion have started to set in, and Marion decides to stop for the night at the Bates Motel, where nervous but personable innkeeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) cheerfully mentions that she's the first guest in weeks, before he regales her with curious stories about his mother. There's hardly a film fan alive who doesn't know what happens next, but while the shower scene is justifiably the film's most famous sequence, there are dozens of memorable bits throughout this film. The first of a handful of sequels followed in 1983, while Gus Van Sant's controversial remake, starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche, appeared in 1998.\n\npsycho,\"psycho clip\",psychosocial,\"psychosocial baby\",\"psychosocial slipknot\",\"psycho killer\",psychostick,\"psycho realm\",\"psycho girlfriend\",\"psychopathic rydas\",\"psycho puddle of mudd\",\"martin balsam\",\"anthony perkins\",\"classic horror movies\",classics,\"slashers and serial killers\",\"alfred hitchcock\",\"house videos\",\"norman bates\",\"milton arbogast\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++39578,/m/034q3l,/m/016dgz", "title": "Psycho (10/12) Movie CLIP - Arbogast Meets Mother (1960) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T13:31:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "5bii9MKDzA8", "description": "Beautiful singing", "title": "Awesome singer", "publishedDate": "2010-11-29T00:34:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "5bis7SHRNGw", "description": "Grevillea - spider flower - silky oak HD 04 - Video by Laborator TEBA\nOferta Speciala - plante si seminte de vanzare      http://www.albizia.ro/\n+40 74 782 1314    /    074 782 1314   \nGrevillea Scientific classification:\nAngiosperms\nEudicots\nProteales\nProteaceae\nGrevilleoideae\n\nGrevillea species:\nGrevillea acacioides\nGrevillea acanthifolia\nGrevillea acerata\nGrevillea acrobotrya\nGrevillea acropogon Makinson\nGrevillea acuaria\nGrevillea adenotricha \nGrevillea agrifolia\nGrevillea albiflora \nGrevillea alpina\nGrevillea alpivaga\nGrevillea althoferorum \nGrevillea amplexans\nGrevillea anethifolia\nGrevillea aneura\nGrevillea angulata\nGrevillea angustiloba\nGrevillea annulifera \nGrevillea aquifolium\nGrevillea arenaria\nGrevillea argyrophylla\nGrevillea armigera\nGrevillea asparagoides\nGrevillea aspera\nGrevillea aspleniifolia\nGrevillea asteriscosa \nGrevillea aurea\nGrevillea australis\nGrevillea baileyana\nGrevillea banksii\nGrevillea banyabba\nGrevillea barklyana \nGrevillea batrachioides \nGrevillea baueri\nGrevillea baxteri\nGrevillea beadleana\nGrevillea beardiana\nGrevillea bedggoodiana\nGrevillea bemboka\nGrevillea benthamiana \nGrevillea berryana\nGrevillea biformis\nGrevillea bipinnatifida\nGrevillea biternata\nGrevillea brachystachya\nGrevillea brachystylis\nGrevillea bracteosa\nGrevillea brevifolia\nGrevillea brevis\nGrevillea bronwenae\nGrevillea buxifolia \nGrevillea byrnesii", "title": "Grevillea - spider flower - silky oak HD 04", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T17:00:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "5bivVJ9Gd74", "description": "troph\u00e9 de chasse du chat . ... samsung smartphone wave 1 gt 8500", "title": "chat chenille", "publishedDate": "2013-12-28T09:32:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "5bjLVKkplVo", "description": "SkilledInc.com tutorial on how to top up your PayPal account (relevant to hirers).", "title": "Topping Up Your Paypal Account - Hirer", "publishedDate": "2013-12-02T06:17:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "5bjVHRqQQkk", "description": "\u25ba\u25bahttp://bit.ly/1dgxfXG\u25c4\u25c4   Click Link To Left To Get Your Discounted Offer Today.\n\nHow can I lose weight fast? There is an answer that will work for you and there is a discounted offer available right this minute!\n\nWith more than sixty percent of Americans now said to be overweight, there are literally millions of people who are struggling with that same question particularly when a new year approaches.\n\nWhilst there are ways to lose weight fast and many diets out there, it is not generally a recommended method. If you want to lose weight faster, then you may have to accept that you could put it back on again equally fast.\n\nThere is no need to use diet pills or other aids, or to go on unhealthy starvation diets or silly regimes that deprive your body of essential nutrients. If you are asking yourself how can I lose weight real fast then you may be tempted into those sorts of quick result promised regimes.\n\nThe fat loss factor is a new program which has helped over 200,000 people over the last twelve months or so. \n\nWhat is the fat loss factor?\n\nWell the fat loss factor is based on sensible dieting which is designed to regulate the metabolism. The author Dr Charles Livingston believes ( and given the number of delighted customers who have given a review of the fat loss factor be must be onto something)that the liver is the main organ regulating weight loss and weight gain and in the westernised world we have livers which are feeling the strain of a very rich diet. He finds that detoxing the liver and using some techniques which have been around for many years helps to lose weight fast but in a controlled way.\n\nThe fatlossfactor is a ebook with supplementary dietary guides and workout routines although this is a diet for the folk who do not want to kill themselves exercising- this is a moderate regime. There is full email support and encouragement and those using the fat loss factor have been reporting some impressive results on what some have described as groundbreaking but sensible suggestions for losing weight fast.\n\nIf you are asking yourself how to shift those pounds and how to lose weight fast then the fat loss factor could be for you.\nHere is that link again if you need it\n\nGo to \u25ba\u25bahttp://bit.ly/1dgxfXG\u25c4\u25c4\n\ndiet, nutrition, abs diet, six pack abs diet, fat loss diet, insane, home, fat, loss, insanehomefatloss, mike chang, Sanela, workout, exercise, fitness, health, fat loss, belly fat, nutrition, Abdominal Obesity (Symptom), Weight Loss (Symptom), losing weight, fat, excersize, losing abdominal fat, slimming, fat loss factor review, fat loss factor, my review, lose weight, weight loss, product review, my testimonial, my fat loss, after fat loss factor, fat loss factor, fat loss factor review, fat loss factor scam, fat loss factor program, fat loss factor reviews, fat loss factor program review, Fat Loss Factor, the fat loss factor program, how to lose weight fast, diet weight loss secrets, best way to lose weight, losing weight fast, fat loss factor, fat loss factor review, fat loss factor scam, fat loss factor book, fat loss factor free, fat loss factor download, fat loss factor, fat loss factor review, Fat Loss Factor Scam, Fat Loss Factor Program Review, Fat Loss Factor Diet, Fat Loss Factor Program, Fat Loss Factor Free Download\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bjVHRqQQkk", "title": "Fat Loss Factor Review - How To Lose Weight Fast", "publishedDate": "2013-02-27T22:38:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "5bjXu8HphPw", "description": "Carlos nos muestra un poco de su entrenamiento cardiovascular diario para mantener un cuerpo delgado y atl\u00e9tico, tambi\u00e9n nos ense\u00f1a el outfit deportivo que utiliz\u00f3 para la grabaci\u00f3n del v\u00eddeo.\n\n- Comenta - Suscribete - Me gusta - Comparte - Gracias -\n\nAgradecimientos a @YanMart\u00edn @MattO'Toole y a todo el equipo @ReebokMx\n\u00a8lamento de todo coraz\u00f3n haber utilizado elementos de @PumaMx -CarlosCarlos.\u00a8\n\nwww.Facebook.com/ConsultorFitness\nInstagram.com/CarlosCarCarli\nCarlosConsultorFitness@hotmail.com\n\nFIND YOUR OWN FITNESS Reebok", "title": "Entrenamiento cardiovascular y Outfit deportivo", "publishedDate": "2013-06-28T16:36:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "5bjkldryEnI", "description": "Dude got tackled and gave up quick! \n\nHe tried to steal 2 bottles of liquor and an unknown item.

What they do not yet know is that they have been dead for several years, and no-one is expecting them back. \n\nThose returning from beyond the grave are determined to reclaim their places in the world of the living. The living are thrown into a state of turmoil by the return of friends and relatives who don't understand that time has moved on. \n\nBut it seems they are not the only ones to have returned from the dead. Their arrival coincides with a series of gruesome murders which bear a chilling resemblance to the work of a serial killer from the past. \n\nFollow us on Twitter: www.twitter.com/madmanfilms\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/madmanfilms", "title": "The Returned (2014) - Official Trailer", "publishedDate": "2014-01-31T03:57:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "5bvfDhzyGhs", "description": "Philadelphia fleabane Gun/Missile.

Chant was performed in the Great Church a capella by male choirs under the direction of the domestikos. By contrast, in the Palace Court secular music was accompanied by instruments. Byzantine music was transmitted orally via a master/apprentice relationship as well as through a neumatic notational system (parasemantiki) that describes the melodic movement through microtonal intervals (Byzantine echos) developed in 12th century. The cantors (psaltes) wore wide-brimmed hats (skiadion) or tall \"bullet\" hats (skaranikon) and dressed in special cloaks (kamision and phelonion) girded with a belt (sfiktourion). \n\nThis cantors' costume tradition was lost after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 leaving the cantor dressed only with a black robe (rason) of the Eastern Church. However, for the first time since the Fall, Yorgos Bilalis has joined forces with costume designer Fatima Lavor-Peters to recreate these Byzantine vestments as they are described in several treatises or depicted on Byzantine frescoes and manuscript miniatures.\n\nROMEIKO ENSEMBLE PERFORMS AT NATIONAL LIBRARY OF   \nGREECE IN ATHENS   \nDec. 13, 2006   \nAt the invitation of the National Library of Greece, Romeiko Ensemble performed a   concert of Christmas hymnology in the Byzantine and post-Byzantine traditions transcribed from respective manuscripts in the Library's collection. The National Library of Greece (NLG) preserves amongits other treasures around 500 musical manuscripts of the Byzantine and post-Byzantine era. These manuscripts contain hymns and nonsensesyllables texts (terirem) from Byzantine (12th-15th c.) and post-Byzantine (16th-18th c.) composers. The Byzantine melodies were written in the old Byzantine script (parasemantiki) that contemporary musicians and cantors are not able to read or perform. Few Byzantine melodies were transcribed into the contemporary musical (psaltic) notation of 1814 (Chrysanthine notation) by Chourmouzios Chartophylax (\u20201840) using as a transcription code the sound of 17th-18th century psaltic tradition. Musicologists of the 20th century tried to restore the Byzantine melodies into the original sound, but their attempts were not accurate.

Paralyzed from the neck down, he was taken to Saint Marys Hospital at Mayo Clinic, where he was placed in an \"iron lung\" to allow him to breathe. He remained there for the next 16 years.\n\nThe poliovirus permanently damaged Dave's body, but his joy for life was untouched.  His positive outlook inspired his fellow patients and won him many friends.  Famous entertainers and athletes, politicians and royalty all dropped by his room to visit.  He ran a TV rental business from his iron lung and appeared on the Today Show.  But his greatest accomplishment was the sense of hope he gave to everyone he met.\n\nA Cheerful Heart tells the story of this immensely likeable, unforgettable man whose strong faith, loving family and good heart helped him face the challenge of his illness with courage and cheer. \n\nThe film will be shown on every Mayo Clinic campus during Heritage Days (September 30 -- October 4, 2013.)  DVD copies of the film will be sold in Mayo-affiliated retail outlets beginning October 7.\n\nMayo Clinic Heritage Films produces original documentaries and dramatizations about key aspects of Mayo's history.

Spectacled bears are the only surviving species of bear native to South America, and the only surviving member of the subfamily Tremarctinae. The Spectacled Bear is the only bear native to South America and is technically the largest land carnivore on that continent, although as little as 5% of its diet is compromised by meat. South America's largest obligate carnivore is the jaguar. Among South America's extant, native land animals, only the Baird's and South American Tapirs are heavier than this species. The Spectacled bear is a mid-sized species of bear. Overall its fur is blackish in color, though bears may vary from jet black to dark brown and to even a reddish hue. The species typically has distinctive beige-coloured marking across its face and upper chest, though not all Spectacled bears have \"spectacle\" markings. The pattern and extent of pale markings are slightly different on each individual bear and bears can be readily distinguished by this. Males are a third larger than females in dimensions and sometimes twice their weight. Males can weigh 100 -- 200 kilograms (220 -- 440 lb), and females 35 --82 kilograms (77 -- 181 lb). Length can range from 120 to 200 cm (47--79 in), with a tail length of a mere 7 cm (2.8 in), and shoulder height from 60 to 90 cm (24--30 in). Compared to other living bears, this species has a more rounded face with a relatively short and broad snout. In some extinct species of the Tremarctinae subfamily, this facial structure has been thought to be an adaptation to a largely carnivorous diet, despite the modern Spectacled bears' herbivorous dietary preferences. They are found in several areas of northern and western South America, including eastern Panama, western Venezuela, spectacled bear has a reputation for being adaptable, as it is found in a wide variety of habitats and altitudes throughout its range, including cloud forests, high altitude grasslands, dry forest and scrub desert. Occasionally they may reach altitudes as low as 250 m (820 ft) but are not typically found below 1,900 m (6,200 ft) in the foothills. They can even range up to the Mountain snow line at over 5,000 m (16,000 ft) in elevation.", "title": "On Location: The Spectacled Bear", "publishedDate": "2012-08-26T03:06:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "5cCM7cWfHJg", "description": "Do\u011fu T\u00fcrkistan Milli Mar\u015f\u0131", "title": "Do\u011fu T\u00fcrkistan Milli Mar\u015f\u0131", "publishedDate": "2012-02-03T13:41:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "5cCUgKiwUyY", "description": "For a refutation of Habib Ali Jafri type into youtube search, \"Sheikh Fawzan Habib Jifri\".

In the past many Metis spoke up to five or six languages, including Michif, French, English, Cree, Ojibway and Bungee.\n \nHistorically, the Metis were the lifeblood of the west.  Their ability to communicate in so many languages was incredibly useful in the many occupations of the Metis.  The Metis were the voyageurs, the buffalo hunters, boatmen, fisherman, traders, small business owners, lumbermen, farmers, cattlemen and of course, highly regarded interpreters. To this day many Metis people still speak or understand multiple languages.\n \n\"The M\u00e9tis also have a long tradition of adapting aspects of First Nations and European culture to better suit their needs.  Language is no exception.  The languages most widely used by the Prairie M\u00e9tis people were Michif-French, Michif-Cree and Bungee.  The first language is a dialect of Prairie French; the second is a distinct language like no other in the world.  All the nouns and associated grammar are Plains Cree.  These are both very unique adaptations of the Metis people.  Bungee or Bungi (see M Stobie, 1968; and E. Blain. 1989, 1994), a now extinct language, consisted of Gaelic and Cree mixed with French and Saulteaux.\"\n \nDeconstructing M\u00e9tis Historiography: Giving Voice to the M\u00e9tis People, L.

Foliage is a mass noun that refers to leaves as a feature of plants.[1][2]\nTypically a leaf is a thin, flattened organ borne above ground and specialized for photosynthesis, but many types of leaves are adapted in ways almost unrecognisable in those terms: some are not flat (for example many succulent leaves and conifers), some are not above ground (such as bulb scales), and some are without major photosynthetic function (consider for example cataphylls, spines, and cotyledons).\n\nConversely, many structures of non-vascular plants, or even of some lichens, which are not plants at all (in the sense of being members of the kingdom Plantae), do look and function much like leaves.

The troy ounce is 480 grains.\n\nThe weight of the barley is used as reference since Antiquity.\nFor example, in ancient Moslem world, was used the mithqal as unit of mass, particularly for precious metals.\nAccording Ibn Khaldun (15th century historian), the dinar (a gold coin) was considered to have the weight of one mithqal, which, was equivalent to seventy-two grains of barley.\nOn the other hand , the dirham (a silver coin) is that ten of which equal in weight seven mithqal of gold, so the weight of a dirham of silver equals 7/10 the weight of a dinar.\nBut, what are the weight of the mithq\u00e1l in grams?\n\nLet us see ... 4,76g !

Through the principle of various solid contaminants have different sedimentation rate in liquid, spiral classifier cleansing thebination of ore and certifying them.\n\n The coarser ore goes to the heap leach, where the copper is subjected to a dilute sulfuric acid solution to dissolve the copper. Then the leach solution containing the dissolved copper is subjected to a process called solvent extraction (SX). The SX process concentrates and purifies the copper leach solution so the copper can be recovered at a high electrical current efficiency by the electrowinning cells.\n\n The extracted Copper ore should be crushed by jaw crusher initially. When it gets the reasonable fineness, it is transported into ball mill by elevating conveyer and feeder, and is milled by ball mill. The subtle milled ore gets the next procedure: classification. There is a theory that if the weights of solid particles are different, the sedimentations will be different, and the mixed ore can be classified by screw classifier.\n\n VSI5X Crusher ProjectTransport in addition to Commercial Ltd (TCL) is one of the most seasoned and most important quarries in themunity.

All I actually do is sit as a member of the committee and play my part in the organisation of a meeting and that is all I have ever done.\" \n\nMr Clarke said he had never spoken before in the Commons \"to answer questions on behalf of a private organisation for which the British government has absolutely no responsibility whatever\". \n\nThose attending the meeting go there an \"off-the-record, informal discussion\" but have no intention to \"plot\" or \"decide anything\", Mr Clarke said. \n\n\"With the greatest respect, this is total, utter nonsense,\" he added. \n\nThe minister was answering an urgent question in the Commons from Michael Meacher, the Labour MP and former minister, who asked why no official statement had been made about the discussions at the meeting. \n\nRead more: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10111158/Bilderberg-Ken-Clarke-forgot-he-was-a-trustee-of-funding-group.html\n\nGet the latest headlines http://www.telegraph.co.uk/\n\nSubscribe to The Telegraph http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...\n\nLike us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/telegraph.co.uk\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/telegraph\nFollow us on Google+ https://plus.google.com/1028913550727...\n\nTelegraph.co.uk and YouTube.com/TelegraphTV are websites of The Daily Telegraph, the UK's best-selling quality daily newspaper providing news and analysis on UK and world events, business, sport, lifestyle and culture.", "title": "Ken Clarke 'forgets' he is trustee of Bilderberg funding group", "publishedDate": "2013-06-10T21:37:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "5dCMLKTSr84", "description": "Whether you\u2019re in a relationship or not, dealing with a man can be difficult.

Dat doet Quercus op basis van ATEX richtlijnen (ATEX 95 en ATEX 137), de NEN EN IEC 60079 (NEN EN IEC 60079-10, NEN EN IEC 60079-14, NEN EN IEC 60079-17) en het Arbobesluit. Quercus maakt en houdt personeel competent, zodat zij hun werk veilig kunnen uitvoeren in gebieden met een verhoogd risico op gas- en stofexplosies. Denk daarbij aan het installeren en monteren van elektrisch materieel, onderhoud aan elektrotechnische installaties of elektrotechnische inspecties in explosieve atmosferen.\n\nElektro- en instrumentatiepersoneel houden wij competent door middel van CompEx trainingen. CompEx is d\u00e9 wereldwijde oplossing voor het valideren en certificeren van kerncompetenties van personeel in de olie-, gas- en chemische sector. \n\nDe Compex cursussen bestaan uit theorie en praktijk. En worden afgesloten met een examen en CompEx certificaat. Compex bestaat momenteel uit 12 modules en een opfristraining. Quercus biedt momenteel modules Ex 01 tot en met Ex 04 en de CompEx refresher (Ex 01R t/m Ex 04R):\n\n\u2022 Ex-01 gericht op montage van Ex d, e, n en p apparatuur en componenten.\n\u2022 Ex 02 gericht op inspectie en onderhoud van Ex d, e en n installaties.\n\u2022 Ex 03 gericht op montage van Ex i apparatuur en componenten.\n\u2022 Ex 04 gericht op inspectie en onderhoud van Ex i installaties.\n\nDe theorie over explosieveiligheid leren deelnemers klassikaal in \u00e9\u00e9n van onze vestigingen of op een locatie naar keuze. De theorie wordt ondersteund door praktijkvoorbeelden en demonstraties. In de theorie worden de volgende onderwerpen behandeld:\n\n\u2022 Gasexplosiegevaar;\n\u2022 LEL, UEL, ontstekingsenergie, relatieve dampdichtheid, vlampunt, ontstekingstemperatuur;\n\u2022 Referentiegassen, ontstekingsbronnen;\n\u2022 Classificatie van Ex gebieden;\n\u2022 Categorie\u00ebn apparatuur, IP klassen, beschermingswijzen;\n\u2022 Markering van apparaten;\n\u2022 ATEX 95, ATEX 137, normen, keuze apparatuur;\n\u2022 Ex e apparatuur;\n\u2022 Ex d apparatuur;\n\u2022 Ex n apparatuur;\n\u2022 Ex p apparatuur;\n\u2022 Ex i apparatuur;\n\u2022 Elektrische installaties en aarding;\n\u2022 Veiligheidsprocedures;\n\u2022 Onderhoud en inspectie aan Ex d, e en n materialen;\n\u2022 Onderhoud en inspectie aan Ex i loops.\n\nTijdens de praktijkles voeren deelnemers onder begeleiding van een deskundige docent verschillende montage-, onderhoud- en inspectieopdrachten uit. Zo zijn deelnemers bezig met het afwerken van wartels, het lezen van IEC markeringen en het inspecteren van materiaal.\n\nTen slotte worden deelnemers getoetst aan de hand van een theorie- en praktijkexamen. Voldoen ze aan de gestelde criteria? Dan zijn de competenties up-to-date en ontvangen ze een mondiaal erkend Compex certificaat. \n\nWij hebben wereldwijd een aantal vaste Compex trainingslocaties en beschikken over een mobiel CompEx practicum. Dit mobiele practicum is eenvoudig op- en af te bouwen en op elke locatie te plaatsen. De voordelen? Geen reis- en verblijfkosten,  continu\u00efteit in het bedrijfsproces en flexibiliteit in data. \n\nKies voor competentie en veiligheid.

Golf Tips said \"Wow factor: A crazy low price for a set of irons as good as more, ahem, expensive irons we've tried.\"\n\nThe Warp Speed Irons were specially designed to propel the ball faster and further than ever before, and the high C.O.R. iron face provides the ultimate in distance. Although distance is very important in an iron design, accuracy plays an even more prominent role and the Warp Speed Irons delivers here as well. These progressively designed irons, the #3 and #4-iron possess a wider body to react much like a cross between modern day hybrids, utility or driving irons for ease of play. The #5 iron and down on into the wedges appear much like a normal iron design at first glance. However, there is actually an open space between the rear wall and the unsupported, super thin specialty high COR golf iron face insert, which is devised to flex the face like a titanium driver to maximize ball speed and distance. The wide sole undercut channel further moves weight back away from the high COR irons face as well as low for added stability. The Power Play Warp Speed Irons are Hireko's most high performance face insert irons ever designed. If your goal is seeking an game improvement iron that is both longer and more accurate, the Power Play Warp Speed high cor irons should be the first choice from the Hireko line.\n\nYou can purchase the Power Play Warp Speed Irons custom made from Hireko Golf at http://www.hirekogolf.com/power-play-warp-speed-hybrid-iron-custom-assembled.html.

An example of this - an article published in 1838, which clearly shows that even in those days, the wind was considered an important source of energy.\n[Ad # inline]\nHere are some quotes that have been recorded in the past, which prove that the wind was always important in the generation of energy. Here are some quotes that have been reported in the past, which prove that the wind was always important in energy production.\n\nJohn Houghton of Cambridge, said in his article Global warming: a full briefing, \"Given the fact that it was used as a form of energy, for several centuries, the wind is very common source of energy. Fact that there were about 10,000 windmills to identify wind energy in 1800, just goes to show that the wind has been an important source of energy in parts of Europe as the UK. therefore not surprising that part of the world, some countries of Western Europe, such as the UK and Denmark and some countries in western North America trying to revive the ways of engaging the energy of the wind. thin, and more effective facilities have replaced windmills to identify wind energy. '\n\nEven other researchers from Cambridge working on this issue. Even other researchers from Cambridge working on this subject. Vaclav Smeal in our strength paper wrote: \"The windmills in the 19th century, which were at par with the mills in this period due to the power units were of different designs. Vaclav Smeal his energies paper wrote, 'Windmills in the 19th century, which were at par with the watermills that period relative to production capacity, had a different design. They were used on farms and at railway stations. They were used in farms and at railway stations. Prior to this, after the mill of 1.5 and 6 kW and tower mills from 5 to 10 kW have been used in Europe for this purpose. \"Before that, postal plants 1.5 and 6 kW and tower plants 5 - 10 kW used in Europe for this purpose. '\n\nStudies tend to indicate that although the use of windmills for power began in China, soon spread to parts of Europe, like England in the 12th century and the end of the century, there were 12,000 factories in the region, which needs a bit of water to generate electricity to meet the huge industry requirements. Research tends to indicate that, although the use of windmills to generate energy from China, it soon spread to parts of Europe like England in the 12th century and the end of the century there were 12,000 factories in the region, which was in need of a little water to generate electricity to meet the huge industrial demand.\n\nOther researchers windmill\n[Ad # line 2]\nOther researchers and historians, as Cynthia Shih, in his article of renewable energy, said that other European countries, such as the Danish industry at a certain time to use wind power to meet the \u00bc-th of its energy needs. Other researchers and historians like Cynthia Shea in her paper Renewable Energy: Today's Contribution Tomorrow's Promise points out that other European economies as the Danish industry at a particular time using wind energy to meet the \u00bc-th power of their needs.\n\nIn the United States, the policy while stating it to former President George W.

The family was soon extended to include the A321 (first delivered 1994), the A319 (1996), and the A318 (2003). The A320 family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire flight control systems in a commercial aircraft. It was also the first, and currently the only, narrow body aircraft in the Airbus lineup.\n\nWith over 4,000 built and an additional 2,400 on order as of November 2009, the Airbus A320 family is Airbus's best-selling aircraft to date.

I felt I'd never done one and HAD to since it fell on a Tuesday this year. Anyways, I was worried initially that this song's immense charm was rooted in it's repetitiveness and I'd have a hard time expanding upon it. Where yeah, it's repetitive, the chords were really fun to play around with since they were essentially just octaves in the original. Where the color could be added was the fun part. I almost wish because of the progression of the melody that I did this for St. Patricks day or something because it's very Irish dance in a way! Oh well, I think it worked well as song choice.\n\nI've been reading all your comments guys, something I don't see many people at almost 100k subscribers (!!!???) doing. The biggest concern, which I agree with, last week was the weakness in the Rhythm guitar. I've been struggling to get all my tones back to where they were before, but even better. People have been saying that my lead and bass are fine, but the rhythm hasn't really matched and I whole-heartedly agree. This time I tried to emphasize the lower mids almost dramatically compared to my other rhythm tones. I think it was a step in the right direction but, it's not yet appealing to my ears yet. Remember guys, these video are and have always been exercises for me to get better at this stuff. I don't claim to be amazing, but I want to get there someday!\n\nNext week is an old favorite.

In STAP, strong external stimuli such as a transient low-pH stressor reprogrammed mammalian somatic cells, resulting in the generation of pluripotent cells. Through real-time imaging of STAP cells derived from purified lymphocytes, as well as gene rearrangement analysis, we found that committed somatic cells give rise to STAP cells by reprogramming rather than selection. STAP cells showed a substantial decrease in DNA methylation in the regulatory regions of pluripotency marker genes. Blastocyst injection showed that STAP cells efficiently contribute to chimaeric embryos and to offspring via germline transmission. We also demonstrate the derivation of robustly expandable pluripotent cell lines from STAP cells. Thus, our findings indicate that epigenetic fate determination of mammalian cells can be markedly converted in a context-dependent manner by strong environmental cues.\n\nb). Bidirectional developmental potential in reprogrammed cells with acquired pluripotency\nNature 505, 676--680 (30 January 2014) doi:10.1038/nature12969\nhttp://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v505/n7485/full/nature12969.html\n\nAbstract \nWe recently discovered an unexpected phenomenon of somatic cell reprogramming into pluripotent cells by exposure to sublethal stimuli, which we call stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP). This reprogramming does not require nuclear transfer or genetic manipulation. Here we report that reprogrammed STAP cells, unlike embryonic stem (ES) cells, can contribute to both embryonic and placental tissues, as seen in a blastocyst injection assay. Mouse STAP cells lose the ability to contribute to the placenta as well as trophoblast marker expression on converting into ES-like stem cells by treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In contrast, when cultured with Fgf4, STAP cells give rise to proliferative stem cells with enhanced trophoblastic characteristics. Notably, unlike conventional trophoblast stem cells, the Fgf4-induced stem cells from STAP cells contribute to both embryonic and placental tissues in vivo and transform into ES-like cells when cultured with LIF-containing medium. Taken together, the developmental potential of STAP cells, shown by chimaera formation and in vitro cell conversion, indicates that they represent a unique state of pluripotency.", "title": "Acid bath offers easy path to stem cells", "publishedDate": "2014-01-30T21:23:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "5e9-LjWlKB8", "description": "Check out my chanell here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIXByJQWksnu6S3tdVO6pkA", "title": "WAYNE A MORGAN AND CHARLOTTE  MORGAN COXIE WOXIE DIXIE BIRD", "publishedDate": "2013-01-03T23:32:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "5e91GwtRuZk", "description": "Parts, tools and more free guides are at http://portatronics.com", "title": "How to repair the Digitizer or LCD latch on an iPad 3", "publishedDate": "2013-04-13T23:35:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "5e93TyGXn_0", "description": "No One Lives Forever 8-Bit Theme", "title": "No One Lives Forever 8-Bit Theme", "publishedDate": "2009-08-09T07:10:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "5e9AQjF3svU", "description": "AQUNEWB\n100 gallon glass tank update, Convict cichlid parents with babies.", "title": "100 gallon glass fish tank update convict cichlid parents and babies", "publishedDate": "2013-02-21T10:30:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "5e9RkBtvJv4", "description": "Stone Sour's video for 'Sillyworld' from the album, Come What(ever) May - available now on Roadrunner Records.

At the same time, Adrenaline release causes significant vasoconstriction throughout the body, which increases blood pressure. Noradrenaline acts to counter the effect of Adrenaline, that is, to decrease both the heartrate and respiratory rate, and to lower blood pressure. Cortisol acts to increase the release of sugar into the bloodstream, as well as, to increase insulin production, and its' availability for the heightened metabolic state. This permits the body to adapt to the increased need for energy during a metabolic emergency. The Suprarenal Glands have both sympathetic and parasympathetic  networks which respond directly to inputs from the central nervous system.

I think its amazing that godzilla holds such a symbol because it carries a legacy of the events of japans history in ww2, though it may have been a horrible thing since innocent people died, but it still is a good quick realization of what happened to japan in an instant.

They can be seen anywhere in the world during any season, but they are not always obvious or bright. Sundogs are best seen and are most conspicuous when the sun is low.\n\nSundogs are formed by plate-shaped hexagonal ice crystals in high and cold cirrus clouds or, during very cold weather, by ice crystals called diamond dust drifting in the air at low levels. These crystals act as prisms, bending the light rays passing through them by 22\u00b0. If the crystals are randomly oriented, a complete ring around the sun is seen \u2014 a halo. But often, as the crystals sink through the air they become vertically aligned, so sunlight is refracted horizontally \u2014 in this case, sundogs are seen.\n\nAs the sun rises higher, the rays passing through the crystals are increasingly skewed from the horizontal plane. Their angle of deviation increases and the sundogs move further from the sun.[2] However, they always stay at the same altitude as the sun.\n\nSundogs are red-colored at the side nearest the sun. Farther out the colors grade through oranges to blue. However, the colors overlap considerably and so are muted, never pure or saturated. The colors of the sundog finally merge into the white of the parhelic circle (if the latter is visible).", "title": "Double Sundog, a complete parhelion", "publishedDate": "2010-12-11T19:13:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "5eJ2g6tLRrk", "description": "Briggs Rauscher reaction.

How and why insect wings developed, however, is not well understood, largely due to the scarcity of appropriate fossils from the period of their development in the Lower Carboniferous. Three main theories on the origins of insect flight are that wings developed from paranotal lobes, extensions of the thoracic terga; that they are modifications of movable abdominal gills as found on aquatic naiads of mayflies; or that they developed from thoracic protrusions used as radiators.\n\nReal Science:\nInsect flight can be extremely fast, maneuverable and versatile. This flight is possible due to the changing shape, extraordinary control and variable motion of the insect wing. Insect orders use different flight mechanisms, for example, the flight of a butterfly can be explained using steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics and thin aerofoil theory.

It is a special unit of an electrical charge.       One ampere-hour is a charge transmitted via conductor cross section per 1 hour with 1\u0410 current.       Charged 1A/h battery may theoretically provide 1A current per 1 hour. Practically, too high battery discharge current may decrease energy output. It decreases operating time of a current and may result in overheating.       Milliampere-hour is a derived unit widely used to specify capacity of small batteries.       Ampere-hour value may be reduced to Coulomb in-system unit of charge. Since 1 Coulomb is equal to 1 Ampere-second, we may calculate that 1 Amper-hour will be equal to 3000 Coulomb.       Some battery manufacturers specify values only in Milliampere-hour, while other manufacturers specify values in Watt-hour. If you know voltage, you may reduce Milliampere-hour to Watt-hour according to the formula.", "title": "Ampere-Hour", "publishedDate": "2012-02-09T01:01:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "5eSsO2NVrek", "description": "This mini-nursery consists of native Philippine tree species like Diospyros blancoi (kamagong), Dillenia philippinensis (catmon), Antidesma ghaesembilla (binayuyu), Bauhinia malabarica (alibangbang), etc.", "title": "FUTURE PHILIPPINE FOREST (MAY MOTHER NATURE REMOVE LOGGERS FROM THE GENE POOL)", "publishedDate": "2012-01-14T12:57:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "5eTGQikijuE", "description": "Hyperthermia by Chuck Macist \n\nWebsite: http://www.chuckmacist.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/chuckmacist\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/chuckmacist\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DailyNewzEntertainmentLLC\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/Chuckmacist_AKA_ChuckMac\nMTV: http://www.mtv.com/artists/chuck-macist\nContact: DailyNewzEntertainment@gmail.com\n\nWatch \"Hyperthermia by Chuck Macist\" on WorldStarHipHop.com: http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshh4D7Pnyi1TzcEedH3\n\n\"Whatever It Takes\" EP by Chuck Macist on iTunes.

Seriously.\nNearly 350 years after us Brits abolished the licensing of the press, whereby every publisher had to get the blessing of the government before he could press and promote his ideas, a new system of licensing is being proposed.

A little bit about both:\n\nA rail gun uses the Lorenz force caused by the electricity going through the rails to linearly accelerate an armature that may either be the bullet or a thing that pushes the bullet. A plasma rail gun simply uses a plasma stream as the armature, this reduces welding issues (I vaporized some aluminum foil to generate the plasma).\n\n\nA coil gun (or Gauss gun) uses a strong magnetic pulse to pull a bullet forward. While in theory less efficient than a rail gun, in this case it is far more efficient. Multiple stages triggered by sensors can increase efficiency as well as the power of the gun, since once a bullet is saturated by the magnetic field it will not move faster with more power going through the coil.

Skin cream, a cigarette butt and a can of root beer can also be seen.\n\nNothing is significant about the picture other than it has never been released. The remaining pictures, police say, are simply duplicates of pictures already released.\n\nCobain's death still captivates people around the world, even the conspiracy theorists who believe the grunge music star and front man for Nirvana was murdered.\n\nDetectives have found no new evidence to suggest this was anything but a suicide.\n\nOn April 8, it will be 20 years since Cobain was found dead in his home on Lake Washington Boulevard East.
