Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with many more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.\nWhen King Cobra Attack", "title": "When King Cobra Attack", "publishedDate": "2014-10-29T15:37:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "0OY8XXZ98rw", "description": "poetaster_and_singing_dolls_ Gakupo + KAITO version by maya & \u85e4\u4ee3\u53f6 (Fujishiro Kanae), original song by hazyP\nFrom Nico: http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm8522045\nOriginal Miku version: http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm6230352\n\u4f5c\u8a5e\u30fb\u4f5c\u66f2\uff1ahazyP \n\u7de8\u66f2\u30fb\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u30fbMIX\uff1amaya\n\u52d5\u753b\u30fb\u8abf\u6559\uff1a\u85e4\u4ee3\u53f6\n\"Poetaster, like rhymester or versifier, is a contemptuous name often applied to bad or inferior poets.

First, get instructions from the doctor about what type of insulin to use, how often you'll need to inject it, and how to properly handle it.\nWhen preparing the insulin shot, allow it to reach room temperature. Gather everything you'll need: the insulin bottle, a syringe with a new needle, an alcohol wipe, and an opaque, heavy-duty plastic container with a lid for discarding the syringe and needle when you're finished. Always wash your hands thoroughly. To fill the syringe, first wipe the rubber cover of the bottle with alcohol, and then prepare the syringe by pulling back on the plunger to fill the syringe with air. You want to fill the syringe with the same amount of air as the amount of insulin you'll need for that dose. Next, stick the needle through the rubber cover and into the top of the bottle. Press down on the plunger to inject the air into the bottle, and turn the bottle upside-down, making sure the tip of the needle is in the insulin. Pull back the plunger slowly until you have just a bit more insulin than you need for your dose. Check the syringe for air bubbles by holding it straight up and tapping it gently (the bubbles should rise up toward the insulin bottle). Your syringe is now ready for use.\nNext, clean the injection site with alcohol and allow it to dry thoroughly. The belly, back of the upper arm, the upper buttocks, and outer thighs are good injection options, but remember to avoid the two inches of skin around the belly button. Pinch about an inch of skin. Hold the needle at a 90-degree angle to the skin and push it in completely. Once the needle is in place, slowly push on the plunger to inject the insulin. After the plunger is completely depressed, hold the needle in place for five seconds to prevent leaking, and dispose of the needle and syringe as soon as you're finished.\nI hope this will help you when giving insulin shots. If you have any questions, talk to your CVS pharmacist. We're here to help.\n\nSource: CVS Caremark Health Resources", "title": "How do I properly give an insulin shot?", "publishedDate": "2009-12-17T15:27:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "0OlLW-LzXHc", "description": "Discover the #FortuneTraveller playlist here: http://po.st/d7XJk5\nS\u00e9an VS MOROCCO coming up this week !!! \n\nTurkish Airlines have given 10 top YouTubers the opportunity to travel to stunning secret locations around the world and to share their experiences in their own inimitable style.

For two years, they devoted their days to constructing their dream studio and spent their nights performing songs by The Police, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones at local pubs to pay the bills. \"We really got down and dirty with dry walling and literally laying the floorboards, and at the same time we were taking a couple of days a week to focus on writing songs,\" recalls Keith Jeffery, Atlas Genius's vocalist/guitarist. \"We had a lot of song ideas and it was important to us to have our own studio where we could experiment and hone in on our sound,\" adds brother and drummer, Michael Jeffery. The studio was designed and outfitted by the brothers with the help of their father (who comes from a music and engineering background). Once the studio was complete, the first song that Atlas Genius finished was a song called \"Trojans,\" which they wrote, recorded and produced in collaboration with their friend, keyboardist Darren Sell. After many weeks tweaking the song, Michael insisted that the song was ready to be heard outside of the studio walls. Within an hour, \"Trojans\" was on the Triple J Unearthed Website, SoundCloud, and for sale via TuneCore on iTunes, Amazon and Spotify worldwide.\n\nQuickly named an iTunes Single of the Week in Australia and New Zealand, \"Trojans\" reached #4 on Hype Machine by the end of May. In August, SiriusXM Satellite Radio's Alt-Nation discovered the song on a blog and decided to give it some spins. There was an immediate reaction from listeners, and in September, \"Trojans\" was placed into heavy rotation, where it maintained a top-five position on the listener-generated Alt-18 countdown and peaked at number one for 4 consecutive weeks in January 2012. \"Trojans\" began selling over a thousand tracks per week on U.S. iTunes and soon climbed to 45,000 sales - all with zero promotional efforts from the still-unsigned Atlas Genius.\n\nThe band's first release from their new label home, the EP Through The Glass (produced, engineered and mixed by the band), came out in June of 2012. With Through The Glass completed, Atlas Genius then holed up in its studio and worked on writing and recording its first full-length album, while at the same time rehearsing for their first ever tour.

A negative result generates further tests. With the Rheonix panel, patients can be tested for an array of diseases simultaneously yielding a quick diagnosis and rapid treatment. \nThe Rheonix panel is driven by a micro-spotted array of capture probes embedded in the Rheonix CARD. Up to 48 probes can be used to develop a powerful panel of information.  \nHere's how the microarray works:\n1. The first step is to denature the biotinylated amplicons, which result from PCR amplification.  This is accomplished through the addition of precisely controlled temperature. \n2. The denatured amplicons are passed over the capture probes where complimentary bonding between base pairs of the probe and amplicon result in target capture.  \n3. Finally, the bonded pairs are washed to remove excess amplicons and any waste material.  \n4. The streptavidin, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, attaches to the biotin.  This arms the complex preparing it for detection.  \n5. Excess is removed.  The Streptavidin Horseradish Peroxidase conjugated probe and amplicon pairs remain for visualization. \n6. The final step adds tetra methyl benzidine, a chromogenic substrate, which when activated by horseradish peroxidase, forms a blue spot on the microarray indicating target capture.  \nIn this example, the TMB reveals the presence of Rhinovirus.", "title": "The Science Behind Rheonix EncompassMDx", "publishedDate": "2014-01-28T22:04:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "0OuOSxgaSN0", "description": "http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/labor\n\nThe Department of Labor's budget is dominated by the costly unemployment insurance system.

For sports such as cycling and swimming, men started shaving their legs around the turn of the 20th Century. Most male swimmers, bicycle racers, and some male non-racers shave their legs regularly. The practice is most useful in long distance swimming, where the effects of drag can cause a significant time difference in races over 400 meters. There's no objective evidence to support the practice in cycling, and little common agreement as to its rationale, although a multitude of reasons are given. The various reasons include: faster healing and easier cleaning of road rash, less pain during leg massage, aesthetics, vanity -- by more clearly displaying leg muscles -- fitting in with cycling peers, \"feeling faster\" without the feel of wind on body hair so less drag, a sense that Lycra cycling shorts \"stick\" to the skin better with shaved legs, and a sense that the absence of leg hair assists in preventing ingrown hairs in the upper thighs from tight-fitting Lycra shorts.\nSeneca suggested that in ancient Rome it was considered an ostentatious bit of effeminacy, contrary to underarm hair removal: \"One is, I believe, as faulty as the other: the one class are unreasonably elaborate, the other are unreasonably negligent; the former depilate the leg, the latter not even the armpit\" (letter 114). Summers cites Ovid, A. A. i. 506 \"Don't rub your legs smooth with the tight-scraping pumice stone.\"\nMany athletes also shave their legs or bodies to facilitate therapeutic massage that is frequently a part of their training or post-race recovery programs. They may also shave their legs if they tape protective gear to them to prevent the tape from pulling painfully on the hair when removed. Shaving of the legs is also frequently practised by male models and bodybuilders, since it accentuates muscle definition.", "title": "Why Do Cyclists Shave Their Legs?", "publishedDate": "2013-08-23T03:41:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "0OxDtpttcS4", "description": "Daisy my cat attacking/breaking our printer.

This leaves out North Korea's two alleged nuclear tests in this past decade (the legitimacy of both of which is not 100% clear).\n\nEach nation gets a blip and a flashing dot on the map whenever they detonate a nuclear weapon, with a running tally kept on the top and bottom bars of the screen. Hashimoto, who began the project in 2003, says that he created it with the goal of showing\"the fear and folly of nuclear weapons.\" It starts really slow \u2014 if you want to see real action, skip ahead to 1962 or so \u2014 but the buildup becomes overwhelming.\n\nhttp://www.ctbto.org/specials/1945-19...\n\n\n\nMultimedia artwork\n\"2053\" - This is the number of nuclear explosions conducted in various parts of the globe.*\nProfile of the artist: Isao HASHIMOTO\nBorn in Kumamoto prefecture, Japan in 1959.\nWorked for 17 years in financial industry as a foreign exchange dealer. Studied at Department of Arts, Policy and Management of Musashino Art University, Tokyo.\nCurrently working for Lalique Museum, Hakone, Japan as a curator.\nCreated artwork series expressing, in the artist's view, \"the fear and the folly of nuclear weapons\":\n\"1945-1998\" \u00a9 2003\n\"Overkilled\"\n\"The Names of Experiments\"\nAbout \"1945-1998\" \u00a92003\n\"This piece of work is a bird's eye view of the history by scaling down a month length of time into one second. No letter is used for equal messaging to all viewers without language barrier. The blinking light, sound and the numbers on the world map show when, where and how many experiments each country have conducted. I created this work for the means of an interface to the people who are yet to know of the extremely grave, but present problem of the world.\"\nContact the artist:\nShould you have any query regarding this artwork, please contact e-mail address below:\nhashi123@amy.hi-ho.ne.jp\n* The number excludes both tests by North Korea (October 2006 and May 2009).\na great bit of work here that really should shock everyone of us.....mad scientists, mad governments and their insane oligarchy puppet masters.....who ever gave them the right to this insanity...?

The debates raged regarding the merits of the lance over the saber or vice versa. Additionally there were further disagreements in this historical arms race; every new saber developed became a compromise, with some favoring the point oriented weapon and others the edge.\nThe Prussian Militarys response was to equip their exalted cavalry with a saber that tried to strike that perfect balance between edge and point. Roll forged from high carbon steel with a spring temper, it offered a slightly curved blade with a pipe back that ran down its length to reinforce the strong spear point. Its remarkably effective pierced basket guard protected a sharkskin wrapped grip that kept this saber secure in hand while still being lively enough to be manipulated with the fingers. \nIt was a light, handy saber that cut efficiently while remaining deadly in the thrust because of the added stiffness of its pipe back cross section.\n\nCold Steels modern interpretation of this fascinating saber, like many of our swords, is rooted in the martial experience of our President, Lynn C. Thompson, acquired by countless hours of fencing with 7075 aluminum and steel replicas. \nLynn was impressed with the terrific hand, wrist, and forearm protection offered by the 1852 in addition to its superior fighting characteristics. \nOur version mimics the original almost to perfection. Everything is there; including the pipe-backed blade, the reinforced point, and the pierced steel basket guard. Even the all steel scabbard has been faithfully and meticulously duplicated to the highest possible quality. \nThe Cold Steel Prussian Saber is crafted from 1055 high carbon steel with a hard spring temper and a combat sharp edge, ready to take pride of place in your collection today!\n\nSPECS:\nBlade Length: 33\"\nOverall Length: 39\"\nSteel: 1055 Carbon\nWeight: 34.4 oz\nHandle: 6\"\nScabbard: Steel Scabbard\n\nLINK:\nhttp://www.coldsteel.com/Product/88PSA/1852_PRUSSIAN_SABER.aspx", "title": "Cold Steel - 1852 Prussian Saber", "publishedDate": "2014-07-15T16:58:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "0PAYGrCwVHk", "description": "This is my second video and i hope you like it.", "title": "Vampire knight Black Roses Red.wmv", "publishedDate": "2012-06-03T16:04:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "0PApHHiDWV8", "description": "an\u00e1lisis gta 5", "title": "An\u00e1lisis: Grand Theft Auto 5 Trailer", "publishedDate": "2011-11-03T22:06:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "0PAyqo1cE0Y", "description": "L'enl\u00e8vement jeudi 10 octobre du Premier ministre libyen par des ex-rebelles met en \u00e9vidence l'impuissance de l'Etat face \u00e0 de multiples groupes arm\u00e9s, pourtant cens\u00e9s op\u00e9rer sous les ordres des autorit\u00e9s libyennes.

The fiber is almost pure cellulose. The botanical purpose of cotton fiber is to aid in seed dispersal.\nThe plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa.\n\nThe fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated from 5000 BC have been excavated in Mexico and Pakistan. Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that so lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today.\n\nIndian cotton scenario\nIndia was recognised as the cradle of cotton industry for over 3000 years (1500 BC to 1700 AD). India produces finest and beautiful cotton fabrics since time immemorial. India, being the earliest country in the world for domesticated cotton production and manufacture of cotton fabrics, has led today's first in cotton cultivated area and second in production among all cotton producing countries in the world next to China (as per production record in 2009 - 10).\n\nIndia is the 15th largest economy in the world with a GDP of USD3.319 trillion and a GDP per capita of USD2,900. In 2008, the textile sector contributed about 14% of industrial production, 4% of the GDP and provided direct employment to over 33 million people. The textile sector is the second largest provider of employment after agriculture. \n\nCotton is one of the principal crops of India and plays a vital role in the country's economic growth by providing substantial employment and making significant contributions to export earnings. The cotton cultivation sector not only engages around 6 million farmers, but also involved another about 40 to 50 million people relating to cotton cultivation, cotton trade and its processing. \n\nCourtesy: Wikipedia\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

To conduct a signature-based debit card transaction, the customer typically has a VISA- or MasterCard-branded debit card linked to a deposit account. As shown in figure 8, after the card is swiped, a message about the transaction travels directly (or indirectly, through the merchant's acquirer) to the VISA or MasterCard network, from which the transaction proceeds directly (or indirectly, through the card-issuing institution's processor) to the card-issuing institution. \n\nhttp://www.lendinguniverse.com/hard_money.htm Hard money definition General term for loans funded by private individuals as investors, and secured only by equity in real estate.  Hard money loans or \"hard loans\" are arranged by hard money brokers sometimes called \"hard lenders\".    As in a PIN-based debit card transaction, if the issuer verifies the relevant private investors, it authorizes the transaction and routes it back through the VISA or MasterCard network to the merchant's acquirer with the authorization. The merchant acquirer then forwards the authorization to the merchant's terminal, and the consumer signs the receipt.9 The settlement of the transaction between brokers the merchant and card issuer (and the actual debiting of the consumer's account) occurs after a second message is sent from the merchant to the issuer, usually at the end of the day.10 Figure 8: Path of a Typical Signature-Based Debit Card Transaction.\n\nGet information on  hard loans and compare lending scenarios of hard money rehab on http://www.lendinguniverse.com/  the largest lending marketplace.

Dopo un'anamnesi accurata ed una diagnosi precisa con studio emodinamico, possono essere trattate con differenti metodologie laser: esclusivamente transdermico per i vasi isolati e superficiali o in abbinamento a fotocoagulazione endoluminale sui vasi pi\u00f9 profondi (FLEBOLASER\u00ae / FTF System\u00ae - LASEmaR\u00ae).\nL'alta incidenza di recidive (+50%), induce alla continua ricerca di cure mini invasive, efficaci, senza complicanze che consentano rapidi recuperi, migliori qualit\u00e0 di vita e risultati stabili.\nLa soluzione proposta da EUFOTON per i trattamenti vascolari transdermici degli arti comprende un laser per le microectasie superficiali rosse - matting, per le pigmentazioni emosideriniche superficiali post sclerosi e per le venule a maggiore concentrazione di desossiemoglobina (colore blu). \nUna valida e moderna alternativa alla sclerosi chimica delle teleangectasie pi\u00f9 profonde non trattabili in modo transdermico \u00e8 rappresentata dalla fotosclerosi endoluminale perivenosa FLEBOLASER\u00ae / FTF System\u00ae.\n\nTrattamento transdermico\nIl trattamento laser transdermico delle teleangiectasie degli arti inferiori ha visto nel corso degli anni, uno spostamento di utilizzo delle lunghezze d'onda pi\u00f9 selettive di colore verde-giallo (532, 577, 578, 585, 590, 600 nm) scarsamente penetranti e operanti secondo il principio della fototermolisi selettiva, verso le lunghezze d'onda IRV infrarosse vicine (755, 808, 940, 980, 1064 nm) nettamente meno selettive sulle esche ottiche emoglobiniche, ma pi\u00f9 penetranti (3-4mm). Tali radiazioni, per provocare la fotocoagulazione parietale vasale, necessitano di impulsi lunghi (50-100ms) proporzionati allo spessore parietale, con un sufficiente tempo di danneggiamento termico TDT abbinando un contestuale raffreddamento epicutaneo e pi\u00f9 sedute. (2001: Estensione della fototermolisi selettiva).\nLa soluzione proposta da EUFOTON per i trattamenti vascolari transdermici degli arti comprende:\n\nLASEmaR\u00ae per le microectasie superficiali rosse -- matting, per le pigmentazioni emosideriniche superficiali post sclerosi.\nLASEmaR\u00ae  per il trattamento transdermico delle venule a maggiore concentrazione di deossiemoglobina (colore blu). Una valida e moderna alternativa alla sclerosi chimica delle teleangectasie pi\u00f9 profonde non trattabili in modo transdermico \u00e8 rappresentata dalla fotocoagulazione endo-perivenosa - \nMetodo combinato endo - transdermico (FLEBOLASER\u00ae / FTF System\u00ae)\n\nTelangiectases are venous, arterial and arteriovenous capillary dilations of the dermal subpapillary plexus. In most cases they indicate a peripheral varicose disease . After an accurate anamnesis and a precise diagnosis by a hemodynamic analysis, they can be treated with different laser methodologies: Exclusively transdermal application for isolated and superficial vessels or in association with endoluminal photocoagulation on deeper vessels (FLEBOLASER\u2122 - LASEmaR\u2122).\nThe high incidence of recurrences (+50%) induces to the continuous research for minimally invasive treatments without complications, which ensure quick recoveries, better quality of life and stable results.\nThe solution proposed by EUFOTON for the vascular transdermal treatments of limbs include a laser for superficial red microectasis, matting, for the post-sclerosis hemosiderin superficial pigmentations and for the transdermal treatment of venules at higher concentration of deoxyhemoglobin (blue colored). A valid and modern alternative to chemical sclerosis of deeper telangiectases which can not be transdermally treated, is the endoluminal perivenous photosclerosis, FLEBOLASER\u2122.\n\nTransdermal Treatment\nThe transdermal laser treatment of telangiectases of the lower limbs, which has required over the last years poorly penetrating and more selective wavelengths of yellow\u2014green color (532, 577, 578, 585, 590, 600 nm) working according to the principle of selective photothermolysis, has changed to close infrared IRV wavelengths (755,808,940,980,1064nm) which are considerably less selective on the hemoglobin optic baits, but more penetrating (3-4mm). To perform the vessel parietal photocoagulation, these radiations need long pulses (50-100ms) depending on the parietal thickness, with a sufficient thermal damaging time (TDT) associated to a local epicutaneous cooling and more sessions.

It's best not to overeat but I know sometimes temptations win. So for those of you who may overeat including myself, I'm going to show you three acupressure points that are good for heartburn, acid reflux, bloating from gas and indigestion.\n\nP6 -- It's located inside of the wrist two and a half finger widths from the wrist crease. You can press this point for one minute as you breathe deeply. Use a hooked thumb for a firm pressure. This point is especially good if you are feeling sick and nauseous from overeating. \n\nCV6 -- It's located two finger widths below the belly button. You can press this point with fingertips. If the fingertip is too much, you can just press with your palm. Again press this point for one minute as you focus on deep breathing.\n\nST25 -- They are located three closed finger widths next and parallel to the belly button. You can press these points for one minute as you breathe deeply.\n\nYou can also massage your tummy by making circles in clockwise motion which is the direction of digestion. You will notice as you makes circles around the belly button you are stimulating those acupressure points.\n\nIf you are interested in acupressure points to control appetite, click here: http://youtu.be/Ltp248L37_0\n\nHave a safe and happy Thanksgiving.\n\nHappy Massaging! \n\nMassage Monday 11-19-12: Acupressure points for heartburn, acid reflux, bloating and indigestion http://youtu.be/0PZctWw4P9I", "title": "Acupressure points for heartburn, acid reflux, bloating & indigestion - Massage Monday 11-19-12", "publishedDate": "2012-11-19T22:45:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "0PZdnjZ__-s", "description": "", "title": "Flower Mist (HW) - guitar", "publishedDate": "2011-09-27T06:39:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "0P_FxPj50N8", "description": "Watch Jay, our Technical Manager, explain how Bytes make sure our new customers are on the best Check Point plan for them.", "title": "Reasons to Byte - Supporting New Customers", "publishedDate": "2013-06-25T15:57:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Pa-CfZrStQ", "description": "", "title": "\u3010God Eater\u3011\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30a4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc Rank 9 Dyaus Pita \u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30a6\u30b9\u30fb\u30d4\u30bf\u30fc", "publishedDate": "2010-06-27T08:06:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Pa0SurK_Zk", "description": "West Bromwich Albion head coach Alan Irvine previews his first Barclays Premier League game in charge of the club against Sunderland at The Hawthorns on Saturday.\n\nOfficialAlbion is your one-stop hub for West Bromwich Albion Football Club video content.

It may refer to only the mansion (the 340-room main building) that has the President's official residence and offices; it may also refer to the entire 130 hectare (320 acre) President Estate that includes huge gardens (Mughal Gardens), residences of bodyguards and staff, other offices, stables and open spaces. The Rashtrapati Bhavan is a large and vast mansion with four floors and has 340 rooms. It is built on a floor area of 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2). It faces east. A straight east-west road, Rajpath (called King's Way or Kingsway by the British), starts from the huge square, Vijay Chowk, in front of Rashtrapati Bhavan and ends at India Gate on the western end of the road. North Avenue and South Avenue are two approach roads north and south of the estate in perfect symmetry. The east-west road (Rajpath) out of the Rashtrapati Bhawan is flanked by the two huge Central Secretariat buildings (North and South Blocks) that house various ministries of the Government of India. The Parliament House is located at eastern end of North Block.\n\nThe plan of the building is designed around a massive square with multiple courtyards and open inner areas within. The plan called for two wings; one for the Viceroy and residents and another for guests. The residence wing is a separate four-storey house in itself, with its own court areas within. This wing was so large that the first Indian governor-general, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, opted to live the smaller guest wing, a tradition that has since been followed by subsequent presidents. The original residence wing is now used primarily for state receptions and as a guest wing for visiting heads of state.\n\nThe centre of the main wing of the building, underneath the main dome, is the Durbar Hall, which was known as the Throne Room during British rule when it had thrones for the Viceroy and Vicereine (his wife). The interior of this room and almost all the rooms of the palace are bare, relying on stonework and shapes to show austerity rather than intricate decoration. In the hall, the columns are made in Delhi order which combines vertical lines with the motif of a bell. The vertical lines from the column were also used in the frieze around the room, which could not have been done with one of the traditional Greek orders of columns. The hall has a 2-ton chandelier which hangs from a 33-metre height. The two state drawing rooms, the state supper room and the state library are each on the four corners of the hall. \n\nThere are also other rooms such as many loggias (galleries with open air on one side) which face out into the courtyards, a large dining hall with an extremely long table, sitting rooms, billiards rooms, and a large ball room, and staircases.

Dr. David Kenneth Wheaton Ph.D. Read by Jodi Behan. \u00a9 Rev. Dr. David Kenneth Wheaton Ph.D. \n--\nThe theme of the morning walk was discipline. There are four types of discipline:\nI. Discipline of the body.\n2. Discipline of emptying the contents of mind.\n3. Discipline of the Spirit.\n4. Discipline of consciousness.\n\nDiscipline of the body is familiar to many people. As we grow up, we discipline our body in many different ways. We learned to prolong hunger and to contain our natural bodily functions. We also discipline our bodies in various forms of sporting activities. We go to the gym. We discipline our sleep habits. We learn not to overeat and to control our sexual urges. We also approach the discipline of the employing of the mind in many different ways. We take courses on how to improve our memory and concentration. We learn how to do new things. We look for and practice activities that will assist us in the discipline of concentration and focus, so eventually we will have no-mind (Nacta).\n\nOur mind also contains our emotions. We now know that emotions are made of chemicals. The more we discipline our minds, the more that the various  neurotransmitters in the brain (which are chemical also) change. Our ability to discipline our emotions is reflected in our character and in our spiritual consciousness. Character traits such as self-control, even temperedness,\nkindness, gentleness, patience and others are enhanced by a continuous disciplining of our emotions and the deepening of our spiritual consciousness. We should not mistake this for the notion of repression of emotions. It is about learning how to bridal our emotions and to understand them in the context of spiritual awareness.\n\nSpiritual discipline is achieved through a number of different methods. People who come from an organized religion orientation use certain methods they are comfortable with to expand and deepen their spiritual awareness. There are a number of paths that lead to the same end. Contemplation, meditation, prayer, ritual, dance, study, workshops, and retreats are examples of such methods. This list is by no means complete.\n\nSpiritual consciousness uses a variety of all the universal spiritual principles to teach that discipline is a central ingredient for spiritual awareness. Spirituality is not a list of things to believe or doctrines to follow. Rather, spiritual awareness is inconclusive and not exclusive. Central to spiritual awareness is the affirmation of and commitment to non-judgment, acceptance of mystery, worship and veneration (adoration), and love of self and others. It is different than just consciousness in general. One can be an atheist, an agnostic, a liberal, a fundamentalist, a moderate, or any other type, brand or identity and still be spiritually aware.\n\nFrom Journey with a Modern Mystic written by Rev.

They committed monstrous crimes unprecedented in human history.\n    However, they could not bring to their knees the army and people of the DPRK who turned out as one in the war to protect the freedom and independence of the country, national sovereignty and the gains of the revolution true to the wise leadership of President Kim Il Sung.\n    They have gone frantic with the moves for a new war to stifle the DPRK, far from drawing a due lesson from the ignominious defeat they suffered in the Korean war.\n    The speaker called upon all service personnel and people to achieve the final victory in the confrontation with the U.S. which lasted for several decades, accomplish the historic cause of national reunification, step up the building of a thriving socialist nation and thus complete the revolutionary cause of Juche to the last.\n    Representatives of workers, agricultural workers and youth and students evinced their resolution to give the fullest play to the bolstered-up might of Songun and vent the pent-up resentment and thus drive the aggressors out of this land and achieve the historic cause of national reunification without fail if the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet group hurt the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK even a bit.\n    Then followed a demonstration.\n    The demonstrators marched past the square, holding such placards reading \"Let's force the U.S. imperialists to pay dearly for the blood shed by Koreans!\" and \"Let's take thousands-fold revenge upon the U.S. imperialist aggressors!\" -0-", "title": "Mass Rally in North Korea Marks Day of Struggle against U.S. Imperialism", "publishedDate": "2014-06-25T17:25:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Q1MJYuh1Qo", "description": "Ustaz Azhar Idrus, UAI - Muhammadun atau Muhammadan?", "title": "Ustaz Azhar - Muhammadun atau Muhammadan?", "publishedDate": "2013-12-08T08:54:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Q1PBotzTck", "description": "I've had some people asking about how the shields work and how my belt locks together so I took this quick, crappy video to show you.\n\nTo find out more about my belt visit www.lockedlali.com", "title": "LockedLali's My-Steel Chastity Belt.", "publishedDate": "2012-06-24T05:51:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Q1exgpGQyE", "description": "The official video for \"That Sleigh\" (Tiny Truths) by Steve Folk (ex Blabbermouth).\nFilmed from a canal boat window in Camden, there are no actors, these are real \"passers by\", who simply stopped for a chat.\n\nAvailable for Free Download at https://soundcloud.com/blabbermouthmusic/that-sleigh-free-download\n\nwww.stevefolk.com for contact", "title": "That Sleigh (Tiny Truths)", "publishedDate": "2012-12-09T21:19:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Q1nQ1lKNtE", "description": "Thanks for watching our Skyrim Mod Spotlight!\nSupport us on http://patreon.com/brodual\nLike us on Facebook! http://facebook.com/brodual\nFollow us on Twitter! http://twitter.com/brodual\n\nCheck out the official YouTube Channel here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llvcBLnzuVQ\n\nCheck out the forums here:\nhttp://tesrenewal.com/\nhttps://tesrenewal.com/forums/skywind-development-forums\nBe sure to offer your help if you can!\n\nFor some Skywind music check out:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/squallydabeanz/sets\n\nIntro/Outro Music:\nhttp://machinimasound.com/\nCC BY 3.0 - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "title": "TESV: Skywind - Progress", "publishedDate": "2014-11-02T05:29:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Q1oIVzt9eo", "description": "Property Site: http://tour.circlepix.com/home/9KC7ZT\n\nBeautiful well maintained 2 story home located in the sought-out community of Cypress Springs.

WIR FORDERN EIN VERBOT ALLER CHEMTRAIL- SPR\u00dcHAKTIONEN. WIR FORDERN EIN VERBOT VON CLIMATE- ENGENEERING.\nEine Recherche des amerikanischen Fernsehnachrichtensenders KSLA News ergab, dass Substanzen, die aus Chemtrails in gro\u00dfer H\u00f6he auf die Erde herabgefallen waren, erhebliche Mengen an Barium (6,8 ppm) und Blei (8,2 ppm) sowie Spuren anderer chemischer Substanzen wie Arsen, Chrom, Kadmium, Selen und Silber enthielten. Mit einer Ausnahme handelt es sich bei allen diesen Substanzen um Metalle; einige von ihnen sind giftig, w\u00e4hrend andere selten oder nie in nat\u00fcrlichen Umgebungen vorkommen. \n.\n.\n Das Poison Control Center berichtete dar\u00fcber hinaus, wie bei jedem Kontakt mit gef\u00e4hrlichen Substanzen k\u00f6nnte ein l\u00e4ngerer Kontakt mit Barium das Immunsystem schw\u00e4chen.\nJetzt ist die Zeit des Leugnens und Abstreitens vorbei. Wissenschaftler diskutieren in aller Offenheit \u00fcber M\u00f6glichkeiten, die Sonneneinstrahlung durch ihre Geoengineering-Programme zu verringern und das Blau des Himmels durch ein dunstiges Wei\u00df zu ersetzen. Als Folge drohen weltweit D\u00fcrren und Hungersn\u00f6te. Viele Hinweise belegen, dass derartige Experimente schon seit geraumer Zeit in gro\u00dfem Umfang laufen. Selbst der britische Chefwissenschaftler von Greenpeace, Doug Parr, der zu den \u00fcberzeugten Verfechtern der These geh\u00f6rt, dass vor allem von Menschen zu verantwortende Prozesse f\u00fcr die globale Erw\u00e4rmung verantwortlich sind, bezeichnete diese Vorhaben als \u00bbhaarstr\u00e4ubend\u00ab und \u00bbgef\u00e4hrlich\u00ab. Diese Geoengineering-Agenda wird ohne Einbeziehung der \u00d6ffentlichkeit und h\u00f6hnisch ohne R\u00fccksicht auf langfristige gesundheits- und umweltsch\u00e4dliche Auswirkungen durchgezogen -- unter dem Vorwand, ein Problem -- den weltweiten Klimawandel -- zu l\u00f6sen, das sich immer mehr als grandioser Schwindel entpuppt.\nQuelle: http://www.politaia.org/umwelt-und-gesundheit/chemtrails/chemtrails-die-vergiftung-der-menschheit/\n\nCHEMTRAILS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBbJeh9Fkp4\n\nHAARP: http://german.ruvr.ru/2013_05_21/Waffen-der-Zukunft-Ionenwolken-und-Nano-Killer/\n\nGleiche \"Wirkstoffe\" bei Grippeschutzimpfungen und in Chemtrails:\nhttp://info.kopp-verlag.de/hintergruende/zeitgeschichte/mike-adams/grippeepidemie-trifft-millionen-von-amerikanern-die-gegen-die-grippe-geimpft-sind.html;jsessionid=BE4EF50E806CBFBB4829C1CC482FFB7C\n\nDie Firma Monsanto l\u00e4sst u.a.

Also read how to cure eczema naturally with proven home remedies. Learn how to cure eczema or dermatitis using natural remedies, lifestyle and diet. There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "Healing Eczema Symptoms By Knowing Yourself", "publishedDate": "2014-01-28T10:10:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "0QTogEniFXQ", "description": "Barbara demonstrates the right way to replant a hosta for best results.

This Sesame Street Cookie Monster video is part of my DisneyCarToys Cookie Monster Cozy Coupe series, where Cookie Monster rides in a cozy coupe and crashes. Same concept just snow this time. In the video, Cookie Monster says that he is not driving his Cozy Coupe today because the roads are too icy, so he takes out his snow sled instead. Cookie Monster drives his sled off a hill and into a rocky ditch. Cookie Monster even runs into a tree and crashes the sled into the tree but flies into the tree with his face. This Cookie Monster driving and crashing video is super funny!  This Sesame Street Cookie Monster crashing while sledding video is made by the \"Disney Car Toys\" channel. Maybe Cookie Monster is a bad driver because he's trying to sled with a cookie in his hand. Looks like Cookie Monster might need a sledding leason from Mario, just like he got a cozy coupe driving lesson from Mario on an earlier DisneyCarToys episode. Cookie Monster needs to give up driving and sledding and just stick to making snow angels.

JD has Cerebral Palsy (spastic diplegia). This footage was taken in 2008. 6 months prior to the filming of this video, JD had a selective dorsal rhizotomy to reduce spasticity. Post surgery his legs were profoundly weakened and he was undergoing rehabilitation and therapy under the expert care of his Mum and Dad and their team of health care professionals . As a result of the lack of muscular control, the hips were positioned in excessive internal rotation and the thighs were turned inwards. The legs come very close together with intermittent scissoring gait . His feet were constantly knocking each other when he walked. This posed a significant safety risk of falling and tripping and reducing his sense of independence. The Spiral Thigh Brace was used to promote pelvic stability , improve proprioception and to apply directional tension to bring the legs into a more neutral or externally rotated position, to reduce the frequency of the feet knocking together . In this video you can see that the legs are more separated with the brace insitu and the legs are moving in a more neutral fashion . He is able to swing the legs through more effectively and heel strike more effectively with decreased incidence of feet knocking each other. JD was one of the first clients I trialled the Spiral Thigh Brace on. I am forever grateful for the patience and generosity of spirit  that JD and his family displayed in allowing me to trial and modify garments with their helpful feedback. Thank you JD :)", "title": "Spiral Thigh Brace for Cerebral Palsy  (spastic diplegia)", "publishedDate": "2012-09-05T23:17:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "0QXj3_wwD54", "description": "Here we go on the ROAD TO RONALDO.

It may refer to only the mansion (the 340-room main building) that has the President's official residence and offices; it may also refer to the entire 130 hectare (320 acre) President Estate that includes huge gardens (Mughal Gardens), residences of bodyguards and staff, other offices, stables and open spaces. The Rashtrapati Bhavan is a large and vast mansion with four floors and has 340 rooms. It is built on a floor area of 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2). It faces east. A straight east-west road, Rajpath (called King's Way or Kingsway by the British), starts from the huge square, Vijay Chowk, in front of Rashtrapati Bhavan and ends at India Gate on the western end of the road. North Avenue and South Avenue are two approach roads north and south of the estate in perfect symmetry. The east-west road (Rajpath) out of the Rashtrapati Bhawan is flanked by the two huge Central Secretariat buildings (North and South Blocks) that house various ministries of the Government of India. The Parliament House is located at eastern end of North Block.\n\nThe plan of the building is designed around a massive square with multiple courtyards and open inner areas within. The plan called for two wings; one for the Viceroy and residents and another for guests. The residence wing is a separate four-storey house in itself, with its own court areas within. This wing was so large that the first Indian governor-general, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, opted to live the smaller guest wing, a tradition that has since been followed by subsequent presidents. The original residence wing is now used primarily for state receptions and as a guest wing for visiting heads of state.\n\nThe centre of the main wing of the building, underneath the main dome, is the Durbar Hall, which was known as the Throne Room during British rule when it had thrones for the Viceroy and Vicereine (his wife). The interior of this room and almost all the rooms of the palace are bare, relying on stonework and shapes to show austerity rather than intricate decoration. In the hall, the columns are made in Delhi order which combines vertical lines with the motif of a bell. The vertical lines from the column were also used in the frieze around the room, which could not have been done with one of the traditional Greek orders of columns. The hall has a 2-ton chandelier which hangs from a 33-metre height. The two state drawing rooms, the state supper room and the state library are each on the four corners of the hall. \n\nThere are also other rooms such as many loggias (galleries with open air on one side) which face out into the courtyards, a large dining hall with an extremely long table, sitting rooms, billiards rooms, and a large ball room, and staircases. Water features are also through the palace, such as near the Viceroy's stairs, which has eight marble lion statues spilling water into six basins. These lions were symbolic of the heraldry of Great Britain. There is also an open area in one room to the sky, which lets in much of the natural light.\n \nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

What might seem like a busman's holiday was actually far from it... \n\nHunters Yard offers \"The authentic 1930's broads sailing experience\" and I can confirm it was exactly that! With no engine or electrics, the traditional gaff rig and quant pole was all we had to propel us through the water. With winds blowing between 5 and 25 kts, gusting and veering, it took all our concentration to safely navigate the twisting and winding rivers of the Broads. \n\nInitially we headed into Potter Heigham, a truly amazing and unique village with ramshackle houses and sheds lining the river bank. Accessed only by boat, craft of all shapes and sizes could be seen; from modern speed boats, canoes, sailing dinghies, narrow boats and even the renowned Wherry all jostled for position in a strangely contrasting yet harmonious manner.\n\nFrom there we headed south west along the Bure to Ranworth. The Malthouse Broad provided a welcome bit of space to spread our wings and sail with some much needed freedom. As we moored up on the lee shore our thoughts were more focussed on beer and food than an exit strategy for the next day. Despite knowing that the forecast was for the wind to increase and stay in the North I hoped that somehow things would be better in the morning... \n\nSadly it was not to be! For any onlooker I imagine that the graceful old gaffer would have looked a picture of serenity. Little would they know of the internal discord as three seasoned ocean sailors tacked furiously against the wind and tide all the way out of the narrow cut and back onto the Bure. With two very young children in tow it was at times more challenging than any sailing I have ever experienced. Hats off to all the sailors of the Broads, tacking to windward in an extremely narrow river onboard a heavy old gaff rigged yacht is far from easy. Progress can be extremely slow and the banks can be uncomfortably close. Quanting in itself is a very respectable skill and it seemed more luck than judgement that we didn't have a man over board to add to our excitement. \n\nA glorious couple of days all thanks to the lovely people at http://www.huntersyard.co.uk/  Long may they continue providing us all with such wonderful working pieces of history. A joy to see and a real treat to sail! \n\nThe excellent music is by The Broad Cut Drifters and was recorded at Clippesby Hall     \n\nHalcyon Yachts Ltd is a dedicated international yacht delivery specialist with highly experienced and qualified crew.

It is the most commonly installed exterior cladding for residential construction in the United States and Canada.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R5HDldr3bs\n\nhome inspection dayton ohio\ntony burk  \naccutech home inspections\nhome inspectors dayton ohio\ndayton home inspectors\nhome inspection dayton oh\nhome inspections dayton\nhome inspector dayton\nhome inspector dayton oh\nhome inspection dayton\ndayton oh home inspection", "title": "The Home Inspectors in Dayton Show BBQ Grills and Vinyl Siding | (937) 490-9154 | CALL US!", "publishedDate": "2013-04-04T14:58:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "0R5fdSeBWn8", "description": "Roendo a carca\u00e7a de um macaco Bugio (Alouatta guariba)", "title": "Gamb\u00e1 (Didelphis aurita)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-15T22:34:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "0R6BDl4YioQ", "description": "", "title": "Chica con canna - This iz how it ends up!", "publishedDate": "2011-12-16T16:18:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "0R6ayr5B2hE", "description": "Excuse my camera shy. /.\\\nAnyhow, this is my first actual video and I just wanted to introduce myself along with tell you guys and gals what I'm planning on turning this page into. \nSupport or not, HipKit's rock! :3", "title": "Channel Upbringing", "publishedDate": "2014-08-08T01:40:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "0R7Wm2IDi7k", "description": "Local TV-station \u00c5land24, news, weather, politics, sport and events since 2007\nwww.aland24.ax\n\n\u00c5land24\nAlbin Dahlin\nLisa Bergkvist\nMannechai Thai restaurant\nJohnny Ahlstr\u00f6m\nR\u00f6ster f\u00f6r \u00d6stersj\u00f6n\nTarja Halonen\nRoger Nordlund\nRakt P\u00e5\nNina Fellman\nCarolina Sandell\nSirkka Wegelius\nFredrik Karlstr\u00f6m\nDaniel Dahl\u00e9n\nVindkraftverk\n\u00c5lands Vindandelslag\nB\u00e5tsk\u00e4ren\nChampagne\nauction\nJohn Kapon\nAcker Merral & Condit\nFran\u00e7ois Hautekeur\nlive \nworldrecord in champagne \u00c5land24\nAlbin Dahlin\nLisa Bergkvist\nMannechai Thai restaurant\nJohnny Ahlstr\u00f6m\nR\u00f6ster f\u00f6r \u00d6stersj\u00f6n\nTarja Halonen\nRoger Nordlund\nRakt P\u00e5\nNina Fellman\nCarolina Sandell\nSirkka Wegelius\nFredrik Karlstr\u00f6m\nDaniel Dahl\u00e9n\nVindkraftverk\n\u00c5lands Vindandelslag\nB\u00e5tsk\u00e4ren\nChampagneauktion\nJohn Kapon\nAcker Merral & Condit\nFran\u00e7ois Hautekeur\nlive\nBottle of champagne sells for world record $43,630\nVeuve Cliqout\nBengt Frithiofsson\nDax\nDanne Sundman \nBabysim\nMikaelas babysim\nViking Line \nAmorella\nRasmus Olin\nG\u00e4dda\nViktor Eriksson\nSilversk\u00e4r\nTrygve Eriksson\nHoffmaestro & Chra\nJohan Orre\nWilliam Johansson\nM/S Newbuilding\nSTX Finland\n\u00c5bo\nBulb\nSportmagasinet\n\u00c5land United\nNiclas Nordlund\nSkidskytte\nHJK\nJari Litmanen\nVeikkausliiga\nPresskonferens\nSkarven\nVeronica Th\u00f6rnroos\nPekka Haavisto\nPub Bastun\nOrup\nValdebatt\nHemv\u00e5rdsst\u00f6d\nViveka Eriksson\nCamilla Gunell\nJohan Ehn\nGun-Mari Lindholm\nAnders Eriksson\nHarry Jansson\n\n\n\nAhvenanmaa\nThe Aland islands", "title": "\u00c5land24 trailer", "publishedDate": "2012-02-16T13:22:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "0R7oMzT86Vk", "description": "Si toi aussi tu veux pr\u00e9senter ta transmogrification sur notre cha\u00eene contacte nous via notre site internet http://www.worldofwarcraft-duckbutter... , page contact. \nJ'aurais alors juste besoin du d\u00e9tail des noms de tes pi\u00e8ces de stuff et de filmer ton personnage quelques minutes \u00ab \u00e0 poil \u00bb puis avec les pi\u00e8ces de la transmo \u00e9quip\u00e9es.

So when they immigrate to America, there have reportedly been some cases there some men simply list 'wives' number 2, 3 and 4 as 'extended family' to qualify for welfare and a myriad of other tax-payer-funded government programs!\n  \nSo if you live in Michigan and you feel you entitled to have 4 wives, there may be no  need to assimilate into American culture or to to get a job. You simply call the Public Assistance office  to get a recording directing you to press 1 for English, 2 for Spanish or 3 for Arabic.\n\nDon't believe me?\n\nCall for this number for yourself and press 3 for Arabic.\n1-888-678-8914  (Michigan EBT Card hotline) \n\nWhere is the public outcry?

This is on her 1980 album \"Marigold\" which includes 2 other songs about this golden flower.  It is from the Taiwanese film \"The Marigolds\" (March 29, 1980) which starred Han Chin, Brigitte Lin, and Ma Yonglin, and was directed by Liu Lili. You can see posters from the film in this video, as well as Cicely Mary Barker's Marigold Fairy.  1980 was also the year of Fei Fei's marriage to Hong Kong businessman Zhao Hongqi (\u8d99\u5b8f\u7426), who died of lung cancer in 2009 at the age of 70. \n\nAs with Teresa Teng, the more I investigate Fong Fei Fei's music, the more I am enchanted. My stay in Taiwan will be longer than expected, though Shanghai remains in my heart. Apart from her lovely voice, Fong Fei Fei  was famous for the hats she wore, she owned more than 600 hats in her lifetime. She was born Lin Qiu Luan on August 20th, 1953 in  Dasi Township, Taoyuan County, Taiwan. She started her career by acting and hosting a Taiwanese television series back in 1971. Her first single was released the same year, and her incomparable voice soon brought her to fame in the Asian music industry. She was further propelled to superstardom in the late 1970s when she started singing movie theme songs for the adaptations of romance novels by Chiung Yao.\nFong Fei Fei  spent the last ten years of her life in Hong Kong. She recorded 81 albums in all, and continued performing even as her health deteriorated. She cancelled a concert in June 2011 after finding something wrong with her vocal cords. She was diagnosed with lung cancer. She apologized to her fans, and said that the doctors had recommended she rest for a year to recuperate.\n\nOn January 3, 2012, Fong Fei Fei died at the age of 58, but the news was only reported on February 13, 2012, by her attorney per her request to keep her illness and death out of the press until all of her funeral arrangements were settled. She had wanted to keep everything low-key. Her web site said that Fong had insisted on personally signing birthday and New Year cards for fans, even during the last month of her life. She thanked her fans for supporting her throughout her career. \"\"I have lived a happy and wonderful life,\" she said. \"Thank you for being by my side all this time, my brothers and sisters.

But I doubt whether he can have this without economic independence, which the new society is abolishing. For economic independence allows an education not controlled by Government; and in adult life it is the man who needs, and asks, nothing of Government who can criticise its acts and snap his fingers at its ideology. Read Montaigne; that's the voice of a man with his legs under his own table, eating the mutton and turnips raised on his own land. Who will talk like that when the State is everyone's schoolmaster and employer? Admittedly, when man was untamed, such liberty belonged only to the few. I know. Hence the horrible suspicion that our only choice is between societies with few freemen and societies with none. \n\nAgain, the new oligarchy (1) must more and more base its claim to plan us on its claim to knowledge. If we are to be mothered, mother must know best. This means they must increasingly rely on the advice of scientists, till in the end the politicians proper become merely the scientists' puppets. Technocracy is the form to which a planned society must tend. Now I dread specialists in power because they are specialists speaking outside their special subjects. Let scientists tell us about sciences. But government involves questions about the good for man, and justice, and what things are worth having at what price; and on these a scientific training gives a man's opinion no added value. Let the doctor tell me I shall die unless I do so-and-so; but whether life is worth having on those terms is no more a question for him than for any other man. \n\n\n(1) it seems childish not to recognize that actual government is and always must be oligarchical.

It is one of the most commonly seen wild animals of central and northern India, often seen in farmland or scrub forest. The mature male appears ox-like and is also known as the blue bull. A blue bull is called a nil gai or nilgai in India, from nil meaning blue and gai meaning a bovine animal (literally 'cow'). It is also present in parts of southern Nepal and eastern Pakistan. The species has become extinct in Bangladesh. It was known as the nilghor (nil = blue, ghor = horse) during the rule of Aurangzeb in the Mughal era. It is the only member of genus Boselaphus.\n\nNilgai antelope are found throughout most of India, from the base of the Himalayas in the north, down to the state of Karnataka in the south, being absent only in eastern Bengal, Assam, the Malabar Coast, and regions close to the Bay of Bengal. They inhabit the Gir forest and across Rajasthan in the west to the states of Assam and West Bengal in the east. In Nepal, they occur patchily in the southern lowlands. Historic notes mention the nilgai in southern parts of India, but these may be a feral population:\n\nNilgai are habitat generalists, living in grasslands and woodlands where they eat grasses, leaves, buds, and fruit. They avoid dense forest and prefer the plains and low hills with shrubs, but may also be found in cultivated areas.\n\nNilgai are usually found in their favoured areas of scrub jungle (acacia forests) grazing upon succulent kader grass. They are not averse to crossing marshlands.\n\nNilgai are diurnal, and tend to form single-sex herds outside of the breeding season. Herds are not of fixed composition, with individuals joining and rejoining through the year. Female herds typically contain three to six adults, together with their calves, whereas bulls form herds of two to 18 individuals. In winter, male nilgai form herds of 30 to 100 animals in northern India.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilgai\n\nThis video taken from Alipore Zoo at the time of visiting myself in April, 2014.

The toddler startled grieving relatives only hours after doctors were unable to resuscitate him during treatment for pneumonia.\n\n He apparently smiled, looked round, drank his water then reclined back in his coffin. Dad Antonio Santos could not wake Kelvin again and carried him to hospital in Belem, northern Brazil. But doctors were mystified as to what happened and confirmed he was indeed dead. \n\nMr Santos said: \"During the wake I held Kelvin and said, son, come back to daddy'. \"And a few hours later my son sat up in the coffin and said, daddy, give me water'. \"Everybody started to scream. We thought a miracle had taken place and our boy had come back to life. \"Then he lay down again and didn't move again\n\n. We couldn't wake him.\" Kelvin died from pneumonia and respiratory failure in Aberlardo Santos Hospital at 7pm on Friday following a five-day fever. His family held a wake throughout the night at home and at 3pm the following day, an hour before the funeral, mourners said the toddler came to life.

Freitag, Jonathan Glickman, Wayne Morris, Arthur M. Sarkissian, Art Schaeffer, Jay Stern\nScreenwriter: Ross LaManna, Jim Kouf\nFilm Description: Brett Ratner directed this action-comedy that found box-office success by teaming Chris Tucker with Jackie Chan -- performing his own stunts as per his earlier films. As the story begins, Hong-Kong supercop Lee's (Chan), detective savvy leads to the confiscation of $500 million in weapons, drugs, and Chinese art. When Hong Kong Chinese Consul Han (Tzi Ma), is sent on a diplomatic mission to Los Angeles, his 11-year-old daughter, Soo Young (Julia Hsu), is abducted by an international criminal mastermind. The FBI assures Han they will find the kidnappers and return her safely, yet Han only trusts his longtime friend and ally (also his daughter's beloved martial arts teacher) Inspector Lee, who immediately flies in to help. Unwilling to have an outsider interfere in their investigation, the FBI assigns rogue LAPD detective (and buffoon) James Carter (Chris Tucker) to the case. Hoping to impress the FBI, Carter enthusiastically reports for work but is dismayed to discover his real mission is only to keep Lee away from the case (read b-a-b-y-s-i-t-t-e-r). The arrogant Carter reacts by embarking on a one-man crusade to solve the case, but he must first distract Lee. It doesn't take Carter long before he realizes he has greatly underestimated his Hong Kong counterpart, who sees what's going on and slips away. Impatient FBI agents try to cast off these unwanted misfit cops, but with an assist from LAPD bomb expert Tania Johnson (Elizabeth Pena), Carter and Lee eventually confront the bad guys in a full-tilt action sequence.\n\n\"rush hour\",\"rush hour clip\",\"rush hour 3\",\"rush hour 3 part 1\",\"jackie chan\",\"chris tucker\",\"brett ratner\",\"bag videos\",\"car videos\",\"luggage videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"action adventure\",\"action comedies\",blockbusters,\"crime action\",\"crime thrillers\",\"martial arts\",\"roger birnbaum\",\"james m freitag\",\"art schaeffer\",\"jonathan glickman\",\"jay stern\",\"arthur m sarkissian\",\"leon dudevoir\",\"wayne morris\",\"communication videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++173501,/m/012d40,/m/01900g", "title": "Do You Understand the Words That Are Coming Out of My Mouth? - Rush Hour (1/5) Movie CLIP (1998) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T03:28:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "0RlslK4nB7o", "description": "The fishies feast on a nasty bristle worm.

Nevertheless, because of the Moorish occupation of the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages, and the participation of Portugal in the Age of Discovery, it has adopted loanwords from all over the world.\nVery few Portuguese words can be traced to the pre-Roman inhabitants of Portugal, which included the Gallaeci, Lusitanians, Celtici and Cynetes. The Phoenicians and Carthaginians, briefly present, also left some scarce traces. Some notable examples are ab\u00f3bora \"pumpkin\" and bezerro \"year-old calf\", from the nearby Celtiberian language (probably through the Celtici); cerveja \"beer\", from Celtic; through Latin \"cervisia.\"\nIn the 5th century, the Iberian Peninsula (the Roman Hispania) was conquered by the Germanic Suebi and Visigoths. As they adopted the Roman civilization and language, however, these people contributed only a few words to the lexicon, mostly related to warfare\u2014such as espora \"spur\", estaca \"stake\", and guerra \"war\", from Gothic *spa\u00fara, *stakka, and *wirro, respectively. The influence also exists in toponymic surnames and patronymic surnames borne by Visigoth sovereigns and their descendants, and it dwells on placenames such has Ermesinde, Esposende and Resende where sinde and sende are derived from the Germanic \"sinths\" (military expedition) and in the case of Resende, the prefix re comes from Germanic \"reths\" (council).\nBetween the 9th and 13th centuries, Portuguese acquired about 900 words from Arabic by influence of Moorish Iberia. They are often recognizable by the initial Arabic article a(l)-, and include many common words such as aldeia \"village\" from \u0627\u0644\u0636\u064a\u0639\u0629 al\u1e0dai`a (or from Edictum Rothari: aldii, aldias),[80] alface \"lettuce\" from \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0633 alkhass, armaz\u00e9m \"warehouse\" from \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u0632\u0646 almakhzan, and azeite \"olive oil\" from \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a azzait. From Arabic came also the grammatically peculiar word oxal\u00e1 \u0625\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \"hopefully\". The Mozambican currency name metical was derived from the word \u0645\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644 mitq\u0101l, a unit of weight. The word Mozambique itself is from the Arabic name of sultan Mu\u00e7a Alebique (Musa Alibiki).\nStarting in the 15th century, the Portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from Asian languages. For instance, catana \"cutlass\" from Japanese katana and ch\u00e1 \"tea\" from Chinese ch\u00e1.\nFrom South America came batata \"potato\", from Taino; anan\u00e1s and abacaxi, from Tupi--Guarani nan\u00e1 and Tupi ib\u00e1 cati, respectively (two species of pineapple), and tucano \"toucan\" from Guarani tucan.\n\nPortuguese language schools\nPortuguese language software\nPortuguese language training\nPortuguese lesson\nPortuguese lessons\nPortuguese names\nPortuguese online\nPortuguese phrases\nPortuguese school\nPortuguese software\nPortuguese translate\nPortuguese translation\nPortuguese translations\nPortuguese translator\nPortuguese tutor\nPortuguese vocabulary\nPortuguese words\nPortuguese writing\nlearn basic Portuguese\nlearn how to speak Portuguese\nlearn Portuguese\nstudy Portuguese\nstudy Portuguese language\nteach me Portuguese", "title": "Learn how to speak Portuguese fluently and easily", "publishedDate": "2013-12-14T11:54:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "0RmSTVlhjKo", "description": "African Naturals at 4511 S Kingshighway Blvd, St Louis, MO 63109.
