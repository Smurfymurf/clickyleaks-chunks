This article will deal specifically with how to develop explosive speed in punching. The principle behind this type of training is to recruit all the muscles involved in punching in the quickest amount of time. How does this differ from traditional strength building techniques? Traditional body building techniques often employ slow movements to ensure proper form and maximum contraction at the peak of any given movement. While these movements are great for building strength and sculpting muscle, it doesn't specifically target 'explosive' speed and power.\n\nWhat this bag workout is designed to do is to add a 'ploymetric' dimension to your training. What is 'Ploymetric Training?' Ploymetric exercises recruit a large number of quick twitch muscle fibers in an extremely short period of time. When performing explosive movements, such as clapping hand push ups, pop squats, clean and presses, you are recruiting fast twitch muscles which build strength and SPEED. Another example is the marathon runner vs. the 100 yard dash sprinter. Although the marathon runner would most likely have superior endurance in a long distance run, it is unlikely that a long distance runner could ever match the time of a sprinter in a 100 yard dash. Why is this? Don't they both run as their primary mode of exercise? yes and No. The sprinter trains for explosiveness, while the marathon runner develops endurance over long distance. Notice the difference in muscularity with a marathon runner and a sprinter? It's because their training focuses on different types of muscle FIBERS. The Sprinter focuses on the fast twitch explosive muscles. That being said, let's turn to how we can develop fast twitch muscles specifically for punching:\n\nThe 1st round of this workout is a warm up round to loosen up the muscles for the work out ahead. Simply through some basic combinations on the bag for three minutes. Any of the basic combos will do.\n-jab\n-double jab\n-jab cross\n-jab cross hook\n-hook cross hook\n-jab hook cross\n\nThe 2nd round will emphasis more POWER in your punches. Throw single power shots at the bag while trying to maintain good balance and form. You can throw combinations if you like but try and keep it to a max of two punches per combo with the emphasis on POWER. Again for three minute\n\nRound 3 is where the fun begins: for three minutes you will be doing explosive straight punch flurries at the bag. Don't worry, I do not mean three minutes straight-you will throw straight punches in succession as quickly as you can for 10 seconds, and then REST for 10 seconds. Then throw the punches again for 10 seconds, and then rest for 10 seconds-ect. until the 3 minutes has elapsed.\n\nRest 1 minute\n\nRound 4- You will do the same pattern as round three except this time you will use left and right HOOKS. 10 sec blast of hooks followed by 10 sec of rest. Repeat for 3 minutes\n\nRest 1 minute\n\nRound 5-Here we are at the finish line! Do the same pattern as round three and four except now you will use UPPERCUTS. 10 sec blast of upper cuts followed by 10 sec of rest. Repeat for 3 minutes\n\nDo this routine twice a week in your work out routines. It is not long but it is killer on the cardio and your explosive spped will increase dramatically within as little as two weeks. Thanks for reading and let me know about your results!\n\nTHINK FIT!

The Flipcore construction turns the core material upside down for a natural rocker shape and flex pattern, as well as a boost in stability.\nThe powder specific rocker shape lifts and tapers in the tip and tail for effortless float, and is flat underfoot for a loose surfy feel. To even further improve performance in the powder, Blizzard used a carbon construction in the tips and tails for lower swing weight and more ability to surf and smear in the soft stuff.\nBut perhaps the most impressive thing about the Spur is how stable it feels at speed after the good stuff has been tracked out\u2014 a result of the carbon tips and Flipcore tech working together.\nThe Spur is 146 mm in the tips, a fat 125 underfoot, and 134 in the tails. It has a poplar bamboo core with Iso Wood stringers and a carbon layup in the tips and tails.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a powder specific ski that can surf and carve but won\u2019t get thrown around when you\u2019re straight lining it back to the lift, the Blizzard Spur is just the thing you\u2019ve been looking for.", "title": "2015 BLIZZARD SPUR", "publishedDate": "2014-08-13T16:20:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "7cet6z3qJN0", "description": "http://www.islamandafrica.com\n\nWhat is the big deal over a womans head dress? The hijab identifies women as followers of Islam, with it also comes tremendous responsibility. The hijab is not merely a covering dress, but more importantly, it is behavior, manners, speech and appearance in public. The headscarf is an outer manifestation of an inner commitment to worshipping. It symbolizes a commitment to piety and is a form of spirtual beauty. It is also a symbol of human cultural diversity.\nEuropeans through the lens of cultural supremacy and sheer arrogance assume that the values of Europeans should be the values of the world. And unless the rest of the world is struggling to be more like them, the world is backward and oppressed.\nThis is the continuation of the tradition in orientalist thinking which misunderstood everything in African culture it saw. It is ironic that the issue of \"liberation\" in the West is anchored almost exclusively to sex: Freedom is an expression of excessiveness and amorality.\n\nAnd while they would say \"choice\" when it comes to Western societies, the word is \"coerced, and brainwashed\" for Islamic communities. However, the majority of Hollywood actresses and singers always end up 1/2 naked in FHM and the like to appease the sexualization and commodification of Western markets. Yet this is not labelled as a form of denigration and oppression. There is a serious social expectation in Western societies to sexualize women, from Rihanna to Beyonce, all of them express themselves with degrees of nudity.\n\nSo what is the real issue the West has with the Hijab? The Hijab is a cultural political symbol of the face of the rise of Islam. Every year more of the West sees women wearing this \"alien\" dress on their high streets. It is a political sign of a world they have always been at odds with. But now the Muslim is again in Europe, but not with weapons of war, but weapons of culture. Now in the UK we see White skinned British girls walking down Oxford street in hijab. A serious threat to the \"Europeanization\" which is being diminished in the face of multiculturalism.", "title": "Hijab the politics Of the Muslim Veil (Our Story Our Voice) 2007", "publishedDate": "2012-02-24T17:51:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "7cf7tp9dnpc", "description": "http://www.jetwashseal.co.uk Wolverhampton Window Cleaner | Window Washing Wolverhampton | Window Cleaning Wolverhampton | Glass Cleaning Wolverhampton | carries out window cleaning service also pressure cleaning and sealing service .Our window cleaning Service will leave your windows sparkling crystal clear with no streaks and includes cleaning your window frames and sills as part of the regular service.

Remember, there is a difference between the endowment ritual and the endowment itself. The ritual is not the endowment, but how the endowment is taught-in much the same way that the Catholic Mass is not Holy Communion but how Holy Communion is given to the congregation. \nThis video aims to and hits a bulls eye when it comes to showing that ritual and that becoming perfected has been and always SHOULD be found in the true, Christian church. (See Matthew 5:48/ Revelations 1:5-6, 3:19-21)\nPeople can look at this video all they want and deny it flatly to its face... but this information is real. Other similar mosaics also show temple worship much like the kind we do. NOTHING we do in the temple is unique or strange compared to what was practiced in the \"House of Israel.\" We still anoint and wash ourselves in preparation to enter the Lord's house to receive additional instruction. (See Exodus 29)\n\nThis resembles, in part, the temple endowment. I personally have gone through the temple for myself and countless times for others; (ie, temple work for proxy for and in behalf of others) and to me, this resembles what we do in the temple. It's not weird or cult-ish but a restored practice lost from long ago.\n\nFor more information on the message of Jesus Christ and the restoration of his church, visit  http://www.lds.org", "title": "Joseph Smith And The Masons (Part 1)", "publishedDate": "2010-02-08T18:46:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "7cfeGrEuBTE", "description": "Ryan Heaton's proposal for presenting OSCON 2014.", "title": "OSCON 2014 Proposal: Ryan Heaton: The warm aroma of a hypermedia-enabled client", "publishedDate": "2014-01-30T22:24:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "7cfmHJQJVds", "description": "You might think that for me to call the Judeo Christian god evil and imaginary at the same time would be a contradiction, but it's really not.\n\nIn this video I'm going illustrate very clearly how your god IS in fact both evil & non-existent.", "title": "The Evil & Imaginary God of Abraham", "publishedDate": "2011-11-14T22:03:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "7cfqLrzb5Ug", "description": "The affluent Mediterranean island of Malta is facing a new challenge. \n\nIt is running out of fresh water.

Though he had not got any financial aid or assistance from anybody but the organisation is decorated with thousand and thousands of scientific models, a garden of five acres, a laboratory measuring 150'-0\"x15'-0\" , sophisticated Audiovisual systems, workshop to materialise the thoughts of the children etc. He had a jeep which is used to transport his models to different rural  areas for displaying of  \"simple innovation \" programmefor which he do not accept any fees. Different kinds of new models are built in the workshop by the students under the strong supervision of the resource person of SROSTI. Of course, this laboratory is a living wonder in the realm of science. \nThat, Mihir panda had constantly been rendering service since 1987 to popularize science and mathematics among the millions of students ,teachers and common people through programme \"simple innovation\". He had manufacturing low cost models from the waste and unused materials  & instrumental in changing and enriching the lives of the rest in the society by inculcating a sense of positive attitude in their mind towards science. Being fired by the zeal of dedication and determination Mihir panda had been devoting most of my time and energy for making science easily, accessibly to anybody and everybody. The students who were immensely preoccupied with fear psychosis especially for science and mathematics have tremendously changed their attitude and developed an appetite for learning science and mathematics in a jocund manner.  The simple innovation of Mihir panda had helped the farmers, phycally challanged persons,house wives and for any body.His  hundreds of innovations are  counted for people science.\nAlthough in recognition to his research he had been awarded by different organizations, but it is a matter of regret that, he had not received any financial assistance from any Govt./Non Govt. organization, as a matter of fact he had been passing through a precarious financial position and pressing hard to materialize his noble dream by Playing cheerfully with science and mathematics. \nIn his Laboratory there are more than Thirty Thousand model designs to demonstrate the different experiments of science through Audio-visual class, play way methods to learn science and mathematics, observing natural Bonsai and many more...  for the teachers and students as well   without any fee.", "title": "magic peble and our nerves system", "publishedDate": "2011-05-08T06:22:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "7cqerkrMWbc", "description": "This video was made for a contest held by G4.

This filleting video is also relevant for your smaller Mackerel Species, in Australia on the Great Barrier Reef we get school, spotty, Grey, and shark mackerel just to name a few.\nThis footage was taken on a recent three day fishing charter on Mako, a Steber 41, and did we catch some fish.  We caught 8 spanish Mackerel in 45 minutes and left them biting as we were on our way to the Great Barrier Reef.   Find a school of Spanish Mackerel and can be unreal fishing action, with numerous double hookups and even losing one to the sharks.  \nSpanish Mackerel can be caught on all our charters from day trips, liveaboard fishing charters and our famous Reefari Hardline, Mothershipping with Raptor II to the remotest regions of the Great Barrier Reef for some awesome fishing adventure.\nPlease subscribe for more great fishing and boating tips, with heaps to come.\nCheers Greg\n\nSpanish mackerel can be caught by a variety of methods so pays to try different things as can be fussy at times and shut down.  check out our webpage for more great info on Spanish Mackerel, or come on one of our fishing charters to get amongst the action.\nhttp://www.reefari.com/fishingmackay/spanishmackerel.html", "title": "How to fillet a spanish(King) mackerel", "publishedDate": "2010-07-17T21:44:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "7d7B7n1Nrso", "description": "First video from Team Moe's performance at Taiyoucon 2011.  \n\nAs always we danced Shijin MEIDO ha mune mune kyun ki? from Kanzen Maid Sengen from @home cafe.

It was bred as early as the 16th century near the city of Ghent, Belgium. It is believed to have descended from a number of meat and fur breeds, possibly including the Steenkonijn (Stone Rabbit -- referring to the old Belgian weight size of one stone or about 3.76 kg (8 lb 5 oz)) and the European \"Patagonian\" breed (now extinct). This \"Patagonian\" rabbit, a large breed that was once bred in Belgium and France, was not related to the Patagonian rabbit of Argentina (Sylvilagus brasiliensis), a separate wild species weighing less than two pounds (about 1 kg), nor the Patagonian hare (Dolichotis patagonum), a species in the cavy family of rodents that cannot interbreed with rabbits. Thomas Coatoam, in his Origins of the Flemish Giants, tells us, \"The earliest authentic record of the Flemish Giant Rabbit occurred about the year 1860.\"\n \n A sandy Flemish male napping next to a sable and white sheltie.\n\nThe first standards for the breed were written in 1893. The Flemish Giant is an ancestor of many rabbit breeds all over the world, one of which is the Belgian Hare, imported into England in the mid 19th century. The Flemish Giant was exported from England and Belgium to America in the early 1890s to help improve the size of meat rabbits during the great \"rabbit boom\".\n\nIt received little attention until about 1910 where it started appearing at small livestock shows throughout the country. Today, it is one of the more popular breeds at rabbit shows because of its unusually large size and its varying colors. It is promoted by the National Federation of Flemish Giant Rabbit Breeders, which was formed in 1915. The Flemish Giant has many nicknames, first and foremost the \"Gentle Giant\" for its uniquely docile personality and also the \"universal rabbit\" for its varied purposes as pet, show, breeding, meat and fur animal.\n\nAs one of the largest breeds of domestic rabbit, the Flemish Giant is a semi-arch type rabbit with its back arch starting back of the shoulders and carrying through to the base of the tail giving a \"mandolin\" shape. The body of a Flemish Giant Rabbit is long and powerful with relatively broad hindquarters. Bucks have a broad, massive head in comparison to does. Does may have a large, full, evenly carried dewlap (the fold of skin under their chins). The fur of the Flemish Giant is known to be glossy and dense. When stroked from the hindquarters to the head, the fur will roll back to its original position. ARBA standard has seven different colors, black, blue, fawn, light gray, sandy, steel gray and white. They are shown in six classes (three buck classes and three doe classes): Junior bucks and does under 6 months, Intermediate bucks and does 6--8 months, and Senior bucks and does 8+ months. The minimum show weight for a Senior (older than 8 months) doe is 14 lbs (about 6.4 kg), and the minimum weight of a Senior buck is 13 lbs (about 5.9 kg) (ARBA Standards of Perfection). A senior doe can take 1 year to reach full maturity. A senior buck can take 1.5 years to reach full maturity. It is not unusual to see a 10 kilo (22 pound) Flemish Giant, with the largest weighing as much as 50 pounds; although these species technically constitute Continental and German Giants.\n\nSource abut Flemish Giant rabbits: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_Giant", "title": "Flemish Giant Bunny Rabbit Eating Strawberry", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T19:55:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "7dN21jCNCho", "description": "Time to clean out that closet!

When you are going through your closet and picking which items to donate, it always helps to have a friend help you edit. Send your fashion helper photos! They can give a \"thumbs up\" or \"down\" when you're not sure if its something you should donate or keep. \n\nUSE REUSABLE STORAGE BAGS: Pack your clothes in recyclable reusable bags when you are taking them to the store. Save plastic and paper!\n\nSHOP CONSCIOUSLY: Shopping vintage or secondhand is the most eco-friendly. But when you do buy clothes new, you can choose to buy clothes made from sustainable materials. Such as organic cotton. Tencel. And recycled polyester.\n\n\nMusic by Late Night Alumni \"The World Spins 'Round\"\nFrom their new album \"The Beat Becomes a Sound\"\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/album/the-beat-becomes-a-sound/id594338571\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/LNAmusic\nhttp://www.facebook.com/lnaofficial\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/latenightalumni\n\n\nFollow, like, share and more:\n\u2665 Subscribe! http://bit.ly/MPsubscribe\n\u2665 My Twitter: http://twitter.com/MichellePhan\n\u2665 My Facebook: http://facebook.com/MichellePhanOfficial\n\u2665 My Instagram: http://instagram.com/MichellePhan\n\u2665 My Blog: http://michellephan.com\n\nH&M is a proud sponsor of this video.", "title": "How to Recycle Your Wardrobe", "publishedDate": "2013-03-11T15:17:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "7dNB9SE0p-E", "description": "Germany gyrocompass system navigat.gyrocompass system,after repair test gyro-www.gyrocompas.com", "title": "C.PLATH NAVIGAT GYRO COMPASS SYSTEM-www.gyrocompas.com", "publishedDate": "2012-12-27T11:37:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "7dNQQ94VH5E", "description": "The Red Kangaroo (Macropus rufus) at Qalqiliya Zoo, Qalqiliya, Palestine. 05.07.2012.\n \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0646\u063a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0641\u064a \u062d\u062f\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u062d\u064a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0642\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u060c \u0642\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u060c \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646 . 05/07/2012\n\u062a\u0635\u0648\u064a\u0631 \u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648 : \u062f. \u0646\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 (\u0646\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0646) \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0633\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0637\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u062e\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0641\u0627\u0648\u064a\n\nVideo by: Dr. Sc.

For example, Krause U.S. Pat. No. 3,112,728 discloses a Twin Screw Power Motor Boat and Transmission Control. As disclosed, an internal combustion engine, a reduction gear and a drive shaft incorporate a bevel gear assembly in mesh with a pair of spaced bevel gears secured on the ends of a respective input shaft journaled and projected into a pair of transmissions.\n\nA more recent U.S. Pat. No. 3,924,557 of Bloch discloses a propeller mechanism for boats, As disclosed, the device consists of two shafts attached to a gear mechanism which is enclosed in cowlings mounted opposite each other on the hull of a boat. Propellers are mounted on the shafts, in addition, supports are provided attached to the splash board which also support two rudders mounted behind the propellers. The gear mechanism is connected to a motor controller located inside of the boat.\n\nFinally a Multi-Propeller Drive System is disclosed in Belenger, U.S. Pat. No. 5,413,512. As disclosed the system includes a single input shaft for connection to an engine, a differential gear assembly for directing the driving force from the input shaft between a pair of output shafts and a pair of laterally spaced propellers driven by the output shafts of the differential gear assembly. The differential gear assembly operates in a manner wherein one output shaft if required is permitted to revolve at a different speed than the other output shaft. A pair of brake mechanisms acting on the output shafts of the differential gear assembly enables an operator to control the rotational speed of the respective propellers without modifying the engine speed or transmission setting\n\nIn essence, the present invention comprises or consists of a marine engine, an inboard, outboard or inboard with outboard drives and a pair of parallel laterally spaced propeller shafts, a pair of marine propellers with one'of the propellers fixed to each of the shafts are also provided for rotation in opposite directions by the marine engine. In the present invention each of the propellers includes a rotatable hub and four equally spaced outwardly extending concave blades. The hub includes a first or forward portion having the shape of a frustum of a cone with a decreasing radius from a forward edge thereof to the middle of the hub. The hub also includes a second or rear section continuous with the first frustum of a cone and having a shape of a frustum of a cone with an increasing radius from the middle of the hub to a rear edge thereof \nThe base and top of the cone are of equal sizes. In other words one cone is a mirror image of the other cone. In addition, each of the equally spaced blades have a complex concave arcuate shape wherein a leading side of one of the propeller blades face a leading edge of one of the blades of the other of the propeller blades and are spaced apart by a distance of less than 1/2 the length of one of the blades.\nSee more at:\nhttp://tonchev.net \nhttp://starton.biz \nhttp://b2b.bg \nhttp://tonchev.org \nhttp://greenclips.eu\n JOIN QUIZGROUP PARTNER PROGRAM: http://join.quizgroup.com/?ref=54026", "title": "A pair partially counter rotating water surface propellers driven by a single electric motor 1", "publishedDate": "2014-11-07T19:24:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "7dT1w6FP8Ho", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "Dream Club Indonesia (DCI) cruise to MEDAN - Lamborghini Aventador", "publishedDate": "2014-03-11T11:56:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "7dTFVAzTQWk", "description": "\u261e Did you enjoy this video?

It involves using an overall-type harness and a self-inflating balloon which carries an attached lift line. An MC-130E engages the line with its V-shaped yoke and the individual is reeled on board. Red flags on the lift line guide the pilot during daylight recoveries; lights on the lift line are used for night recoveries. Recovery kits were designed for one and two-man recoveries.\n\nThe Fulton system was used from 1965 to 1996 on several variants of the C-130 Hercules including the MC-130s and HC-130s. Despite the apparent high-risk related to the use of the system, only one fatal accident occurred in 17 years of use (in 1982). The increased availability of long-range helicopters such as MH-53 Pave Low, HH-60 Pave Hawk and MH-47 Chinook, all with in-flight refueling capability, caused this system to be used less often. In September 1996, the Air Force Special Operations Command ceased maintaining the capability to deploy this system.

Il est exclu du s\u00e9minaire de Tiflis pour propagande religieuse. Il rencontre L\u00e9nine en 1905 et devient dirigeant du Parti ouvrier social-d\u00e9mocrate de Russie sous le pseudonyme de Staline (\u00ab l'homme d'acier \u00bb). Il est plusieurs fois arr\u00eat\u00e9 et d\u00e9port\u00e9 en Sib\u00e9rie. En 1917, il est l'un des dirigeants du parti bolch\u00e9vique et occupe les postes  de r\u00e9dacteur \u00e0 La Pravda, journal du parti bolch\u00e9vique, puis de commissaire aux nationalit\u00e9s. En 1922, il devient secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du parti communiste, poste qui lui permet de contr\u00f4ler l'ensemble du parti.\n  En 1924, apr\u00e8s la mort de L\u00e9nine, il \u00e9limine tous ses rivaux : Trotski, Kamenev, Zinoviev et Boukharine, d'abord politiquement en les chassant de la direction du parti, puis physiquement en les faisant assassiner (Trotski) ou ex\u00e9cuter lors des \u00ab proc\u00e8s de Moscou \u00bb. A partir de 1929, il reste seul ma\u00eetre de l'URSS et lance une politique d'industrialisation (plans quinquennaux) et de collectivisation forc\u00e9e des terres qui provoque la mort de millions de paysans.\n  En 1939, il signe avec l'Allemagne nazie le Pacte germano-sovi\u00e9tique, qui lui permet d'annexer l'est de la Pologne et les pays baltes. Surpris par l'attaque hitl\u00e9rienne de juin 1941, il finit par incarner la r\u00e9sistance russe face \u00e0 l'envahisseur allemand. La victoire de l'URSS aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s des alli\u00e9s contre l'Allemagne nazie renforce son prestige international et il peut, apr\u00e8s 1945, imposer le r\u00e9gime communiste en Europe centrale et orientale.

Their sweetness and juiciness help satisfy our sweet tooth in a refreshing way, and also helps keep us hydrated. But most of us discard the rind after nomming on the red watermelon flesh. Don't throw it away! In this video, we teach you how to make a delicious dessert out of the rind. \n\nOur recipe is extremely simple, requiring very few ingredients. If you don't have the spices, you can use just the rind and some sugar. The crystallized sugar syrup give the soft rinds a very unique texture, making this an absolutely scrumptious treat! \n\nThis Candied Watermelon Rind can also be kept in the refrigerator for many months as the sugar acts as a preservative. So you can enjoy these for a very long time, way past summer! \n\nWe hope you give this yummilicious sweet dessert a try next time you bring home a watermelon :)\n\nView our other dessert recipes: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhqzOfB7PbAd6IVaz15WOBWjp1_JVVXF\n\nVisit our videos page for more recipes: http://www.youtube.com/user/foodsofbangladesh/videos\n\nSubscribe to us!: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=foodsofbangladesh\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BanglaFoods\n\nWe're on Pinterest!: http://pinterest.com/BanglaFoods/", "title": "Candied Watermelon Rind / \u09a4\u09b0\u09ae\u09c1\u099c\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09cb\u09b0\u09ac\u09cd\u09ac\u09be (Tormujer Morobba) [English Subtitles]", "publishedDate": "2013-08-22T00:44:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "7dccbNbLsWg", "description": "News segment for JMC Assessment", "title": "Jason's Weather", "publishedDate": "2008-06-16T15:07:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "7dcjEdpd-B0", "description": "DEEMARK SHAKTI PRASH is a Dietry Supplement beneficial for Erectile Dysfunction.

The wet glass creates a seal while you bleach, protecting it from washing off. Use cold water and a soft brush, and medium pressure. You don't want to scratch the plastic while scrubbing, and the bleach does most of the work for you. When I flip it over, the intention isn't to wash off all of the developer, because then the emulsion will wash off. I just want to smooth it out with very light pressure so there is an even coating across the negative, hoping to avoid \"waves\" on the scanned negative. Then I let it dry in front of a fan (emulsion side up), assuming that the faster it dries, the less chance of bubbling. FP-100C is even easier because the emulsion is much tougher and you can rub off all the developer goop without worrying about removing the emulsion.

(National Park Service photograph)\n\n From: .ypte.org.UK/environmental/quarrying-and-mineral-extraction/79Why do we quarry?For thousands of years man has used stone for building, whether it was for monuments, religious...\n\n Many great civic buildings and churches are built from limestone from a local quarry. (See uses of limestone).\n\n Glass is usually brittle and easily shattered, but toughened glass can be used for windows. While glass is transparent and so lets light into a building, buildings with lots of glass can be too hot in the summer.\n\n However, it is a very heavy material, making it impractical for tall buildings; it is also quite expensive. Limestone was most popular in the early 20th and late 19th centuries. Train stations, banks and other structures from that era are normally limestone. Limestone is used as a facade on some skyscrapers, but only in thin sheets rather than solid blocks. In North America, most limestone used in constructiones from Indiana.\n\n Portland cement is one of the most important products made from limestone. It is essential in many construction applications. The United States is not self-sufficient in cement and must import it from other countries to make up for shortfalls. Imports of clinker (the product from the first step in making cement) and finished cement accounted for about 23% of total U.S. cement sales in . In the years just prior to , Portland cement was in seriously short supply in the Nation. Competition from other countries, an inadequate ocean transport system, and underestimated cargo space requirements were among the causes.", "title": "extraction of limestone important to industry", "publishedDate": "2012-09-11T21:34:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "7dj6OBOq7nI", "description": "", "title": "Diaper 1", "publishedDate": "2013-07-22T19:58:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "7djAdK3HAuk", "description": "Support on iTunes: http://monster.cat/1v4HoR5\nSupport on Beatport: http://monster.cat/14e1DR8\nSupport on Bandcamp: http://monster.cat/1v53zGR\n---\nListen on SoundCloud: http://monster.cat/1yzPfnw\nListen on Spotify: http://monster.cat/1pRIiiA\n\nMake sure to share Hellberg's new track with your friends using the hashtag #IMNOTOVER\n\nHelp get \"I'm Not Over\" trending on HYPE MACHINE: http://monster.cat/1wt8qwQ\n\n\u25bc Follow Monstercat\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/Monstercat\nSpotify: http://monster.cat/1hGrCWk\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/Monstercat\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/Monstercat\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/monstercat\nVine: https://vine.co/monstercat\nSoundCloud: http://soundcloud.com/Monstercat\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+Monstercat\nPodcast: http://live.monstercat.com/\n\n\u25bc Follow Hellberg\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/HellbergMusic\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/HellbergMusic\nSoundcloud: http://soundcloud.com/hellbergmusic\nYouTube: http://youtube.com/TheOfficialHellberg\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/hellbergmusic\n\n\u25bc Follow Tash\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/tashmusicofficial\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TASHMUSIC_\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/tashmusicofficial\n\n\u25bc Want some new Merchandise?\nhttp://www.monstercat.com/store", "title": "[Progressive House] - Hellberg - I'm Not Over (feat.

This video is to show the shotgun builds and not my skill at shooting them (or lack there of).  When I am working on a firearm build I try to get as much info on them as possible.  I hope this video will give some ideas to those looking to legally build a NFA shotgun.  The majority of ammo fired was Remington field loads with some 00 Buck thrown in on each (I only had one box to shoot between the two).\n\nSide by Side SBS:\nThe double barrel shotgun is a Stoeger Uplander which from the factory sported 26\" barrels.  The barrels are now 11\" with a 19\" overall length.  The front was a strait cut.  It appears the top and bottom ribs are soldered the length of the barrel.  I still plan to cold blue the cut and might fill up the front gap between the barrels with black silicon or something else for looks.  Also for looks I may add a bead sight.\n\nThe majority of the stock was cut off with a table saw and the grip was held in a vice while I grinded the grip to how I wanted it.  I had to find a new bolt to hold the grip on and I had to use a dremmel to open up the new screw hole to recess the bolt head into the grip.  After that I stained and sealed the stock set.  I thought about plugging the hole but it isn't uncomfortable to me when firing it so it will stay as is for right now.\n\nPump Shotgun:\nThe other shotgun is a Remington 870 Express Magnum with a 12.5\" barrel and Hogue 12\" LOP stock set.  It is around 31\" OAL and sports a MESA side saddle loaded with some Winchester 00 Buck loads and S&B slugs.  I still plan on adding a bead sight and possibly a big dot night sight over the bead. \n\nMY target for this video was dirt.  I wasn't trying to show the accuracy potential of either.  Later on when I have the bead sights installed I will be hosting a new video showing how each pattern with various 00 Buck loads. \n\nHope you enjoy the video and find it helpful!", "title": "NFA Shotguns - 11\" Double Barrel Stoeger 12 GA, 12.5\" Rem 870", "publishedDate": "2011-07-11T05:43:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "7e_cc6_iFCA", "description": "\u27a4 How to get cloth easy: http://youtu.be/aktCONgcCns\n\u27a4 How to make rag: http://youtu.be/Qhskp1-aVjQ\n\n\u27a4 Thanks for watching!

It often doesn't have much to do with what's actually happening in our lives, but instead it's the feeling that results when you visualize the worst case scenarios.\n\nIf you're a chronic worrier, you may not even realize that you are using one of your greatest tools - your imagination, to create events, relationships, and situations that give you even more to worry about.\n\nThe good news though is that worry is EASY to overcome, and believe it or not I'm going to prove it to you by the end of this video.  \n\nSince worry is the result of THOUGHT, the antidote to worry is simply to STOP THINKING.  Are you with me?\n\nWe're going to practice this right now by silencing our minds together for 10 seconds.  Ready? let's go.\n\nDid you notice that the yucky feelings of worry disappeared when you stopped thinking??  If you're a chronic worry wart, your homework is to stop thinking (another word for this is meditate) for 10 minutes a day or whenever you notice that you're feeling anxious.\n\nxo.\nkb.", "title": "How Not to Worry | How Do I Stop Worrying?", "publishedDate": "2011-07-13T16:06:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ei52r1Zmc4", "description": ".........................::Rawstyle Nation::.........................\n\nOnly the best Rawstyle tracks will be supported.\n\nArtist:Warface & Luna \n\nYoutube:https://www.youtube.com/user/WarfaceOfficial\nSoundcloud:https://soundcloud.com/warfaceofficial\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/WarfaceOfficial?fref=ts\n\nIf you like the track please Subscribe & Like for more!!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you're the owner of this track.

It is a highly migratory bird, breeding in northern parts of Eurasia and North America and flying south to winter on coastlines almost worldwide. It is the only species of turnstone in much of its range and is often known simply as Turnstone. These specimens were filmed on the Algarve coast of Albufeira, Portugal.\nThe turnstone is a fairly small and stocky bird, 22-24 centimetres long with a wingspan of 50-57 centimetres and a weight of 85-150 grams. The dark, wedge-shaped bill is 2-2.5 centimetres long and slightly upturned. The legs are fairly short at 3.5 centimetres and are bright orange. At all seasons, the plumage is dominated by a harlequin-like pattern of black and white. The head is mainly white with black streaks on the crown and a black pattern on the face. The breast is mainly black apart from a white patch on the sides. The rest of the underparts are white. In flight it reveals a white wingbar, white patch near the base of the wing and white lower back, rump and tail with dark bands on the uppertail-coverts and near the tip of the tail. The female is slightly duller than the male and has a browner head with more streaking.\nThe Ruddy Turnstone has a varied diet including eggs and plant material but it feeds mainly on invertebrates. Insects are particularly important in the breeding season. At other times it also takes crustaceans, molluscs and worms. It often flips over stones and other objects to get at prey items hiding underneath; this behaviour is the origin of the name \"turnstone\". It usually forages in flocks.", "title": "Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria interpres)", "publishedDate": "2008-01-12T17:55:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "7eiy90_AjSs", "description": "Anacin.

You can do this by setting table scapes. Choose a theme and build off of it.\n\nAbove Example:\n\nWe chose a modern chic style table scape. Our colors we incorporated are silver, blue, crystal, white and black. You can choose any scheme you want; just make sure not to use to many personalized, loud or bright colors.\n\nDining Room Staging\nMake sure when your home is on the market that each space in the home is perfect. This means clear out the clutter, clean and stage. Another area of thought is how is your home going to look in photos. This is the area of the house that you can really show off. Why do you think that model homes are fully staged and furnished? Because it sells's the home! We want buyers to feel exciting and inspired while in your home.

The bushes can be evergreen or deciduous and usually grow to about 1.5m high. They do well in pots and you can get a reasonable crop whatever the size of your garden.\n\nSoil preparation\n\u2022Blueberries require light, free-draining acidic soils, with plenty of rich, organic matter if they're to thrive. The soil should have a lower pH of between 4 and 5.5, similar to the requirements of rhododendrons and camellias. It's possible to lower the pH levels of your soil with sulphur chips or dust. However, they'll need to be added three weeks before planting to take effect. \n\u2022Monitor the soil's pH every few years, because it may be necessary to add acid. If you don't have suitable soil, simply grow blueberries in a pot containing ericaceous compost, giving the plants a high potash feed (such as tomato feed) occasionally during the growing season\n\n\u2022Plant two different varieties of blueberries to ensure cross-pollination. A single blueberry plant will produce fruit, but the yields will be higher and the fruits bigger if more than one plant is grown. They require a position in full sun or light shade.\n\u2022Plant blueberries in autumn or winter leaving about 1.5m (5ft) gaps between them and mulch with a layer of acidic peat, wood chippings or pine needles. Water in well using rainwater rather than tap water if possible. Tap water contains lime which renders the soil less acidic over time.\nAftercare\n\u2022Use nets to protect plants from birds in the fruiting season.\n\u2022Mulch each spring. Chipped up pine tree or pine needles are ideal mulches to place around plants because they're fairly acidic. \n\u2022Water plants regularly. They require water from when their buds begin to show in spring until their leaves fall in autumn. Again, remember to use rainwater.\nHarvesting and storage\n\u2022Blueberry fruits, which are borne in clusters, ripen at different times. This could mean having to regularly pick the same bush over the ripening period.\n\u2022Fruits are ready to pick when they have turned a deep blue. The fruit should easily pull away from the cluster when ripe. However, leave them on the bush for a few more days after they turn blue for a more intense and complex flavour. They must be picked or they'll drop.\nPruning blueberries \n\u2022Blueberries produce fruit on branches that were produced the previous year. For the first two or three years of a blueberry's life it's not necessary to prune it much, apart from keeping the plant tidy. After this, blueberries need regular pruning to maintain plant vigour and high quality berry production. Prune them between November and March when the plant is dormant.\n\u2022When pruning, take out any dead, dying and diseased wood. Locate the oldest canes and remove one or two at the base each year. Remove the old canes that don't produce much fruit to make way for younger, more productive canes.\n\u2022Prune out low branches that will lie on the ground when laden with fruit and remove all twiggy wood on the ends of fruiting laterals.", "title": "Growing Blueberries in ericaceous compost.

The first line of the poem exemplifies this disgust, chiding, \"Busy old fool, unruly sun.\" The sun interrupts the speaker's contentment as he lays in bed with his lover, as he implores the sun to go bother \"late school boys and sour prentices.\" The poem, although specifically focusing on a rude disruption, provides a more universal message surrounding the inevitability of time; time continues whether one wants it to--or in the case of the poem--does not. \n\nThe sun represents an unstoppable force, the force of time. Donne hints at this power by constant attacks on the sun, such as the facetious and smug idea that the speaker \"could eclipse and cloud [thy beams] with a wink.\" This attempt at reduction portrays how the speaker is truly fearful of the sun; it possesses such a large amount of power due to the fact that it is seemingly theoretical. One can close his or her eyes and reduce its power, yet looking away does nothing to eliminate an issue. The issue of time cannot be ignored because of its consistency, inevitability, and universal acceptance.\n\nWork Cited:\n\nNarration: \nSpokenVerse. \"The Sun Rising\" by John Donne (read by Tom O'Bedlam).

As per his wishes, the palace will be open as normal today.'\n\nThe Duke married four times; first WHSmith heiress Susan Hornby, mother of his first three children, two of whom survive, second Athina Onassis, with whom he had no children, third Rosita Douglas-Sjernorp, mother of his three younger children, two of whom survive, and fourth, Persian-born Lily Mahtani.\n\nHis four children are the Marquess of Blandford, Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill, 56, Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill, 40, and Lady Alexandra Spencer-Churchill, 38.\n\nThe marquess, his eldest surviving child, battled addictions to heroin and cocaine and three spells in prison, which resulted in his father taking legal action to prevent him from inheriting the 11,500-acre estate, where Churchill was born.\n\nIn 1983 he was fined \u00a3100 for assaulting a policeman, and the following year he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for breach of probation.\n\nHe was put on probation again in 1985 and fined \u00a31,000 for breaking into a chemist's shop and in 1986 he was convicted of drug offences.  At that time he admitted spending \u00a320,000 on cocaine in four months.\n\nFrom the late 1980s through the early 1990s he chalked up a record of motoring offences and was repeatedly banned from driving.\n\nIn May 1994, he was remanded in custody for three weeks in HMP Brixton after failing to keep appointments with probation officers, and the following month he was put on probation for 18 months and ordered to attend a clinic for drug addiction.  \n\nIn December 1999 he was rushed to hospital with a missing eyelid, a badly damaged nose, three missing teeth and a broken shoulder after a car ran into his Toyota Land Cruiser in Kiddington, Oxfordshire.\n\nBut he reformed his behaviour, stayed off the drugs, and after a lengthy legal battle, father and son put their differences behind them and agreed that Blandford would inherit the title while the estate would be run by a board of trustees including his younger brother, Lord Edward.\n\nThe Duke said: 'I think there have been black sheep in every family and there's nothing new about that. We have had some good 'uns and some bad 'uns.'\n\nBut after the rapprochement, he said: 'I am fully confident James will keep this place going.\n\n'But over the top of him \u2013 and over the top of me \u2013 are trustees. You can\u2019t predict the future.'\n\nToday the Prime Minister paid tribute to the Duke, saying: 'I am greatly saddened to hear of the death of the Duke of Marlborough. To me, he was not only the Vice-President of my Association but also a good man and friend.\n\n'His Grace will be deeply missed by all those he worked alongside at Blenheim and by the town of Woodstock where he played such a positive and active role in the community he loved.\n\n'My thoughts and prayers are with all his family and friends at this sad time.'\n\nBlenheim Palace was a gift from Queen Anne to John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough, in 1704.\n\nIt was a reward for his victory over the army of Louis XIV of France in the Spanish War of Succession.\n\nWinston Churchill was born at Blenheim, which became a world heritage site under the stewardship of the 12th Duke.  The 200,000sq ft estate has 187 rooms, dwarfing Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle,and attracts about 500,000 visitors every year.\n\nIts grandeur registered even with Hitler. According to wartime lore, he planned to move in after invading England and ordered the Luftwaffe not to bomb it.", "title": "11Th Duke Of Marlborough Talks Of Blenheim Palace Garden", "publishedDate": "2014-10-16T16:27:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "7fQFvY29ghA", "description": "", "title": "Renato Carosone - Caino e Abele - (Nisa-Carosone) 1978", "publishedDate": "2013-03-16T21:24:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "7fQcDDF0f4c", "description": "", "title": "Water is a Human right", "publishedDate": "2012-11-12T21:21:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "7fQyyyPtDdk", "description": "Lenita Gentil is one of the portuguese most known singers, mostly for her fado work (she's known as a fado singer anyway)\n\nFor the ESC fans, she tried to go to ESC in 1971 with the dramatic song \"Anda ver o sol\", only to be last out of 9 songs and in 1989 with the catchy \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o da roda e fantasia\", again last out of 5 songs\n\nThe song \"Eles foram t\u00e3o longe\" was released as a single in 1982, becoming Lenita's biggest hit of the decade and it's about a group of navigators that leave their country, home and friends, hoping to discover new lands (a nod to the Portuguese discoveries (intesive maritime exploration) of the 15th and 16th centuries)\n\nAt this point, the author and composer of the song, Carlos Pai\u00e3o, was at the peak of his popularity, mostly due to his participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 1981 with the song \"Play-back\", only having 9 points and a shared 18th place\n\nThis didn't mean his carrer was over and in a short time, he became one of the most acclaimed singer-songwriters of the 80's until his sudden death on August 1988 in a car accident.

During his questioning, Congressman Farenthold opted to forgo the opportunity to engage with General Holder based on the fact that the House has voted to hold Holder in contempt of Congress. Instead, Congressman Farenthold gave the following remarks during his designated questioning round in today's hearing:\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nYou know, I understand that this Committee has the constitutional duty of oversight over the Department of Justice and that's why we have Mr. Holder here today -- but I don't think I can be a part of eroding the constitutional balance of power, favoring the executive over the legislative.\n\nI don't think Mr. Holder should be here. He's in contempt of this body. I've called for his resignation, I've sponsored articles of impeachment and, this week, I'm going to be introducing legislation that would prevent federal employees who are held in contempt of Congress or who fail to fully comply with a Congressional subpoena from being paid their taxpayer-funded salary. I'm going to try and get that [the legislation] included with the appropriations bills that'll be going through.\n\nI'm committed to maintaining the constitutional balance of power and the authority this branch -- this Legislative Branch -- has, and I just don't think it's appropriate Mr. Holder be here.

Others translate it at \"Snot-nosed\".\n\nHanatarash are infamous for their extremely dangerous live shows consisting entirely of on-stage destruction and utter disregard for anyone's safety. The most notorious incident involved Yamatsuka throwing junk around with a backhoe inside a venue. On another occasion, he inflicted a deep wound on his leg with an electrical saw, but carried on with the show. A dead cat is also known to have been cut in half during a show. The band once caused so much damage to a live house in Kyoto that it was forced to close.\n\nAt a 1985 gig in Tokyo's Superloft, Hanatarash had the audience fill out forms relieving the band of responsibility for any possible bodily harm caused by the performance. The show stopped just as Yamatsuka was about to throw a lit molotov cocktail onto the stage, which was gasoline-drenched from a barrel. The performance cost the venue \u00a5600,000 ($6000) in repair costs.\n\nSoon unable to be allowed to play anywhere, Yamatsuka went on to form Ultra Freak Out Or Die and Boredoms, among countless other projects. The 1990s saw Hanatarash resurface with some releases and performances, sans on-stage mayhem.\n\n\"4: AIDS-a-Delic\" is one of thier releases and the reason why I say that is because this album was either released in 1996 or 1994. I have used the alternative cover of this album because the original one has female nipples on it and youtube fears those.

A lot of people are worried, and there's a lot different types of annuities out there, but a lot of people are worried that if I saved up a lot of money for retirement, how much can I take out of that?  And just to give you an example, let's say I saved a hundred thousand dollars for retirement, I don't know how much to use each year.  And on one hand I want t use the money because I saved it for my entire life, on the other hand if I take out too much of that money each year in retirement, what happens if I go through it all?  So an annuity comes in to try and answer that question or help people by providing a little bit of certainty.  Like let me give you an example; let's say I had a hundred thousand dollars that I save for retirement, I can take that hundred thousand dollars and buy an annuity with it.  And I'm taking my hundred thousand and I'm exchanging it, and the insurance company that I'm buying the annuity from is going to pay me a certain amount for the rest of my life.  So here's a hundred thousand dollars insurance company and the insurance company is going to pay me, maybe seven thousand dollars every year for the rest of my life.  So what happened there?  It can be great if I live a long life time, I can get well more than my hundred thousand dollars back, but what happens if I die right away?  I just gave a hundred thousand dollars to the insurance company and neither me nor my beneficiaries or my family members got any benefit from that money.  So annuity's real goal is to provide lifetime guaranteed income so that you never have to worry about out living your money.   Now there are other types of annuities out there and the decision to buying annuities can be challenging for a couple of different reasons, annuities are very complex, they have a lot of different terms that can be hard for the average person to understand, and a lot of times the people selling you annuities get paid on a commission basis.  So I think you could see where I'm going with this, if I get paid a thousand dollars to sell you annuity A and five hundred dollars to sell you annuity B, which way do you think somebody's gonna steer you? \nSo always be aware of that when shopping for annuities and make sure annuity is really appropriate for you situation first before moving ahead and investing in one.", "title": "What Is an Annuity? | Financial Terms", "publishedDate": "2011-09-19T16:03:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "7fgYKA1dOyE", "description": "Ketakutan pasukan israel menghadapi penduduk palestina.

They claim to arrive at these long ages using index fossils. Index fossils are creatures that supposedly lived during specific ages. We are told that these ages are independently verified using radiometric dating methods. But is all of this as neat and certain as evolutionists say it is?\n\nRecently, a rock formation in England yielded more than just rocks. This rock layer is said to be 189 million years old, based on its index fossils. The index fossils, ammonites and belemnites, were bottom living deep sea creatures. Along with these deep sea creatures, however, partially petrified wood was also found. One piece was found immediately adjacent to a deep sea fossil. Scientists who believe in young Earth creationism sent samples of the wood to three different radiocarbon dating laboratories. If the index fossil was really as old as evolutionists say, it is almost 4,000 times too old to give a radiocarbon date. Yet all the samples dated at the three laboratories showed consistent young dates. Adjusted by biblical considerations, they date to the time of Noah's Flood.\n\nWe would expect to find land-based life mixed in with deep sea creatures in any rocks that are a result of the violence of the Flood. This find illustrates and supports the biblical account of a worldwide Flood.\n\nPrayer: Lord, the Earth witnesses Your Truth. Help me to do the same. Amen.\n\nReferences: Creation, 3-5/00, pp. 44-47, \"Geological Conflict.\"", "title": "The Deception of Evolutionary Dating", "publishedDate": "2010-05-04T10:47:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "7fgfx0PTBQU", "description": "Released:1995", "title": "Ratos De Por\u00e3o - \"Fejioada Acidente?\"International - Rajoitettu Ydinsota (Rattus cover)", "publishedDate": "2010-11-30T10:26:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7fggyeKC-HE", "description": "steering quickener turned backwards to become a steering slower for better control of a heavy effort steer on a 4wd, 4 wheel steer coot.", "title": "coot steering", "publishedDate": "2014-02-23T16:04:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "7fgrM2zK7Fo", "description": "http://grrlbandgeek.com/blogspot.com\n\nL7 - Fast and Frightening (Original 7\" Version).\n\nThis is the original recording of \"Fast and Frightening\" - different than the \"Smell The Magic\" album version.

See my game notes below. Tropicana, Las Vegas.\n \nGame notes: This is a \"Quad Shot\" progressive game from Ainsworth meaning there are 4 potential progressive jackpots a player can win. If you get 5-of-a-kind symbols without using the wild symbol on the 5th reel (the ship symbol is wild), you win either the Major or Grand progressive (depending on the symbol, letter or non-letter). If you get 5-of-a-kind symbols with the wild ship symbol on the 5th reel that has a framed box (yes, they make it that complicated) you win a smaller-sized progressive (either the Minor or Mini). During the free spins bonus round, the 5th reel is always a wild reel which means that the top 2 progressives jackpots cannot be won. However, the smaller 2 progressives (Minor & Mini) can be won repeatedly if you are lucky enough to get multiple stacked wild reels resulting in multiple 5-of-a-kind symbol winning lines. It also helps that the wild ship symbol in this game may expand and turn its reel completely wild. I observed that the line hit wins on this game are far smaller compared to those on other Ainsworth games that are non-Quad Shot (or non-Double Shot). This is a game where I'm fine min betting (vs. max betting) as I'm really hoping to bank big on winning multiple Minor or Mini progressive jackpots during a bonus round. Outside a bonus round, any size bet also makes you eligible to win the Grand or Major progressives so that's very nice too.", "title": "PEARL POWER | Ainsworth - 19 Progressive Wins!

More early nights means a healthier and faster metabolism + you will have greater nerve energy for the next day as your organs get the rest they need to function healthfully.\n\nHigh carb low fat fruit based lifestyles work wonders for long term weight loss transformations. I've NEVER seen a fat fruit or rice muncher EVER. People sneak in fat and wonder why they get fat.\n\nI'm talking FAT FAT not skinny fat cos someone doesn't move their body and they wonder why they don't have a tight stomach. Weight loss transformation WILL happen when you do the right things. High carb, low fat, early nights, consistent hydration etc.\n\nParticipate in your favourite activities to build the toned body that you want. It's easy to lose weight, but to build a toned body you MUST MOVE IT! :) AND eat enough carb calories so that the active adventure filled lifestyle is EASY to maintain!! So many people make the mistake of not eating enough carb calories DAILY!! That's like wanting to be a big spender on 5$ a day! CHOW DOWN THE CARB CALORIES REGARDLESS OF YOUR WEIGHT!!\n\nMy recommendations for anyone wanting to get fit + stay fit + gain muscle + burn fat is 10g of carbs per kg of bodyweight per day MINIMUM (even on days off) and 1g of carbs per kg of bodyweight per hour when you're out training. I personally drink enough water so I'm urinating at least 10 times a day CLEAR and a few times a night. If my urine is yellow or straw, I drink more, I just knock back a quart and I'm good to go.\nRaw food diet vegan high carb low fat style based on fruit keeps you slim naturally. How to get a flat stomach, how to lose weight with raw foods, how to start a raw food diet? all these questions and more answered by Durianrider & Freelee on our channels.

El no estar de acuerdo con la forma como dios (el dictador) hacia las cosas si eso es ser un pecador .entonces todos vivimos en pecado pues siempre estaremos en desacuerdo con muchas cosas y en rebeli\u00f3n con muchos dictadores y tiranos...

There is a lot you can do so as to stop this from happening. If you want to treat your recurrent bacterial vaginosis and stop it from ever recurring then i suggest you use the methods recommended in the guide above.\n\n\n\nI took a one week treatment for bacterial vaginosis; it was Metronidazole twice a day. I was much better, but 3 weeks later I feel the symptoms coming back and getting worse again. Is this normal? I haven't done anything so I'm not sure if I should be worried that the pain and symptoms are still not gone, after so much time and treatment.\n\nTreating bacterial vaginosis is not that difficult! In fact, in most cases, the infection will go away without you doing anything. The problem usually comes when the infection becomes recurrent. Treating recurrent bacterial vaginosis is actually the difficult side of BV and is always the main topic of discussions in many online health forums. \n\nAs you can see from the question above, many women do suffer from recurrent bouts of BV. So how can you actually get rid of this infection for good? To have an idea on how to stop BV from recurring, you have to first know what causes this infection in the first place and what makes it to keep recurring.\n\nTo begin with, you can get BV from just about anything; sex, sitting on a toilet seat, etc could lead to a change in the pH level down there. And once you get it and do not take proper care of it can easily come right back. With a bacterial infection you only need one tiny little critter to survive the treatment for it to flare up again. So it is very important that you take good care of the infection the very first time you get it. However you don't need to be so down or frustrated when the infection reoccurs! It's really no fault of yours; you've done nothing wrong. You just have to try to treat it more aggressively.\n\n\nThis May Be Why Your Bacterial Vaginosis Keeps Recurring!\n\nIf you have unprotected sex with a guy, they can give it right back to you. So make sure your boy friend also get treated so he doesn't keep giving it back to you. And you also have to watch your diet very closely. If you are diabetic then bacterial vaginosis may happen much easier. Usually having a high sugar diet will cause it to come back again and again. If it persists, see and ask help form your doctor, as only they can help. \n\nEventually if one has it long enough, then it is not uncommon for the condition getting into the entire body at much higher concentration and that is very difficult to get rid of. Plus it makes the entire body to eventually be in a poorer immune situation, if that ever occurs. So, take the medicine as it should be taken, and then follow the doctors recommendations, to the latter.\n\nBacterial vaginosis can also become more prominent when one is put on antibiotics, (and often) or is just not getting enough rest/sleep, been ill otherwise, or definitely (not eating an appropriate diet.) take care of yourself, first!\n\nOver The Counter Drugs\n\nApart from home made cures for BV you can also try over the counter drugs. You can buy the medicine for BV at the drug store without a prescription. It should be near the tampons, sanitary pads, and other \"feminine\" health products. It has to be inserted into the vagina, but it is easy enough, even for a virgin. If over the counter drugs do not work then your best bet will be to try out home remedies.", "title": "Why Bacterial Vaginosis Keeps Recurring   How to Stop Recurrent BV", "publishedDate": "2012-08-11T12:44:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "7gCKgI0niYA", "description": "JETZT KAUFEN!!! \nDas Album \"ALLES ODER NIX\" von XATAR \n\u00dcberall im Handel erh\u00e4ltlich! \n\nFeatures: SSIO, SAMY, Azad, La Honda, Jamila, Jalaal & Jetsett Mehmet", "title": "02.

This gets tough amidst the on-going fight with his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), and his attempt to get back together with his ex-girlfriend, Caitlyn Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer). Meanwhile, his friend and alter ego Randall (Jeff Anderson) is working behind the counter of the adjacent video store -- at least when he feels like it. Randall's unabashed disdain of his place of employment, a long with his self-admitted hatred towards its customers is a sharp contrast to Dante's feeble attempts at the niceties of customer service. Much of the film consists of Randall and Dante's criticism of their customers, their lives, and the world in general. Clerks, filmed in black-and-white on a budget of only $27,000, began the career of writer director Kevin Smith, who would go on to make Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), Dogma (1999), and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001).\n\nclerks.,\"clerks. clip\",\"clerks. movie\",\"clerks.ii trailer\",\"jason mewes\",\"jeff anderson\",\"john henry westhead\",\"leslie hope\",\"cigarette videos\",\"remote control videos\",\"shoe videos\",\"independent comedies\",comedy,\"cult comedies\",\"indie classics\",\"late night comedies\",\"scott mosier\",\"kevin smith\",\"communication videos\",\"understanding videos\",\"sidewalk videos\",jay,\"silent bob\",\"randal graves\",\"olaf the russian metalhead\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++134586,/m/09594c,/m/02q7z2,/m/0gd9k", "title": "Clerks.

Broken nutmeats of the eastern black walnut, from the tree Juglans nigra, are also commercially available in small quantities, as are foods prepared with butternut nutmeats.Walnut seeds are a high density source of nutrients, particularly proteins and essential fatty acids. Walnuts, like other tree nuts, must be processed and stored properly. Poor storage makes walnuts susceptible to insect and fungal mold infestations; the latter produces aflatoxin - a potent carcinogen. A mold infested walnut seed batch should not be screened then consumed; the entire batch should be discarded.Walnuts are rounded, single-seeded stone fruits of the walnut tree. The walnut fruit is enclosed in a green, leathery, fleshy husk. This husk is inedible. After harvest, the removal of the husk reveals the wrinkly walnut shell, which is in two halves. This shell is hard and encloses the kernel, which is also made up of two halves separated by a partition. The seed kernels - commonly available as shelled walnuts - are enclosed in a brown seed coat which contains antioxidants. The antioxidants protect the oil-rich seed from atmospheric oxygen so preventing rancidity.Two major varieties of walnuts are grown for their seeds \u2014 the English Walnut and the Black Walnut. The English Walnut (J. persica) originated in Persia, and the Black Walnut (J. nigra) is native to eastern North America. The Black walnut is of high flavor, but due to its hard shell and poor hulling characteristics it is not grown commercially for nut production. The commercially produced walnut varieties are nearly all hybrids of the English walnut.Other species include J. californica, the California Black Walnut (often used as a root stock for commercial breeding of J. regia), J. cinerea (butternuts), and J. major, the Arizona Walnut.\nWalnuts are late to bear leaves, typically not until more than halfway through the spring. They also secrete chemicals into the soil to prevent competing vegetation from growing. Because of this, flowers or vegetable gardens should not be planted too close to them.\nThe husks of walnut contains a juice that will readily stain anything it comes into contact with. It has been used as a dye for cloth.Walnuts are one of the several high nutrient density foods. 100 grams of walnuts contain 15.2 gram protein, 65.2 gram fat, and 6.7 gram dietary fiber. The protein in walnuts provides many essential amino acids.\nWhile English walnut is the predominant commercially distributed nut because of the ease of its processing, its nutrient density and profile is significantly different than black walnut. The table below compares some of the major nutrients between English and Black walnuts.Raw walnuts contain glyceryl triacylates of the n-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).A study has suggested that consumption of walnuts increases fat oxidation and reduces carbohydrate oxidation without affecting total consumption, suggesting that walnut consumption may improve the use of body fat in overweight adults.Walnuts have been shown to decrease the endothelial dysfunction associated with a high-fat meal.Scientists are not yet certain whether walnuts act as a cancer chemopreventive agent, an effect which may be a result of the fruit's high phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and potent in vitro antiproliferative activity.Compared to certain other nuts, such as almonds, peanuts and hazelnuts, walnuts (especially in their raw form) contain the highest total level of antioxidants, including both free antioxidants and antioxidants bound to fiber.", "title": "Medicinal value of Walnut ( Juglans regia)", "publishedDate": "2012-06-08T03:07:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7gHakXFuZ34", "description": "(3 of 9) This video is a production of the Brain, Mind and Consciousness Lab, Dept.

All legacy repairs and stress areas re-glasses and reinforced.  Special attention applied to center board reinforcing, beam tabs and deck joints.

Realistic's 1950s era version ... very well respected for this purpose, they're smaller, pretty darn effective and extremely well built. In a departure from the hastily made Janzens, we see Realsitc was proud to show off the insides -- they feature high quality HV supplies with oil caps and wirewound resistors ... no corners cut -- really high quality and likely why they still work!   Study all of the Exhibit photos, the original literature, and watch the video -- below for more details. They are great to add to most any 1950s era bookshelf. Keep in mind, both these and the Janzens are strict tweeters. These Realistics have sharp roll-off HF filters, keeping out anything under 5K. This keeps your living room looking clean and modern.  \nKeep in mind electrostatic units like these make UHF output that isn't \"loud\" or nasty -- it's not going to grate on you or shear your ears away  --- UHF from these is very subtle and really adds a sense of depth and air the speaker didn't have before -- that's all.  It's not going to give radical highs that would blow your top off -- or drastically alter the sound of your nice speakers. They are a cool 1950's tweak --  a nice idea to make already natural sounding bookshelf speakers sound more natural.  These are not and large as the larger Janzens of the mid 1950s...that went lower... They're in my opinion best as an addition to AR3's or any speaker with a tweeter that might benefit from a little more twinkle.  Easy to add to any system, as they've got the high-pass filter built right in. You really can't blow these like other nice convential tweets (famously fragile to use are the Altec 3000A, Stephens Tru-Sonic, T35, T350, or the RP302 by Jensen). These are not as agressive, and they're much more rugged in application. \n\nThey are uncommon to find nicely matched, and rarely do sellers bother to test as I have. They were a fairly pricey high-end purchase back in the late 1950s, carrying a price of $75 per pair -- the equivalent of $573 today.  Not many were sold, and few of these survive today. They're cool examples of early electrostatic technology and are still really useful today. \nCopyright 2013, HiFiTown.com", "title": "pair Realistic ElectroStatic Janzen tweeters", "publishedDate": "2013-12-14T04:59:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "7gTzAggWjuM", "description": "", "title": "Halo Reach - bombination", "publishedDate": "2011-01-29T03:42:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "7gTznCJbPVU", "description": "It most certainly looks like ISON has survived perihelion.
