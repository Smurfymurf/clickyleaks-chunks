A late-term abortion using Caesarean section procedures is termed a hysterotomy abortion and is very rarely performed. The first modern Caesarean section was performed by German gynecologist Ferdinand Adolf Kehrer in 1881.\n\nA Caesarean section is usually performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby's or mother's life or health at risk, although in recent times it has also been performed upon request for childbirths that could otherwise have been natural. In recent years the rate has risen to a record level of 46% in China and to levels of 25% and above in many Asian, European and Latin American countries. In 2007, in the United States, the Caesarean section rate was 31.8%. Across Europe, there are significant differences between countries: in Italy the Caesarean section rate is 40%, while in the Nordic countries it is only 14%. Medical professional policy makers find that elective cesarean can be harmful to the fetus and neonate without benefit to the mother, and have established strict guidelines for non-medically indicated cesarean before 39 weeks.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

The eggs are white and are about 1.2 mm in length. Within a day, larvae (maggots) hatch from the eggs; they live and feed on (usually dead and decaying) organic material, such as garbage or feces. They live at least one week. The adults live from two weeks to a month in the wild, or longer in benign laboratory conditions. Some 36 hours after having emerged from the pupa, the female is receptive for mating. Copulation takes a few seconds to a couple of minutes. Normally, the female mates only once, storing the sperm to use it repeatedly for laying several sets of eggs. The flies depend on warm temperatures; generally, the warmer the temperature, the faster the flies will develop. In colder climates, houseflies survive only with humans.\nAlthough they are domestic flies, usually confined to human habitations, they can fly for several miles from the breeding place. They are active only in daytime, and rest at night, e.g., at the corners of rooms, ceiling hangings, cellars, and barns, where they can survive the coldest winters by hibernation, and when spring arrives, adult flies are seen only a few days after the first thaw.", "title": "Housefly are capable of carrying over 100 pathogens (in Assamese - \u09ae\u09be\u0996\u09bf)", "publishedDate": "2013-01-15T06:14:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "77Awg1t0uXs", "description": "Delaware Speedway's mascot, \"Dipstick\", took the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge as Delaware Speedway donated $500 to the cause.

La prensa internacional y las redes sociales tambi\u00e9n se han hecho eco de la noticia.\nCecilia es posiblemente uno de los personajes m\u00e1s buscados hoy en nuestro pa\u00eds. Es la octogenaria vecina de Borja, en Zaragoza que, en un gesto de buena voluntad, decidi\u00f3 restaurar por su cuenta una pintura del s.XIX.\n\nElla lo hizo con su mejor intenci\u00f3n, pero lo cierto es que el resultado es m\u00e1s que discutible. Un equipo de restauradores profesionales se va a hacer cargo de esa obra para intentar que recupere en lo posible su aspecto original. La mujer, de hecho, se ha ofrecido ya a colaborar con ellos.\n\nEst\u00e1 previsto que el pr\u00f3ximo lunes esta espont\u00e1nea restauradora se re\u00fana con este equipo de profesionales. A ellos les va a explicar los materiales utilizados para obtener este sorprendente resultado.\n\nCecilia lleva a\u00f1os restaur\u00e1ndola y nadie se lo hab\u00eda prohibido. Dice que la obra todav\u00eda est\u00e1 por terminar. Sin duda se ha convertido en un atractivo tur\u00edstico para el peque\u00f1o municipio de Borja.\n\nCecilia, de 80 a\u00f1os, se encuentra muy afectada por lo sucedido: \"Si yo he pecado por pintarlo, pido perd\u00f3n, pero lo he hecho con muy buena intenci\u00f3n\". No deja de repetir que no ha podido terminar su trabajo. \"No me arrepiento de querer arreglarlo, pero no he podido terminarlo\".\n\n\"S\u00e9 pintar. Desde peque\u00f1a en el colegio he hecho exposiciones y he vendido muchos cuadros\", asegura Cecilia. Teresa Garc\u00eda, la nieta del verdadero autor de la obra no le guarda rencor: \"Le doy todo mi apoyo, es una se\u00f1ora muy mayor. Estaba la pobre muy disgustada\".\n\nEn la calle, el debate social contin\u00faa. \"No hay derecho. Si se hubiera hecho antes no se hubiera llegado a esta situaci\u00f3n\", cree una vecina. \"Yo tengo cuadros de ella en mi casa y est\u00e1n muy bien. Algo le ha pasado\", afirma otra vecina de Borja.\n\nHoy el muro del templo es casi un lugar de peregrinaci\u00f3n. Todos quieren comprobar con sus propios ojos el antes y el despu\u00e9s del famoso Cristo de Borja.\n\nRepercusi\u00f3n en las redes sociales\nComo ya es habitual en este tipo de casos, la historia del fresco de la iglesia de Borja no ha dejado impasible a nadie. La prensa internacional se ha hecho eco del asunto y las redes sociales se han volcado.\n\nDe \"masacre\" califica en su portada el diario franc\u00e9s Le Monde lo ocurrido en la iglesia de Borja. Un asunto que tambi\u00e9n recoge el brit\u00e1nico Daily Telegraph.\n\nEn la red, la noticia ha corrido como la p\u00f3lvora. En Twitter, el 'Ecce mono' ya es Trending Topic. \"Hola amigos, bienvenidos a Bricoman\u00eda. Hoy vamos a ver como restaurar un 'Ecce homo' del s.XIX\", \"Ahora ya no s\u00e9 si mi hijo me hace dibujos o se dedica a restaurar 'Ecce Homo' en secreto\" y \"Hola, soy la restauradora del 'Ecce Homo'. Aqu\u00ed os dejo un adelanto de mi pr\u00f3xima restauraci\u00f3n, 'La Gioconda'\" son algunos de los tweets que se han hecho eco de la restauraci\u00f3n.\n\nEn Facebook se han creado varios grupos donde no cesan los comentarios: \"De la creadora de 'Las Caras de B\u00e9lmez', llega 'Ecce Homo'\". Avispados comerciantes en menos de 24 horas han puesto a la venta camisetas con la nueva im\u00e1gen.\n\nLo cierto es que ya se cuentan por cientos las hilarantes versiones de la pintura aparecidas en la red en las \u00faltimas horas. Personajes reales y ficticios, obras de arte, cantantes, nobles...

One was done by my sister-in-law with her friends with a melodica and it was also awesome.\n\nI have no idea what possessed me to do this, save for that I was kind of impressed with my work on Holiday, and I've been listening to the Fleet Foxes' CD recently.  I wanted to do more things with multiples of myself, and I could think of too many other songs with three part harmony...too many others that I could reasonably perform at least.\n\nOverall I was shocked how well this worked, and how nice the animated mask on my foot is (in the very beginning of the video you can actually see the middle guy kick his foot in front of the guitar on the right).  It's a small thing but it really completes the video.\n\nAs for the quality of the music, I know there are some mistakes, and the mandolin was hideously out of tune, but really the guitar and vocals cover it up.  I'm actually quite happy with how it came out.  I really don't know whether or not what I'm doing is really going to work until I get it into the computer.  I was floored by how well this one worked.  Perhaps it will be incentive to keep working on this stuff.

Waldnessel\nSumpfziest (Stachys palustris L.) Schweiner\u00fcbe\n\n\nWaldziest (Stachys sylvatica L.)\n\nPflanzennamen im Volksmund\nWaldziest, Waldnessel\nSumpfziest: Schweiner\u00fcbe\n\nWissenschaftlicher Name\nWaldziest: Stachys sylvatica L.\nSumpfziest: Stachys palustris L.\n\nPflanzenfamilie\nLippenbl\u00fctler (Lamiaceae)\n\nHeilkr\u00e4uter / Anwendung\nKr\u00e4mpfe, Menstruation, Ohrensausen, Wechseljahre.\nSteckbrief / Beschreibung\n\nWaldziest und Sumpfziest sind kr\u00e4ftige Pflanzen, die in fast allen L\u00e4ndern Europas weit verbreitet sind. Der aus dem griechischen stammende Gattungsname Stachys bedeutet \u00c4hre und deutet auf die Form des Bl\u00fctenstandes hin. Wie der Name vermuten l\u00e4sst, findet man den Waldziest mit seinen purpurroten Bl\u00fcten in Laub- und Mischw\u00e4ldern. Hier ist die Pflanze weit verbreitet. Waldziest riecht unangenehm nach Wanzen. Der Sumpfziest w\u00e4chst entlang von Gr\u00e4ben und auf feuchten Ackerb\u00f6den. Der Sumpfziest bildet rosa bis rotviolette, wei\u00df gefleckte Bl\u00fcten. Beide Ziest-Arten erreichen eine Wuchsh\u00f6he von etwa 1 m. Die Pflanzen werden gerne von Schafen und Ziegen abgeweidet, ihre Bl\u00fcten von Bienen und Hummeln besucht. Die knollig verdickten Bodenausl\u00e4ufer des Sumpfziests verwendetet man fr\u00fcher in einigen Gegenden als Ersatz f\u00fcr den eigentlichen Knollenziest (S. sieboldii Miq.) zu Nahrungszwecken genutzt.\n\nIn der Naturheilkunde werden Wald- und Sumpfziest nur noch selten verwendet. Beide Ziest-Arten besitzen krampfl\u00f6sende Eigenschaften, der Waldziest wirkt au\u00dferdem menstruationsregulierend, der Sumpfziest harntreibend. Beide Ziest-Arten sind ausdauernde Pflanzen, je nach Standort erreichen sie eine Wuchsh\u00f6he von 40 bis 120 cm. Die St\u00e4ngel der Pflanzen sind bebl\u00e4ttert und behaart.\n\nWaldziest: Die gr\u00fcn gef\u00e4rbten und gestielt wachsenden Bl\u00e4tter des Waldziests sind herzf\u00f6rmig, die Blattr\u00e4nder sind ges\u00e4gt. Die sich in drei- bis sechsbl\u00fctigen Scheinquirlen bilden Bl\u00fcten des Waldziests haben eine dunkel purpurrote F\u00e4rbung.\n\nSumpfziest: Beim Sumpfziest wachsen die unteren Bl\u00e4tter kurz gestielt, die Bl\u00e4tter im oberen Bereich der Pflanze sind sitzend. Die Blattform ist l\u00e4nglich-lanzettlich, die Blattr\u00e4nder sind ges\u00e4gt. Die sich in vier- bis achtbl\u00fctigen Scheinquirlen bilden Bl\u00fcten des Sumpfziest haben eine dunkel rosa F\u00e4rbung mit wei\u00dfen Flecken.\nStandort / Hier findet man den Ziest\n\nDer Waldziest w\u00e4chst im gesamten europ\u00e4ischen Raum. Im Mittelmeerraum sind die Pflanzen jedoch nur sehr selten zu finden. Als Standort bevorzugt der Waldziest nicht allzu trockene W\u00e4lder.\n\nDer Sumpfziest w\u00e4chst, mit Ausnahme des Mittelmeerraumes ebenfalls im gesamten Europa. Sumpfziest bevorzugt feuchtere Standorte als der Waldziest. Gew\u00f6hnlich findet man diese Pflanze in dauerfeuchten Gr\u00e4ben und auch an Flussufern.\nWirkung der Heilpflanze / Heilwirkung - Ziest\n\nWaldziest: krampfl\u00f6send, reguliert die Menstruation, sedativ Sumpfziest: krampfl\u00f6send, harntreibend\nIn der Naturheilkunde verwendete Pflanzenteile\n\nIn der Naturheilkunde benutzt man von dem Waldziest und auch von dem Sumpfziest die bl\u00fchenden Sprossspitzen. Der Sammelzeitraum erstreckt sich vom Juni bis in den September.\nAnwendung mit der Heilkraft dieser Pflanze\n\nDer Ziest wird in der Pflanzenheilkunde innerlich angewendet. Anwendungen mit den Ziest-Arten in der Naturheilkunde finden Sie unter folgenden Stichworten:\n\nKr\u00e4mpfe, Menstruation, Ohrensausen, Wechseljahre\nBitte beachten Sie auch diesen Hinweis\n\nObwohl die Anwendungen mit Heilkr\u00e4utern oft eine positive Wirkung auf Beschwerden haben, sollte man vor der Heilpflanzenanwendung immer R\u00fccksprache mit einem Arzt halten. Dies gilt auch f\u00fcr Anwendungen mit dem Sumpf- und Waldziest.", "title": "Ziest-Arten. Waldziest, Waldnessel.

Time is experienced differently and the journey's time is radically different to that experienced by those on Earth.\n\nAbout Proxima Centauri:\n\nProxima Centauri (Latin proxima, meaning \"next to\" or \"nearest to\") is a red dwarf about 4.24 light-years from the Sun, inside the G-cloud, in the constellation of Centaurus. It was discovered in 1915 by Scottish astronomer Robert Innes, the Director of the Union Observatory in South Africa, and is the nearest known star to the Sun, although it is too faint to be seen with the naked eye, with an apparent magnitude of 11.05. Its distance to the second- and third-nearest stars, which form the bright binary Alpha Centauri, is 0.237 \u00b1 0.011 ly (15,000 \u00b1 700 AU). Proxima Centauri is very likely part of a triple star system with Alpha Centauri A and B.\n\nBecause of the proximity of this star, its distance from the Sun and angular diameter can be measured directly, from which it can be determined that its diameter is about one-seventh of that of the Sun. Proxima Centauri's mass is about an eighth of the Sun's, and its average density is about 40 times that of the Sun. Although it has a very low average luminosity, Proxima is a flare star that undergoes random dramatic increases in brightness because of magnetic activity. The star's magnetic field is created by convection throughout the stellar body, and the resulting flare activity generates a total X-ray emission similar to that produced by the Sun. The mixing of the fuel at Proxima Centauri's core through convection and the star's relatively low energy-production rate suggest that it will be a main-sequence star for another four trillion years, or nearly 300 times the current age of the universe.\n\nSubscribe to stay updated and educated. .\n\nMust Watch: \n\n'Pulsars and Quasars' - Learn about the monsters of the universe: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLke8o-yBwNzGJTEsFJd8sZrnHsxs08dQ3\n\n'Science Fact or Science Fiction?' - Find out what's real and what's made up in science and space: - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLke8o-yBwNzHxkSj5pzt5zY-fqgVRd8gz\n\n'Top 10 Biggest Blasts' - A countdown of the biggest explosions ever to occur: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLke8o-yBwNzGPSTYh_OpFziFGwORWUCxZ\n\n'Time Travel' - Is it possible?: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLke8o-yBwNzHOv_AAQcWVjFIh25yPNsrF\n\n'7 Wonders of the Solar System' - Our Solar System isn't as boring as you think - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLke8o-yBwNzHxyG69NPYa15a-NLd4wCR3\n\n'Black Holes' - The end, the infinite, the all consuming: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLke8o-yBwNzE9XolnbnHMdiJe7sCMCIbp", "title": "A voyage to Proxima Centauri at hyperspeed", "publishedDate": "2014-05-28T02:19:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "77gekv7JuoA", "description": "Working Toward Proper Groundwater Branding\n\nGroundwater is the main raw material in mineral water, soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, and food processing.

Other species of Actinidia are native to India, Japan, and southeastern Siberia.\n\nCultivation of the fuzzy kiwifruit spread from China in the early 20th century to New Zealand, where the first commercial plantings occurred. The fruit was called \"yang tao\", but was changed to \"Chinese gooseberry\" by the New Zealanders.It proved popular with American servicemen in New Zealand during World War II. Because of this, the fruit was exported to California using the names \"Chinese gooseberry\" and \"melonette\". Because the California-based importer rejected these names, the fruit was rebranded \"kiwifruit\" because of its resemblance to the New Zealand kiwi bird.\n\nKiwifruit has since become a common name for all commercially grown fruit from the genus Actinidia.\n\nAlmost all kiwifruit sold belong to a few cultivars of fuzzy kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa): 'Hayward', 'Blake', and 'Saanichton 12'.They have a fuzzy, dull-brown skin, and bright-green flesh. The familiar cultivar 'Hayward' was developed by Hayward Wright in Avondale, New Zealand, around 1924.It was initially grown in domestic gardens, but commercial planting began in the 1940s.\n\n'Hayward' is the most commonly available cultivar in stores. It is a large, egg-shaped fruit with a sweet flavor. 'Saanichton 12', from British Columbia, is somewhat more rectangular than 'Hayward' and comparably sweet, but the inner core of the fruit can be tough. 'Blake' can self-pollinate, but it has a smaller, more oval fruit and the flavor is considered inferior.\n----------------\nVisit my blog: http://donaldsharev.blogspot.com\nVisit my channel: http://youtube.com/donaldsharev\nSUBSCRIBE: \n\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/donaldsharev\ntumblr: http://donaldsharev.tumblr.com/\n----\nThanks for watching!\nPost comment, share, like and tell me what you think!\n- Donald.\n\nhttp://www.ask.com/  http://vk.com/\nhttp://www.yandex.ru/  https://twitter.com/\nhttp://www.liveleak.com/  http://www.wykop.pl/\nhttp://www.bing.com/  https://www.tumblr.com/\nhttp://www.reddit.com/  http://www.google.com/\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/  https://www.facebook.com/", "title": "Cutting bright green flesh Kiwi fruit Ultra HD 4K", "publishedDate": "2014-11-06T11:04:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "77vv-CqQimk", "description": "**After MONTHS! away from my decks, \nthis is  me tryin to cut it up again....\n\nBeware!!

One person died and all others were hospitalized due to their illnesses. One woman suffered a miscarriage as a result of her Listeria infection.\nSymptoms of Listeria infection include fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Symptoms are typically more serious in frail or elderly people, and others with compromised immune systems. Pregnant women infected with Listeria can suffer miscarriage or give birth to stillborn babies.\nThe recalled cheeses were distributed nationwide through retail and foodservice outlets as well as by mail order.  Both Whole Foods and Kroger stores initiated their own recalls of Craves Brothers cheeses after learning of the potential Listeria risk.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\nhttp://www.marlerclark.com/craves-brothers-listeria-cheese-outbreak-lawyer/\nhttp://www.about-listeria.com/", "title": "Crave Farms Cheese Listeria Outbreak and Recall", "publishedDate": "2013-07-09T01:22:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "781Bkot8sJA", "description": "Lyrics: Strikeout,Director: Pavel Pavlov,Music: Jazzy/Jazzyflavour\nPrtoducer :Sma$h\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Strike...", "title": "Strikeout-Real Thing", "publishedDate": "2013-02-12T19:08:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "781Gb3NfieI", "description": "", "title": "15 CATANANCHE-TELE DivX.avi", "publishedDate": "2010-02-22T18:23:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "781M9ZWAWMU", "description": "Tutorial over de uitspraak van het alfabet in het Engels.\nProduced by Lentiz LIFE College - MultiMedia & Digital Design.", "title": "Alfabet in Engels", "publishedDate": "2012-06-12T14:10:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "781ojzDj1Iw", "description": "SUBSCRIBE and LIKE OUR FaceBook Page AT : https://www.facebook.com/NoypiTV?ref=hl\n\nAKSYON | Humarap na sa News5  ang Juan Direction member na si Daniel Marsh upang sagutin ang mga usap-usapan sa social media na pambubugbog niya diumano sa isang taxi driver.", "title": "DANIEL MARSH, NAGSALITA NA SA PAKIKIPAG-AWAY DIUMANO SA TAXI DRIVER", "publishedDate": "2014-07-24T15:13:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "782a0iWwza0", "description": "\"Absolutely no copyright infringement is intended.

Shortly after the two stood to attention for the national anthems of Japan and Laos, Mr Bounnhang accompanied the prince to inspect a guard of honour.\n\nIn talks after the welcoming ceremony, the vice president expressed his warmest welcome to the prince and his delegation. The two highly valued the traditional relations and growing cooperation between Laos and Japan.\n\nLao leaders and members of the Imperial Family of Japan have exchanged visits over the years, the press release said.\n\nPresident Choummaly Sayasone paid an official visit to Japan in March 2010 when the two countries marked the 55th anniversary of diplomatic relations. He also met Japan's Emperor Akihito. In the same year, His Imperial Highness Prince Akishino and his daughter Mako visited Laos.\n\nMr Bounnhang said he highly valued the visit of the Crown Prince. The visit would enhance the close contact and mutual understanding between high-level leaders of Laos and the Imperial Family of Japan, he said, as well as understanding between the two peoples.\n\nThe Lao leader expressed hope that the visit of the prince would promote greater investment by the Japanese private sector in Laos.\n\nLaos has received enormous assistance from the government and people of Japan.\n\nThe Japanese government provides about US$80 million in official development assistance (ODA) to Laos every year on average, making Japan Laos's single largest ODA provider, according to the Ministry of Planning and Investment.\n\nOn the same day, the prince received a courtesy visit from the President of the Laos-Japan Friendship Association, Dr Ponmek Dalaloy, the press release said.\n\nThe Crown Prince also met with Prime Minister Thongsing Thammavong. The Lao premier expressed his great appreciation for the cooperation and mutual assistance through bilateral and multilateral frameworks, as well as in the regional arena.\n\nOn behalf of the Lao government and people, Mr Thongsing expressed his gratitude to the government and people of Japan for the valuable assistance and support they have extended to Laos, especially in hosting the upcoming 9th Asia-Europe Meeting Summit.\n\nHe expressed his appreciation to the Crown Prince for the manner in which the two countries have supported one another in the regional and international arenas.\n\nLater, the Crown Prince met with President Choummaly Sayasone. The president said he highly valued the visit of the prince to Laos, which he said was significant in further strengthening the bilateral relations between Laos and Japan.\n\nThe president said such visits would promote mutual understanding between the two peoples and believed it would encourage more Japanese to invest in and visit Laos.\n\nFor his part, the Crown Prince thanked the Lao government and people for the warm welcome extended to him and his delegation. He also thanked the Lao people for the relief assistance they provided to victims of the tsunami that devastated Japan in early 2011.\n\nThe two spoke highly of the growing bilateral friendly relations and cooperation between Laos and Japan.\nThe Lao president then hosted a banquet in honour of Japan's Crown Prince and his delegation, which was attended by high-level officials from both sides.", "title": "Japan's Crown Prince makes landmark visit to Laos", "publishedDate": "2012-07-02T03:35:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "78OTsClZIXc", "description": "The fern-leaf peony is one of Doug Green's favorites  http://www.youtube.com/user/headgardener2u/  but it's a short-bloom peony - with flowers lasting about 10 days.

Corruption, like bribery, abuse of power and secret dealings are still \"very high\" in many countries. This week (December 5, 2012) Transparency International released its yearly Corruption Perceptions Index. The Berlin-based group rates 176 countries and territories with a number from 100 to zero. Bigger numbers are better. The index measures the perceived, or apparent, level of corruption in a country. The group uses information from the African Development Bank, the World Bank and the World Economic Forum. Corruption takes many forms. Transparency International calls it \"the abuse of entrusted power for private gain.\" One common form is bribery: the use of money or gifts to persuade another person to do something wrong or illegal. Corruption is not easy to measure because it is secretive. But the World Bank has estimated that about $1 trillion in bribes are paid every year worldwide. Stealing public money is another form of corruption. Huguette Labelle is chair of Transparency International. She says the problem of corruption affects millions of people and limits their ability to get essential services like water, education, health, and licenses. A group of small, developed nations scored highest on the new list. Denmark, Finland and New Zealand received a rating of 90. Among large nations, the United States rated 73 while China rated 39. The countries with the greatest perceived level of corruption on the list are Somalia, North Korea and Afghanistan with scores of 8. Robin Hodess directs research at Transparency International. She says transparency international needs evidence about how corruption works, and needs to know where to target the reforms needed to promote accountability and integrity.\" The perceptions held by experts, businesses and organizations are important. The World Bank notes that countries showing improvements had greater foreign investment and economic growth.

You will encounter some enemies and have to pass a bridge. Take out all enemies that move towards you and keep the ones on the bridge alive. They will be standing very close together which should make it easy to kill at least 2 with one grenade. Just wait at the doorway in front of them. After a couple seconds they should throw a grenade. A little timer will appear next to the grenade. Press Triangle when the cursor is in the white colored area. The grenade will explode when your timing isn't correct. It's highly recommended to do this on very easy. Otherwise, you will most likely die when you fail throwing back a grenade. Reload the checkpoint if you mess up.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=powerpyx\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFollow Me:\nhttp://www.powerpyx.com\nhttp://www.youtube.com/PowerPyx\nhttp://www.facebook.com/PowerPyx\nhttp://www.twitter.com/PowerPyx\n\nContact Me:\nmail@powerpyx.com\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~", "title": "Uncharted 3 - Throwback Master Trophy Guide", "publishedDate": "2011-11-01T18:57:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "78RacwVgkzs", "description": "Dr. Marcel Londt, a doctor of psychology who has worked with victims and perpetrators of rape in South Africa for more than 20 years, discusses the pattern of men coming out of prison and taking out their aggression on their intimate partners.", "title": "Conflicting ideas about victimization of perpetrators", "publishedDate": "2013-03-21T00:39:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "78S76lEhz-o", "description": "A Navy SEAL canine has left the battlefield of Afghanistan and is now a part of the sheriff's department.", "title": "Elite Navy SEAL dog finds new role in San Diego", "publishedDate": "2013-05-04T02:20:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "78SD2jPFcmA", "description": "Novel Foot bath design for Dairy Cows used in a dairy herd in Lancashire.

Efficiency, Amenities, and Technology. The number one thing buyers want is Energy-star rated appliances. This was followed closely by energy efficiency in the laundry room.  Permanently lowering utility bills is a highly desirable feature. \nOf those polled, 62 percent favored high-quality products over space. Home buyers seem to prefer high-end amenities, even if it means living in a smaller home to get them.. bye bye McMansion. \nSome of the other desired amenities toping their list? were double sinks in the kitchen, a tub and shower stall in the bath. The last thing buyers want: technology: everything from remotely controlled utilities, entertainment to security systems. \nOn the flip side, what DON'T homebuyers want? An elevator is the number one amenity consumers don't want, followed closely by wine refrigerators, golf course communities, and outdoor kitchens. \nAll good things to keep in mind when buying or renovating.

Anyway please tell me \nwhat you think I hope someone likes it lol Please Rate And Comment it means a lot to me thanks xx\n\nThe relationship between King Henry and Anne Boleyn was one that involved many different things. They really did love each other but sadly there were many other factors and people that meant in the end it ended very tragically. Many will think that this was because Henry was so worried about Anne not giving him a son but truthfully I think this was only a small part. Anne hated that Henry had so many affairs, and who wouldn't after 7 years of him being totally devoted to only her, and she just was not the average kind of woman of her time. She was not afraid to say what she really felt, she had opinions of her own on subjects that were usually reserved only for men and she loved her husband just that little bt to much and was unable to turn her head away when he strayed because he truly broke her heart. Anyway in this video I hoped that I could get across some of the happy things about their relationship aswell as the sad. And anyway no matter how much Henry hurt and humiliated Anne, as it says in the video, she had her final victory because it was her daughter who went onto became a truly formidable Queen.\n\nDisclaimer: I own nothing...this was done only for entertainment thanks", "title": "The Love of Anne Boleyn and King Henry VIII - Greensleeves (The Tudors)", "publishedDate": "2009-05-03T09:21:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "78roDoj4TFc", "description": "We show you round the Range Rover Sport SVR.

You \"cut on the beveled face\" with curved movements. The handle is rugged to give a good grasp. The axe has a 4-1/3\" face, 2-lb. head, and a 14\" hickory handle. A 36 page Axe book is included with each purchase. 20 Year Guarantee.\nWhen it comes to axe enthusiasts, the Swedes are the world's greatest, and Gransfors Bruks is one of their finest forges. Each axe is carefully forged by an experienced smith who shows his pride in his work by stamping his initials on the head next to the company logo and each smith is introduced in the 36 page booklet that accompanies every Gransfors Bruks axe. After forging, each blade is ground to a 25 degree bevel and honed to a razor edge. Each axe is fitted with a tight-grained hickory handle and provided with a grain-leather sheath with snap fastener.\n\nView all Gransfors Bruks Axes... http://www.osograndeknives.com/store/catalog/m-gransfors-bruks-axes-120-1.html\n\nConnect with us:\nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCisEjTTEEcQi4Jrwcx98TpA\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/OsoGrandeKnives/136063446536995\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/111141540911705284012/posts\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OsoGrandeKnives\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/osograndeknives/\nKnife Blog: http://osograndeknives.blogspot.com/\nOfficial Website: http://www.osograndeknives.com/", "title": "Gransfors Bruks Swedish Carving Axe Review | OsoGrandeKnives", "publishedDate": "2013-09-25T13:40:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "78u2J8tqahs", "description": "Demonstration of an exceedance occurence recording by a Bell 407 gauge with caution light illumination.", "title": "Bell 407 Power Limit Exceedance Display and Recording", "publishedDate": "2014-01-25T20:30:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "78uE1LinQlA", "description": "Here's a very intense gameplay highlight as a Spy in the 'Spies vs Mercs' game mode of Splinter Cell: Blacklist.

On one end, you have a team of agile, stealthy Spies looking to infiltrate a location and hack terminals to gather information, all while remaining undetected. On the other end, you have a team of heavily armed and powerful Mercs that must defend their terminals and stop the Spies from gathering the data by any means necessary. Each team has different abilities and tools that they must leverage to outsmart their opponents, setting the tone for big rivalries and very fun competitive gameplay.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/Threatty\n\nTwitch:\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/Threatty\n\nBuy games at a discount:\nhttp://www.gamefanshop.com/partner-Threatty/\n\nPrevious uploads:\n\nBattlefield 3: Funtage V2 by Threatty - Fails, Lols & Trolling \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grZg_I05cHU\n\nM1911 | Battlefield 3 Weapontage\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0RCvbSX3I4\n\nBack on the Battlefield - G53 Killfest\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAU6tfvhRYM\n\nBullet Time 2 | Battlefield 3 Montage by Threatty\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNSJDfse_oU", "title": "Splinter Cell Blacklist: Spy Kill Streak while Hacking 100% (SvM)", "publishedDate": "2013-09-01T09:34:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "78uSjoJ9IaI", "description": "Power 105.1FM The Breakfast Club 2014.

Hrvatska i dalje s Belgijom predvodi ljestvicu s 13 bodova iz pet susreta, a Srbija je ostala na samo \u010detiri boda.\n\n\nTvrd po\u010detak\n\nUnato\u010d najavama, Hrvatska nije uspjela odmah na po\u010detku pritisnuti protivnika. Srbija se uspjela oduprijeti i borba se vodila uglavnom na sredini terena. Ve\u0107 u osmoj minuti Srbija je morala promijeniti igra\u010da. Ozlije\u0111enog napada\u010da Marka \u0160\u0107epovi\u0107a zamijenio je Filip \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107. \n\nU 15. minuti Hrvatska je postigla pogodak, ali na\u017ealost iz zale\u0111a. Nabacivanje s lijeve strane Oli\u0107 je glavom prebacio loptu, Mand\u017euki\u0107 je bio vi\u0161i od vratara \u017deljka Brki\u0107a, ali je bio u nedopu\u0161tenom polo\u017eaju.\n\nU 18. minuti prva prilika Srbije. Aleksandar Kolarov je izvrsno uposlio u na\u0161em \u0161esnaestercu Filipa \u0110uri\u010di\u0107a, koji se probio do gol crte i poku\u0161ao vratiti u sredinu, ali je Darijo Srna izvsrno uklizao i odnio loptu izvan terena. \n\n\nMand\u017euki\u0107 iskoristio poklon Srbije\n\nVatreni su poveli u 23. minuti. Mand\u017euki\u0107 je presjekao loptu Kolarova, Rakiti\u0107 je u prazan uposlio Oli\u0107a, koji se sjurio prema srpskim vratima, a onda izvrsno uposlio na lijevoj strani Mand\u017euki\u0107a, koji je mirno zakucao mre\u017eu za vodstvo Hrvatske.\n\nNakon primljenog pogotka, Srbija je po\u010dela igrati malo otvorenije, no nijedna mom\u010dad nije uspjela iskoristiti malo vi\u0161e prostora u sredini.\n\nOli\u0107 za veliku prednost\n\nU 36. minuti po\u017eutio je Kolarov zbog prekr\u0161aja na Mand\u017euki\u0107u 35 metara s desne strane. Vatreni su to iskoristili na najbolji mogu\u0107i na\u010din. Srna je izvrsno nabacio iza le\u0111a srpske obrane na lijevu vratnicu. Najbr\u017ei je bio Oli\u0107, koji je prsima pospremio loptu u gol i tako pove\u0107ao prednost na 2:0.\n\nU 40. minuti opasan udarac iz desnog kuta za Srbiju. Lopta je preletjela na lijevu stranu. Tamo je bio najvi\u0161i \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, ali okru\u017een hrvtskim brani\u010dima nije uspio dobro zahvatiti loptu. Dvije minute poslije uslijedila je pogre\u0161ka hrvatske obrane, ali su Srna i Vedran \u0106orluka uspjeli otkloniti opasnost.\n\n\nPrva opasnija prilika Srbije\n\nOd samog po\u010detka drugo poluvrijeme ponudilo je puno sadr\u017eajniji nogomet. Prvu priliku imala je Srbija. U 47. minuti Kolarov se probio kroz sredinu, topovski pucao, ali je Stipe Pletikosa izvrsno reagirao i uspio odbiti loptu. Lopta je stigla do \u0110uri\u010di\u0107a, koji je pucao, a \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 je samo skrenuo loptu loja je zavr\u0161ila pored desne vratnice.\n\nHrvatska je uzvratila samo minutu poslije dalekometnim poku\u0161ajem Luke Modri\u0107a. U 52. minuti novi solo prodor Modri\u0107a, koji je pucao s 20 metara, ali je lopta zavr\u0161ila tik pored desne vratnice.\n\nU 60. minuti Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107 izvrsno je uposlio Srnu, koji je ubacio u sredinu, ali je Oli\u0107 bio za korak prekratak. Nakon neuspje\u0161nog udarca iz kuta, lopta se ponovno odbila do Rakiti\u0107a, koji je prevario srpskog brani\u010da i uputio o\u0161tar udarac, ali je Brki\u0107 zo uspio obraniti.\n\n\nPritisak Srbije\n\nU 69. minuti opasan poku\u0161aj \u0110uri\u010di\u0107a, a \u0161est minuta poslije nova opasna prilika Srbije. Tadi\u0107 je ostao sam u na\u0161em \u0161esnaestercu, ali je Strini\u0107 u posljednji tren uklizao. U 78. minuti najbolja prilika Srbije. Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107 petom je uposlio natr\u010dalog \u0110uri\u010di\u0107a \u010diji je izvrstan udarac Pletikosa odbio, a zatim obranio i poku\u0161aj \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107a.\n\nPosljednjih pet minuta Hrvatska \u010duva veliku prednost. Ipak, u drugoj minuti suda\u010dke nadoknade novi opasan poku\u0161aj Srbije, ali Pletikosa je ponovno iza\u0161ao kao pobjednik.\n\nU druga dva susreta u skupini Belgija je s 2:0 slavila kod Makedonije, a Wales je s 2:1 slavio kod \u0160kotske. \n\n\n\u0160timac iznenadio debijem Kova\u010di\u0107a\n\nIzbornik Igor \u0160timac iznenadio je uvr\u0161tavanjem mladog Matea Kova\u010di\u0107a umjesto Ognjena Vukojevi\u0107a. \u0160timac se odlu\u010dio za sljede\u0107i sastav: Stipe Pletikosa na vratima, u zadnjoj liniji Darijo Srna, Vedran \u0106orluka, Josip \u0160imuni\u0107 i Ivan Strini\u0107, u vezi Ivan Rakiti\u0107, Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107, Luka Modri\u0107 i Niko Kranj\u010dar, a u napadu Ivica Oli\u0107 i Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107.\n\nIzbornik Srbije odlu\u010dio se za sljede\u0107e igra\u010de: \u017deljko Brki\u0107, Branislav Ivanovi\u0107, Neven Suboti\u0107, Matija Nastasi\u0107, Aleksandar Kolarov, Zoran To\u0161i\u0107, Aleksandar Ignjovski, Ivan Radovanovi\u0107, Alen Stevanovi\u0107, Filip \u0110uri\u010di\u0107 i Marko \u0160\u0107epovi\u0107. \n\nVrata maksimirskog stadiona bila su otvorena ve\u0107 u 15 sati, a rasprodani Maksimir je napunilo 35.000 gledatelja sat i pol prije utakmice.

We pushed them back.\n\n\"I think we felt we had done enough to come away with three points.\n\n\"I thought the referee had a good game. He obviously saw a free kick against Fortune and gave it. You have to abide by the decisions.\n\n\"I am trying to build a team not just to win the league this season but for the next four or five years and hopefully our brand of football will do that in the long run.\"\n\nRangers manager Walter Smith:\n\"We were very fortunate to get a draw. Celtic started the better side.\n\n\"Celtic played very well. It was a tough afternoon for a lot of our boys.\n\n\"I felt the second half we did a little bit better.\n\n\"We are delighted to have got a point from a game we should not have. We were not with the pace of the game at all.\"", "title": "YNWA - Celtic v.

It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in the Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.\nThe giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold colouring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat.\nIn the wild, the giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly Sichuan Province. Giant pandas are generally solitary, and each adult has a defined territory, and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range.\nDespite its taxonomic classification as a carnivore, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively of bamboo. Pandas are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mother's faeces to digest vegetation. However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes, and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. The giant panda is a \"highly specialized\" animal with \"unique adaptations\", and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of years\nGiant pandas reach sexual maturity between the ages of four and eight, and may be reproductive until age The mating season is between March and May, when a female goes into oestrus, which lasts for two or three days and only occurs once a year. When mating, the female is in a crouching, head-down position as the male mounts her from behind. Copulation time is short, ranging from 30 seconds to five minutes, but the male may mount her repeatedly to ensure successful fertilization. The gestation period ranges from 95 to 160 days.", "title": "Panda Showing gymnastics ! \u30d1\u30f3\u30c0\u76ee\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3057\u4f53\u64cd", "publishedDate": "2014-01-17T20:36:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "793HwYR12gE", "description": "I picked up more of the Disney Figural Keychain blind bags!

I'm Mike Patrick and this is how to do a one-handed shuffle. It looks like this. You take the cards and shuffle them with one hand like this. The grip is a little bit unusual. You have three fingers on one end of the deck and your pinky and thumb on the other side. So, if I remove the deck, it's like this and if I place the deck back it's around here. What you're going to do is divide approximately, and you want this to be relatively exact, you want to get half the deck to break off with your thumb. I lift up with my thumb here. These two fingers let go let go at this point. I'm going to move my thumb counterclockwise, pivoting along the index finger and this packet is going to move clockwise. This is what it's going to look like. These two move at the same rate until they're here. \n\nThe two outer fingers now regroup this edge and pull it so that they are even with each other. It's a very slight adjustment when this happens, about a quarter of an inch, depending on your hand size. You then take the two back portions and you shuffle those together with even pressure from your thumb. This is going to take the most work. One more time, you have the pinky here and the thumb. You break upwards with your thumb. Your fingers move out of the way. It pivots around the index finger so they swirl on opposite directions. I reapply those two fingers, aligning the packets. And now I place those together and I cause them to weave at an angle. So now I should have sort of a V from my perspective. Now the cards are ready to be bridged. I turn them over. \n\nI apply pressure like in a normal shuffle and I let go of them. They will fall over the floor when you try to do this. It's unavoidable but eventually you can use your hand or cradle if you feel more comfortable. But eventually over time you should just be able to do it in the air like this. I'll go over it really slowly one more time. The pinky is here towards this pip on that side. The thumb breaks the packet. I remove these fingers and I pivot this across. They're aligned with each other. These cards get farrowed the other cards and then I turn over and I shuffle them like this. Here's one quick variation that I can show you that I do. You can cut off about a third of the deck. If you do that, when these cards are in this orientation you can use your index finger to move this packet forward so this just pivots along these, goes into this hand, and you do a thumb cut so your thumb comes over. This opens up. And you can shuffle these into each other. This is going like this. And then you close. You see that in speed it looks like this. And that is how to do a one-handed shuffle.", "title": "How to Do a One-Handed Shuffle | Magic Card Flourishes", "publishedDate": "2013-12-23T05:07:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "79Fh57XWUcs", "description": "One of the competition\u2019s longest-standing marks fell at the feat of Andrew Goudelock on Thursday as the Fenerbahce Ulker scorer became the first man in Euroleague basketball history to sink 10 three-pointers in a single game.", "title": "Andrew Goudelock sets new all-time single game record:10 three-pointers scored", "publishedDate": "2014-11-13T23:02:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "79GK237hyIw", "description": "Psychometric testing is a key stage in the recruitment process for many employers.

When he was a boy in London, England he was in a choir that performed at a Royal Command Performance at the Albert Hall with Princess Elizabeth, Princes Margaret and the Queen Mother in attendance.  He has been in various bands in England and Sydney Australia.  He formed the George London Jazz Trio many decades ago and it played to packed houses at various venues all the time.  \n\nGenial in nature, if you are invited to George's home you are immediately taken to his music room and treated to the latest sounds he has been working on.  He will amaze you with his wizardry on the keyboard.  His keyboards look like they could be the instrument panel on a 747 jet aircraft - buttons, switches and lights everywhere you look.  His arms flail as he prepares the keyboard to play, flipping switches here and there, and pressing button after button until the tone of the keyboard will be just right.  The lights dance over the entire surface of the keyboard and when everything is just right he presses the \"GO\" button.  You are treated to a musical fantasy of songs you have probably heard throughout your life but this time they are being played by the masterful hands of George as he performs a concert just for you. \n\nGeorge has produced many CDs which he sells when he performs at social clubs and RSLs all around the Shoalhaven area.  \"Let Me Entertain You\" is his calling card and for those who attend his performances he will not disappoint.", "title": "George London:  Master Keyboardist", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T01:31:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "79GRtgypddE", "description": "Jokes To Play On Your CoWorkers, Bored At Work, Want To Have Fun At Work, See Some Of The Jokes That You Can Play On Your CoWorkers Or Office Staff.", "title": "Awesome Work office cubicle pranks", "publishedDate": "2012-04-24T14:07:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "79GRxRIH658", "description": "", "title": "TSS Can for Hollywood's Freeride", "publishedDate": "2013-05-02T14:56:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "79GTD0Q3-yI", "description": "http://www.thierryhenry14.net\n\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Here is the reason why.  Most of your time spent is setting things up or getting the ball rolling.  Now this works for a lot of things and not just stickers.\n\nI have noticed that it is much easier and more effective for me to do the same task multiple times versus completing a project from start to end.\n\nSo this is a video project looks like broken down using Chunking. \n\n1. First step is creating the video.  Instead of setting up and creating one video I will create a series of videos.  Normally it is a weeks worth of content.  By doing this I have saved time setting up and most importantly I tend to get into a grove of making the videos. \n\n2.  Next I will edit all the videos in the same session.  Here again save time by using a template for first one and just going through the complete series of videos.\n\n3.  Then on to uploading.  Here again by doing them all together I am able to be more effective in my efforts and saving time over the series of videos.  If I don't want to release them all on the same day I will have them unlisted until I am ready.\n\nYou can see how if you just did one video at a time you wouldn't be as effective.

But the Female alligator will protect its hatchlings for the first year, making it difficult for any bird to approach. Newborn alligators don't need to feed right away, because they still have enough yolk from their egg to provide for the needed nutrition.

A couple of things that bug me a tiny bit are the glass parts that get hot when you're vaping, cus I almost burned myself once, and that you need to stir around the herbs a few times to ensure it's getting evenly vaped. Not a huge deal just a minor annoyance.\n\nThe other thing that bugs me a little bit is having to keep your finger on the end of the mouthpiece to keep the vapor from coming out. I guess I might be spoiled from the Volcano, which has built-in valves in each balloon that automatically keep them sealed, but I'm sure if you vape often you'll get a little annoyed at that too. This requirement is not specific to the Extreme-Q though, most whip style vaporizers work the same way.\n\nOverall this is a pretty cool vape and lots of people love it. If you're mainly looking for a good balloon-style vaporizer I still think the Volcano is worth the extra cost. The V is really in a league of it's own, but for half the price the Extreme-Q does the job pretty well.\n\nVapeRating: 85/100", "title": "Arizer Extreme Q 4.0 Medical Marijuana Herbal Vaporizer Review", "publishedDate": "2013-01-04T21:45:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "79XuhFCKp9A", "description": "Jinn invisible", "title": "Jinn in da house", "publishedDate": "2011-01-03T07:54:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "79Y9aWvoGyM", "description": "The trumpetfish, Aulostomus maculatus, while snorkeling in the crystal clear water of artificial lagoon of Four Season in Bora Bora, Tahiti, French Polynesia", "title": "The trumpetfish, Aulostomus maculatus, while snorkeling in Four Season Bora Bora", "publishedDate": "2014-06-25T10:33:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "79YCWgG7E6A", "description": "Watch as Toni Marine does a test-tank DYNOmite Dynamometer pull after one of their engine rebuilds.", "title": "DYNO-mite Outboard Dynamometer Tank-Test Video", "publishedDate": "2009-06-09T14:33:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "79YDgv_zWA4", "description": "Sonnentanz (Sun Don't Shine Ft.

They're always searching to find that constant connection with the water.\n\n\nWhy Do It:\nSculling in all directions helps you develop a better feel for the water.  Strapless sculling, or using paddles that have limited connection to the hands, helps you feel the press of the scull, while still focusing on having the palms turned in the correct direction.\n\nHow to Do It:\n1.  Start with you feet behind you, on your back.\n2.  Start to scull with your fingertips facing UP.  If you do this right, you should move backward.\n3.  Now simply turn the fingertips DOWN.  If you do this right, you should move forward, toward the feet.\n4.  Remember:  This isn't pulling.  Don't sweep your hands around like this swimmer is doing.\n5.  Sweep back and forth with the hands while keeping the shoulders and elbows as still as possible.\n\nHow to Do It Really Well (the Fine Points):\nRemain completely still with everything except the lower arm.  Keep the body steady, the arms, the head... remain like a rock except for the lower arms and hands.  If you have to kick to keep the feet up, sometimes a pull buoy can help further isolate what you're focusing on.", "title": "All Strokes - Trailing-Hands Sculling", "publishedDate": "2013-08-26T15:54:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "79qArmhlwzA", "description": "Beautiful classic tune with a soaring tonality on pipes not heard in the minor key versions of other instruments.

The gaps are occurring despite the fact that the U.S. and several European security services have developed close intelligence links, with intelligence from both sides of the Atlantic buttressing terror watch lists kept by U.S. officials, such as the no-fly list. \n\nAccording to the Journal, a particular cause for concern among U.S. intelligence officials is a series of anti-terror proposals made last week by British Prime Minister David Cameron, most notably to revoke the passports of British nationals who have traveled to fight for ISIS. The British proposal reportedly has been greeted warily by U.S. counter-terrorism officials, who say that any move to confiscate passports could prevent people who have traveled to Syria and Iraq from speaking to authorities and providing intelligence about what is happening there. \n\nApparently buttressing the U.S. officials' concerns, a report in The Times of London last week suggested that up to 30 British-born ISIS fighters have been disgusted by the militants' brutal tactics and wish to return home, but are fearful of doing so due to the punitive measures advocated by Cameron. \n\nMeanwhile, President Obama is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders Tuesday afternoon to discuss his plan to combat the ISIS threat. Few details of Obama's plan have been revealed ahead of a scheduled Wednesday address to the nation, though the New York Times reported Monday that the White House was in the process of planning a three-phase campaign that some Pentagon officials believe would take at least three years to fully execute. \n\nThe U.S. has already launched close to 150 airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, and The Times reported that the final phase of the campaign would call for the extension of airstrikes into Syria, where ISIS has its home base. \n\nThe Obama administration is also bringing pressure on allies to swing firmly behind action against ISIS. Secretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to travel to to Saudi Arabia and Jordan to meet with Mideast leaders and gauge their level of commitment to a growing worldwide coalition. The Associated Press reported that Kerry pressed a core group of 10 countries  to form a loose coalition to go after last week's NATO summit. Along with the United States, the coalition comprises the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Germany, Canada, Turkey, Italy, Poland and Denmark.\n\n\nTags :\nabc breaking news, bbc, bbc football, bbc iplayer, bbc news, bbc news america, bbc persian, bbc sport, bbc weather, bbc world news, breaking celebrity news, breaking election news, breaking late news, breaking local news, breaking music news, breaking news, breaking news alerts, breaking news canada, breaking news headlines, breaking news in atlanta, breaking news in nigeria, breaking news india, breaking news pensacola florida, breaking news plane crash, breaking news story, breaking sports news, business expensive news home media world, christian world news, cnn, cnn breaking news, cnn money, cnn news, cnn news breaking news, cnn news world, detroit breaking news, global news, headline, headline news, health care technology news, hot latest global news, internet technology news, las vegas breaking news, latest breaking news, latest celebrity news, latest information technology news, latest music news, latest news, latest news headlines, latest news update, latest sports news, live breaking news, local breaking news, local news today, msn breaking news, nbc breaking news, nbc world news, news of the world, news report us world, news today news, news updated daily, solar technology news, sports news today, technology news, the latest news, today news, us news and world, us news and world report, us news and world report magazine, us news and world report web site, us news world report, world news, world news daily, world news headlines", "title": "US efforts to track Islamic extremists reportedly hampered by disputes with Europe", "publishedDate": "2014-09-09T11:30:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "79rHMifBODs", "description": "it's not the official videoclip, I did this for all the fans of Naked City.\n.\nWATCH THIS VIDEOCLIP AND THE OTHERS  IN BETTER QUALITY ON MY SITE\nhttp://www.dariocogliati.com/Video/SfGG.aspx", "title": "Naked City - Jazz Snob Eat Shit", "publishedDate": "2009-10-13T16:57:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "79rQesQ5Llw", "description": "Saitama(Fresh water) Aquarium\u3000\u770c\u55b6\u3055\u3044\u305f\u307e\u6c34\u65cf\u9928\nAquarium Movies  http://sasuaqu.blogspot.jp\n\n\u30b3\u30af\u30c1\u30d0\u30b9        Smallmouth bass\u3000Micropterus dolomieu", "title": "Saitama(Fresh water) Aquarium\u3000\u770c\u55b6\u3055\u3044\u305f\u307e\u6c34\u65cf\u9928\u3000\u30b3\u30af\u30c1\u30d0\u30b9        Smallmouth bass\u3000Micropterus dolomieu", "publishedDate": "2014-03-22T11:13:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "79rSIoI4U5Q", "description": "@bosscoupleent #whynotwednesdays @barsmithphx images by #TheBoyzDoHair #TBDHImages", "title": "WNW   Sada & Whitney", "publishedDate": "2014-04-27T20:05:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "79rSLPsF8XQ", "description": "Coronis Real Estate property listing - 40 Lacebark Street, Northlakes\nFor Sale with Stephen Lamont at Coronis Realty", "title": "Coronis Real Estate - 40 Lacebark Street, Northlakes", "publishedDate": "2014-07-03T04:36:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "79rVNK2XLYI", "description": "If there is a more colorful Celosia, it's hard to imagine how!

Suplia a cualquiera de los marimbistas que hiciera falta en cualquier puesto de la marimba, sin que nadie le hubiera ense\u00f1ado, ya que solamente su herencia, su linaje, su apellido y su vocacion fueron sus maestros.\n\nPara la inauguraci\u00f3n del Ferrocarril de los Altos (\u00fanico en su g\u00e9nero en America Latina en aquella \u00e9poca, 1929), Mingo compuso una melod\u00eda con ese nombre, de tan grande \u00e9xito, que muy pronto fue grabada en Estados Unidos por la marimba Centroamericana. Pieza que a\u00fan es muy solicitada.\n\nEn 1932 Mingo organiz\u00f3 su propio conjunto marimbistico con el nombre de \"Marimba Ideal\", el que fu\u00e9 exclusivo de la recordada Radio Morse (hoy TGQ), donde actuo por 12 a\u00f1os consecutivos. Con el conjunto de la Quinta Zona Militar, viaj\u00f3 por Cuba y los Estados Unidos, cosechando innumerables triunfos al dar a conocer parte de su repertorio.\n\nDomingo Bethancourt fue uno de los m\u00e1s fecundos compositores de m\u00fasica ligera con que cuenta Guatemala. De su prol\u00edfera inspiraci\u00f3n citamos las siguientes melodias que est\u00e1n grabadas por diferentes casas disqueras: \"Callecita de los Alamos\"; \"Silba, zapatero\"; \"Antonieta\"; \"Ver\u00f3nica\"; \"Muchachas genovenses\"; \"Aguacat\u00e1n\"; \"San Francisco Zapotitl\u00e1n\"; \"El tiempo todo lo borra\"; \"Cob\u00e1n\"; \"La Matraquita\"; \"Querido Rinconcito\"; \"Xelaj\u00fa de mis recuerdos\";\"Brisas del Salam\u00e1\";\"El Cacique dormido\"; \"Santiaguito\", etc., etc.\n\nRecibi\u00f3 distintos homenajes, entre otros: el gobierno de Guatemala le otorg\u00f3 la \"Orden del Quetzal\" en el grado de Comendador y la Casa de la Cultura de Quetzaltenango le otorg\u00f3 el \"Bot\u00f3n de Oro\".\n\nDespu\u00e9s de seria enfermedad falleci\u00f3 en su tierra natal el 29 de febrero de 1980.\n\n\nFuente: La M\u00fasica en Guatemala, Algunos Musicos y Compositores, escrito por J.Eduardo T\u00e1nchez.", "title": "Coban - Marimba Chapinlandia", "publishedDate": "2007-10-17T23:51:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "79saShezc7E", "description": "Turn 1 Yeti GG.

One daju hrabrost, snagu i posve\u0107enost da se prate sopstveni ciljevi i snovi. Omogu\u0107avaju razvoj vi\u0161ih nivoa intuicije, samopouzdanja, duhovnosti, kreativnost i u\u017eivanja.\n\nCvetne esencije su te\u010dne, potencirane biljne esencije koje se dobijaju od cvetnog dela biljke. Njihovo dejstvo je jedinstveno po tome sto se odnosi na mentalni i emotivni aspekt zdravlja. Prvih 38 cvetnih esencija je formulisao Britanski lekar Dr. Edward Bach i to tridesetih godina pro\u0161log veka, a sada su nam dostupne esencije i od mnogih drugih biljaka. \n\nObi\u010dno se uzimaju oralno iz korisni\u010dke bo\u010dice koju priprema prakti\u010dar cvetnih esencija. Standardna doza je po 4 kapi 4 puta dnevno do mesec dana koje se direktno nakapaju na jezik. Postoje i drugi na\u010dini uzimanja cvetnih esencija na primer kao sprej ili u obliku kreme ili se mo\u017ee nakapati par kapi u kupku. \n\npoma\u017eu da se osoba oslobodi negativnih uverenja koja postoje na nivou nesvesnog i omogu\u0107avaju pozitivnim kvalitetima, kao \u0161to su ljubav, radost, vera, hrabrost i mnogim drugim da se ispolje u \u017eivotu osobe. Kada negativna uverenja i misli nestanu, ravnote\u017ea i isceljenje nastupaju.\nDanas postoji vi\u0161e vrsta cvetnih esencija, Britanske (Bahove), Francuske, Australijske, Indijske. U Kaliforniji 1979. godine, Patricia Caminski i Richard Katz osnivaju Flower Essences Society (FES) i u sardnji sa svojim timom do danas razvijaju \u00a0jo\u0161 104 cvetne esencije.\n\nOne mogu biti podr\u0161ka svima nama u svakodnevnom \u017eivotu i radu. Kalifornijske cvetne esencije koriste se i za:\nja\u010danje imuniteta\nispoljavanje kreativnosti\nza duhovnost\nza radoholi\u010dare\nza bebe koje neprestano pla\u010du\nza decu koja su usled nekih traumatskih iskustava, zatvorena i povu\u010dena\nza one koji su se suo\u010dili sa velikim gubitkom\nPoma\u017eu svima koji rade terapeutske, medicinske poslove, tj. poslove gde svakodnevno upijaju tu\u0111u energiju. Poma\u017eu u radu sa adolescentima koji ispoljavaju agresivnost, mogu biti podr\u0161ka kod raznih \u017eivotnih dilema, odluka.

Police managed to catch up with Robert C Williams, 42, after he stole $20,650 from a PNC Bank in Maryland, US. CCTV of the robbery shows Williams dropping the stolen cash inside the bank before hastily trying to pick it up and shove it into an upturned umbrella he found on the floor. But the calamities didn't end there, after leaving the scene, Williams drove his getaway vehicle straight over police spikes and when he tried to run, the clumsy thief slipped on ice and cut his head open. He was finally able to get away in his green minivan but not before numerous bank customers called the police. The setbacks ensured police were able to pursue and arrest him a short time later.

Now, we make fun of them, and half the practice they're in watching soap operas or whatever the heck they do. But they're so valuable. I work a lot with a young guy called Chris Sailer, Chris Sailer Kicking, and Chris Rubio's his long snapping coach. The things that they can teach a kicker and a punter and a long snapper are really more than just kicking. There are some great techniques to it.\n\nBut I would say this. You're a kicker, OK. I think some of the most important parts of that is your physical strength, your understanding of your plant foot. Get coached I guess is the best thing to say about specialists. Because most high school coaches don't know enough about it to coach it. That's one of the positions I think more than anything has to have a third party involved like a Chris Sailer or Chris Rubio.\n\nNow, I can see what a good long snapper looks like. I can see that his whole body he's got following through to the punter. His hands are shooting out. I understand that. I understand that the punter has great leg strength. I can see the hang time. I can see the kicker, the ball jumping off his feet. Those things college coaches look for.\n\nBut to be a great kicker, punter, long snapper it's about technique. That will sustain you. Know that college coaches know about as much as high school coaches when it comes to those positions. I would get some help. Be technically sound so that your leg strength, your athleticism, your power, and all those other things will be a plus and help you last a long time in college football and beyond.", "title": "5 Best Kicker / Punter Qualities | Football Recruiting", "publishedDate": "2014-08-30T15:12:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "7A2WOcalvhw", "description": "Nouvelle video Hacker tout les jeux android https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5LB6IFBvPk\nComment d\u00e9placer ses application vers sa carte SD en moins de 5MIN.\nAbonne toi STP !\n1.t\u00e9l\u00e9charger titanium backup  http://adf.ly/pyTlB\n2.Ouvrir l'application et d\u00e9placer l'appli de votre choix\n\nTITANIUM BACKUP n\u00e9cessite le root de votre appareil.\n\nComment d\u00e9placer des application vers la carte sd, deplacer des application vers un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, d\u00e9placer des application sur une tablette, d\u00e9placer des application vers la carte sd, d\u00e9placer des application sur une tablette, d\u00e9placer des application vers la carte sd, comment d\u00e9placer des application vers la carte sd, deplacer des application vers un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, d\u00e9placer des application sur une tablette, d\u00e9placer des application vers la carte sd, d\u00e9placer des application sur une tablette, d\u00e9placer des application vers la carte sd, comment d\u00e9placer des application vers la carte sd, deplacer des application vers un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, d\u00e9placer des application sur une tablette, d\u00e9placer des application vers la carte sd, d\u00e9placer des application sur une tablette, d\u00e9placer des application vers la carte sd, comment d\u00e9placer des application vers la carte sd, deplacer des application vers un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, d\u00e9placer des application sur une tablette, d\u00e9placer des application vers la carte sd, d\u00e9placer des application sur une tablette, d\u00e9placer des application vers la carte sd", "title": "Comment d\u00e9placer ses application vers sa carte SD EN MOINS DE 5MIN!!!", "publishedDate": "2013-07-13T12:25:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "7A2X5-SmKgA", "description": "", "title": "WMI mount Methanol No atomisation.MOV", "publishedDate": "2011-04-24T22:50:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "7A3JNZiGIn4", "description": "An artistic rendition of the ULAB Permanent Campus, prepared by the architects ARC Architectural Consultants.

The family branched out into the retail food business in 1980, operating from a 500-square-foot addition to their home that was outfitted with a chest freezer and a little cash register.\n\nInspired by Albertson's, Olson's and Larry's stores, Boo Han named his store after himself. \"It's not a Korean custom to put the family name on a business, but my father decided to do like the Americans do,\" says his son.\n\nBooHan Market stocks the fiery sauces and other Korean ingredients not commonly found this far north. A brief tour reveals fresh quail eggs, preserved duck eggs, roasted dried laver (seaweed), bamboo leaves, twig-like bracken and sweet-potato stems. At the meat counter, pork neck, beef knee bones and thinly sliced meat for bulgogi or kal-bi are on display.

Versions of the libretto have been performed at the 2011 Ice Factory Festival in New York City (under the direction of Marcy Arlin), CentralTrak Gallery in Dallas in 2012 and an early draft was translated and published by a Republic of Slovenia Public Fund. This is the first time both female characters are being played by the same actress! For tonight, we were particularly focused on experimenting with what Ruth calls emotional vibrato; the performance \"pivot\" point where text, music, movement, and voice intersect to create a heightened, poetic world. Can visual images have musicality? What roots abstract ideas to emotional truth? Can we confound the horizons of east and west, rich and poor, Greek and Turk? Can layers of story radiate like icon paint peeling from the wood in the Mediterranean heat? We have loved living with these questions!

Su padre, Luis Morales era violinista. Adolescente de trece a\u00f1os, e integrante del grupo fundado por su padre, al final de la d\u00e9cada de los '20, el presidente venezolano Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez les contrat\u00f3, para que la agrupaci\u00f3n fuese la orquesta del entorno presidencial. En 1930 la familia Morales regres\u00f3 a Puerto Rico, aunque, a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, con su propia orquesta, Noro Morales volver\u00eda a Venezuela.\n\nCuando fue fundada nuevamente, la agrupaci\u00f3n se estableci\u00f3 en Nueva York en 1935, present\u00e1ndose en el club El Morocco; junto a sus hermanos Jos\u00e9, Humberto e Ismael. Ya en 1938 comenz\u00f3 a adquirir auge y popularidad, y, a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, se consagr\u00f3 con el tema Serenata r\u00edtmica. Al a\u00f1o siguiente Noro Morales alternaba con la orquesta de Bobby Byrne en el Glen Island Casino.\n\nComienzos\nDesde 1940 a 1950, su actividad se desenvolvi\u00f3 casi totalmente en Nueva York, en los escenarios de los clubes La Conga, Stork Club y China Doll, entre otros; a tiempo que alternaba con otras orquestas, como Tito Puente, Bobby Byrne, Jos\u00e9 Fajardo, y otros. Gan\u00f3 as\u00ed fama en la colorida localidad de Harlem, donde surgieron otras figuras de la m\u00fasica popular como Count Basie, Duke Ellington, y otros, que, as\u00ed como Noro Morales se desenvolv\u00edan en clubes nocturnos de esa localidad, tal como el famoso Toreador\",muy frecuentado por m\u00fasicos latinos. En la vocalizaci\u00f3n se escuchaban los cantantes Frank Grillo \"Machito\" ,Tito Rodr\u00edguez, Vicentico Vald\u00e9s y otros. En 1950 la orquesta de Noro Morales estaba integrada as\u00ed: Noro Morales al piano, Doc Severinsen, Johnny Costello y Vince Casta\u00f1eda, trompetas; Adri\u00e1n Tei y Drew Walter, saxo alto; Joe Grimm, saxo tenor; e Irv Butler, saxo bar\u00edtono; Lidio Fuentes, bajo, Ram\u00f3n Rivera, bong\u00f3, Chuck Duchesne, conga; y Moncho Mu\u00f1oz, timbales. Los cantantes eran Tito Rodr\u00edguez, Vicentico Vald\u00e9s, y Pedro \"Pell\u00edn\" Rodr\u00edguez, qui\u00e9n ser\u00eda en a\u00f1os posteriores integrante de El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico.\n\nConsolidaci\u00f3n\nA mitad de la d\u00e9cada de los '50 en adelante, la orquesta efectu\u00f3 constantes giras hacia otros pa\u00edses de Latinoam\u00e9rica para amenizar fiestas bailables, y, as\u00ed, visit\u00f3 muchas veces, en las fiestas de carnaval, y tambi\u00e9n en Navidad y A\u00f1o Nuevo, la ciudad de Maracaibo,al occidente de Venezuela. de tal nombre surgi\u00f3 un nuevo tema: el mambo \"Maracaibo\", que tuvo gran aceptaci\u00f3n, e, incluso Xavier Cugat, lo integr\u00f3 a su repertorio, al igual que otros temas ya conocidos como \"Bim bam bum\" y \"Oye negra\". Esta \u00faltima tambi\u00e9n adoptada por otro cultor de los ritmos del caribe, Edmundo Ros; as\u00ed como el mismo Ronnie Aldrich, qui\u00e9n, en sus versiones a \"dos pianos\", grab\u00f3, de Noro Morales \"Vodoo moon\", incluido en el \u00e1lbum \"All time piano hits\".\n\nLegado\nSu versatilidad en la ejecuci\u00f3n del piano hizo de Noro Morales uno de los m\u00e1s reputados int\u00e9rpretes del instrumento, junto a otros meritorios latinoamericanos del teclado, como D\u00e1maso P\u00e9rez Prado, Francisco Sim\u00f3 Damir\u00f3n, Juan Bruno Tarraza, Armando Or\u00e9fiche y Everardo Ordaz, entre otros pianistas de la Cuenca del Caribe. Su estilo se hizo caracter\u00edstico e inconfundible, por su habilidad en el recorrido del teclado, con originales \"solos\" y \"montunos\", en cuyos fraseos musicales se destacaban indefectiblemente las tonalidades agudas. La m\u00fasica tropical caracteriz\u00f3 su obra: \"Oye negra\", \"Vitamina\", \"El sop\u00f3n\", \"Walter Winchell Rumba\", \"Mambo Coco\", \"Mambo Mono\", \"Vamos ya\", \"O la la\", \"Sha wang ga\", \"Stromboli\", \"Mercedito\", \"Noro's Jump\", \"Serenata r\u00edtmica\", \"Ponce\", \"Maracaibo\", \"Mi guajira\", y \"Mar\u00eda Cervantes\", esta \u00faltima, en homenaje a una eximia pianista cubana, son parte de la herencia cultural que este artista dej\u00f3 a la posteridad.

Drayer later posted the video to the group's YouTube account and the clips have received more than 300,000 views in just three days. \n\nIn the video, Duran is first seen showering an activist with profanity, calling him a \"f***ing dipshit\" and a \"racist f***ing male\". She's then heard saying the illustration of the group's anti-abortion signs were incorrect, arguing that at 12 weeks old, fetuses are only a cluster of cells and do not have hands. \n\nThe video then shows her proceeding to kick over the sign, before smacking the camera in Drayer's hands and calling him a \"f***wit\". \n\nBefore Drayer could call police, Duran is seen charging toward a second sign the group has put on the street and knocking it over. She is also seen telling another activists, \"no uterus, no right to talk about it.\"\n\nTwo policemen on bicycles later arrived at the scene and escorted Duran off a bus she had boarded. They have since leveled the misdemeanor charges of assault and criminal damage against her. Duran is due to appear in court at a later date. \n\nIn response to her angry outburst towards the activists, Duran told reporters that she \"has no regrets.\" She was quoted as saying that \"the First Amendment protects [the activists] from government interference; it doesn't protect them from people just basically telling them they're idiots.\"\n\nDuran's mother, Anna Carter, had reached out to Created Equal to ask them to drop the charges, saying that her daughter cannot filter through her emotions because she is autistic, according to a Fox News report. \n\nDrayer, however, stated in a Facebook post that, \"if she were to evidence true remorse, we might consider dropping the charges. But we want to point her toward the truth of justice so that she can appreciate forgiveness offered by Christ's work.\"\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

In the case of The High Road by The Present Moment, it would read a little something like: This album may cause withdrawl symptoms from the slightly dizzying effects of strobe lights; the dusty, lung-filling scent produced by smoke machines and the general heart-palpitation-inducing atmosphere of night clubs. It's true, I'm a few years past the socially acceptable age of clubbing, but I very nearly grabbed my last pair of these and hit the town after listening to this.\n\n\nHailing from LA, artist Scott Milton has produced an album that, in terms of musical scope, fairly well epitomises that night club scene, the kind where nary a braindead pop hit is heard and music doesn't just add to the ambience, it is the ambience -- and the people are thriving on it.\n\nThe primary forces of The High Road draw on some of the more subversive elements of that scene -- namely dark wave, goth and industrial. Opening with the nicely ominous ARRIVAL, an intro glazed with drone, the tone is set for a slightly jaded, occasionally cynical eye to be cast from the observervational point of a dark corner of the room, while those being observed remain completely oblivious as the beat goes on.\n\nTracks such as No Pieces Fit and the title track itself, The High Road, lean more towards synth numbers with subdued melodies and energetic rhythms, though things do get a little more sinister and occasionally aggresive. From the murky, droning bass in EMILY, to the outright frustration displayed on THE DAMAGE IS LOVED, where the frantic industrial core drives it to the point vehement despair.\nBiografie \nhttp://thepresentmoment.bandcamp.com/\nhttp://www.karkis.com/shop/the-present-moment-the-high-road .\n \nThe Present Moment is Scott Milton\nLive Band:\nSM- Keys/Vocals/Toms\nIsul Kim- Bass/Guitars/Vox\nGspider Drums-Pads\n\n\nVinyl Picture Disc-Cd and Cassette available via DESIRE (France)http://desirerecords.bigcartel.com/\nU.S,A http://www.darkentriesrecords.com/ \n\nThe High Road \n\nElectro-infused gothic new-wave industrial-drone. The Present Moment came out of just that. A moment in time where change was influx and it was a chance to venture into new territories musically. Scott Milton, The Present Moment main man, wanted to start giving birth to the musical ideas inside his head out of the band construct. An ever evolving page where he could start this idea and watch it grows out of intention and into a real living musical organism. For now he choose to create and let the process unfold on its own. \n\n\nTHE TIME IS NOW, THE PRESENT MOMENT.\n\n\nIn the heat of LA under his black hood, Scott Milton, member of bands Catalog and Moodorgan, made a mixture of electro pop music sprinkled with dark glow under the name of The Present Moment.\nWith influences ranging from the electro-glam sound of bands like Visage, Human League, Heaven 17 to the more industrial beats of Nine Inch Nails, COIL, Ministry and Throbbing Gristle with a haze of gothic rock (early Adam & The Ants, Siouxsie & The Banshees, Alien Sex Fiend), The Present Moment is releasing The High Road, his first full length album. Originally released on the US hype label Disaro as a limited edition CDr, The High Road is now out on desire. This very first pressing is out on limited edition CDr, very limited edition real-to-real cassette and unlimited digital downloads. \nThe High Road contains 10 tracks penned and produced by Scott Milton with the help of his longtime friend Phillip Muench (The Rorschach Garden, Synpscape) on the title track and The Damage Is Loved. It also includes two great covers: Candy-O, originally written by Ric Ocasek for The Cars and Season Of The Witch written by the English psychedelic troubadour Donovan.\n \nAlbum Recorded Jan-Mar 2010\nPresent Moment Studios/ L.A\nMastered by Phillip Muench/Germany\nArt direction/Photography: Alexander Binder/Germany\nAll songs written by Scott Milton\nPhillip Muench of Synapscape/ The Rorschach Garden \nSynths/Drum Programming on The High Road/The Damage Is Loved\nDevin Pinter/Merricks Model-Guitar on LOW DEAD\nThankyou to Robert Disaro for backing this project and giving it a proper release on the Disaro label.\nAlexander Binder for his amazing images.\nPhillip Muench for who I wouldnt have been able to finish this without his loyalty and hard work.\nHope you enjoy the record.\nScott\nApril 13th 2010-Echo Park/ L.A\n\nLos Angeles\nE-mail \npresentmomentelectro@yahoo.com", "title": "Mascara & The Present Moment - Stealer (music video)", "publishedDate": "2011-07-27T19:13:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "7B66w-Yv2Qk", "description": "Live CCTV Footage St. Benilde Student Hazing Victim Dragged Out from a Room\nhe Manila Police District (MPD) released images from a CCTV footage showing alleged fraternity members behind the death of Guillo Cesar Servando, a sophomore student of the De La Salle - College of St. Benilde (CSB).\nHigh-resolution screenshots show the alleged frat members dragging the body of a neophyte out of a room.\nPolice investigation revealed that Servando, along with other three CSB students, were picked up at One Archers Place in Taft Avenue, Manila by members of the Alpha Kappa Rho (Akrho) fraternity last Saturday.\nAt around 9:30 p.m. on the same day, the four were brought back to the same condominium.\nCondominium guards initially thought that the four students were drunk as they were not walking steadily, but at around 11 p.m., a Red Cross ambulance arrived to respond to a call for help from the unit.\nWhen the guards called the unit, they learned that one of the students was already dead.\nManila: La Salle student killed in alleged hazing, 3 others hurt \u25cf Guillo Cesar Servando\nLa Salle St. Benilde Hazing Victim Students, Alpha kappa rho hazing.\n\nCCTV FOOTAGE OF CSB HAZING VICTIM\nDE LA SALLE - COLLEGE OF ST.

It's really easy to do. It's a great move, and it's just a nice, quick way to cut the cards. You can do it while you're talking to the spectator, while your explaining a trick, and this is how it's going to look, just like that. You can do it as many times as you can, kind of, fit cards into it.\n\nBasically what happens is, you start with your thumb. Right there, on the back of the deck, right? Closest side to you. You start with your middle finger, right there, on the outer side of the deck. \n\nAnd all your going to do is, you're literally going to kick the top portion of the cards, out a little packet, with your index finger. Your index finger's going to literally just kick them out. As you do that, you're going to take the cards, right there, into this grip. See how my index finger's on top there? \n\nAnd you're just going to literally do that over again. You could do this with just two quick cuts, just like that, or you could do three to four, or you could do three to four.\nJust like so. It's all going to depend on how many cards you kick off each time, but it's a great move.\n\nThere's a couple of nice things you can do with it, then I'll show you in some of these tricks we'll be learning, and if you just give it a little bit of practice, you should be able to pick this one up fairly quickly.\n\nAgain, middle finger right there on top, thumb right there on the back, and all you're going to do is kick the cards one by one, and it's a quick way to cut up a deck.", "title": "How to Do the Swivel Cut or Kick Cut | Coin & Card Magic", "publishedDate": "2013-02-08T21:24:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "7B9VnfaUV6g", "description": "Open eyes is a demo we did whilst creating our new album, we just wanted to share it with you. xx \n\nThe xx\n\nDownload an mp3 here: http://wtrns.fr/25lHbR3PLaVyv0\n\nhttp://xx-xx.co.uk", "title": "The xx - Open Eyes (Demo)", "publishedDate": "2011-12-24T13:07:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "7B9hWi2f3aM", "description": "call toll free at 1855.586.5946 or visit our site at http://1855junkyhouses.com\n\n\n\nIs it time to let go of the house?
