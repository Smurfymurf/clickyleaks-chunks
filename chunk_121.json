He is the first Jesuit to be elected pope.\n\nn a lifetime of teaching and leading priests in Latin America, which has the largest share of the world's Catholics, Bergoglio has shown a keen political sensibility as well as the kind of self-effacing humility that fellow cardinals value highly.\n\nPapal expert Christopher Bellitto told CBSNews.com said he was surprised by Bergoglio's election but noted that the new pope's credibility and simplicity will serve the church well.\n\n\"He looks like he can sit on the park bench with a lot of people along the ideological spectrum - and that I think is critical,\" Bellitto said.\n\nBergoglio is known for modernizing an Argentine church that had been among the most conservative in Latin America.\n\nBergoglio is known to be conservative on spiritual issues. He opposes abortion, same-sex marriage and supports celibacy. However, according to the National Cathedral Reporter's John Allen, \"he's no defender of clerical privilege, or insensitive to pastoral realities.\"\n\nAllen notes that in 2012, the archbishop assailed priests who refused to baptize children born out of wedlock, calling it a form of \"rigorous and hypocritical neo-clericalism.\"\n\nBergoglio has also displayed sympathy for HIV-AIDS victims. According to Allen, in 2001 Bergoglio visited a hospice to kiss the feet of a dozen AIDS patients.\n\nComplete coverage: Change at the Vatican\nBergoglio often rode the bus to work, cooked his own meals and regularly visited the slums that ring Argentina's capital. He considers social outreach, rather than doctrinal battles, to be the essential business of the church.", "title": "Who is the new pope Jorge Bergoglio", "publishedDate": "2013-08-17T14:42:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bl2FZWxjEk", "description": "Secret killstreak in Advanced Warfare!

We thought maybe they were about to be fed or something so we grabbed the camera to try and film it.\n\nWe was very aware the lions were not happy because they were very alert and twitchy, they never took their eyes off what they were looking at but at this time we could not see what was going on.  We saw several rangers drive past at very high speeds in there 4x4 and we soon relised that something was not right.\n\nWe soon noticed people were out their vehicles and smoke was coming out of a family car.\n\nThe family was swiftly picked up and put safe in a rangers 4x4 and their family car was totally engulfed in flames within minutes of them getting out.\n\nThe Rangers chased the lions away from the area of the fire and the fire brigade soon arrived to put the the fire out.\n\nYou could tell the rangers at the scene were very panicked but from what we saw they did an amazing job of securing the area as best they could and making sure the family were safe.\n\nI hope the family involved are safe and soon get another car sorted.", "title": "Car Catches Fire In The Lion's Enclosure At Longleat Safari Park, Wiltshire", "publishedDate": "2014-04-19T21:37:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bzPVMgPPgA", "description": "Cesar Vezzani's rendition of La Donna e Mobile", "title": "Cesar Vezzani: La Donna e Mobile (Comme la Plume au Vent)", "publishedDate": "2011-11-01T01:55:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bzQoXC0RUg", "description": "http:www.CleanMyCarpet.com.

Cardinal Thomas Wolsey was the most important statesman and churchman of the Tudor history period in 16th century England. Cardinal Wolsey  proved to be a faithful servant but displeased the King, Henry VIII, by failing to facilitate the King's divorce from Queen Katherine of Aragon who had been his queen of many years. The reason for seeking the divorce and hence the creation of the Old Mother Hubbard poem was to  enable him to marry Anne Boleyn with whom he was passionately in love. In the Old Mother Hubbard song King Henry was the \"doggie\" and the \"bone\" refers to the divorce (and not money as many believe) The cupboard relates to the Catholic Church although the subsequent divorce arranged by Thomas Cramner resulted in the break with Rome and the formation of the English Protestant church and the demise of Old Mother Hubbard - Cardinal Wolsey.

It has characteristic loud alarm calls which are variously rendered as did he do it or pity to do it leading to colloquial names like the did-he-do-it bird. Usually seen in pairs or small groups not far from water but may form large flocks in the non-breeding season (winter). Red-wattled Lapwings are large waders, about 35 cm long. The wings and back are light brown with a purple sheen, but head and chest and front part of neck are black. Prominently white patch runs between these two colours, from belly and tail, flanking the neck to the sides of crown. Short tail is tipped black. A red fleshy wattle in front of each eye, black-tipped red bill, and the long legs are yellow. In flight, prominent white wing bars formed by the white on the secondary coverts.\n\nRace aigneri is slightly paler and larger than the nominate race and is found in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Indus valley. The nominate race is found all over India. The Sri Lankan race lankae is smaller and dark while atronuchalis the race in north-eastern India and eastern Bangladesh has a white cheek surrounded by black.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

She's been making waves ever since her song Gucci Gucci hit the web last month, which also got her signed to SOny recently as well. \nBut she's essentially kicking off her career with a major dis towards Nicki Minaj. She said in an interview with COmplex magazine, \"No disrespect to [Nicki Minaj] but when it comes to inspiring young women, her message is to be a Barbie-to be plastic, to be fake, to all have blonde hair.\" Nicki fans have attacked Kreayshawn on Twitter,slamming her for her comments, which prompted a new interview with Billboard in which she honors Nicki for being independent and powerful.  Kreayshawn also has people in a tizzy over her usage of the N word. It comes up in Gucci Gucci, and K defends it, saying it's normal practive in her native Oakland, CA.

Some valuable constituents contained in Mullein are Coumarin and Hesperidin, they exhibit many healing abilities. Research indicates some of the uses as analgesic, antihistaminic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant, antiviral, bacteristat, cardio-depressant, estrogenic, fungicide, hypnotic, sedative and pesticide are valid.\n    An infusion is taken internally in the treatment of a wide range of chest complaints and also to treat diarrhea and bleeding of the lungs and bowels. The leaves, root, and the flowers are anodyne, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, antispasmodic, astringent, demulcent, diuretic, emollient, expectorant, nervine, and vulnerary. \n\nFolklore\n    An old superstition existed that witches used lamps and candles provided with wicks of Mullein in their incantations, and another of the plant's many names, 'Hag's Taper', refers to this. Both in Europe and Asia the power of driving away evil spirits was ascribed to the Mullein. Being a sure safeguard against evil spirits and magic, and from the ancient classics, it was this plant which Ulysses took to protect himself against the wiles of Circe.\n\nThe whole plant possess slightly sedative and narcotic properties. The seeds are considered toxic. They have been historically used as a narcotic and also contain saponins.\n\nThe dried leaves are sometimes smoked to relieve the irritation of the respiratory mucus membranes, and the hacking cough of consumption.

However, a significant number of journalists and photographers are finding themselves being harassed and criminalized by increasingly politicized law enforcement officers who overlook the supreme law of Canada time and time again.\n\nJakub Markiewicz was arrested in 2012 when he filmed security guards and police detaining a man at a shopping mall in Burnaby, British Columbia. Jennifer Pawluck was arrested when she took a photo of someone else's graffiti depicting a Montreal police officer in a negative light and posted it on the internet. Paul Pritchard had his footage of police tazering a man to death at Vancouver airport confiscated and had to launch a lawsuit against the police to retrieve the footage which was later used as evidence to demonstrate police impropriety.\n\nCritics say that the Harper government's so called \"tough on crime\" agenda has given many police officers the impression that they are above the law. Such critics say that it is the government's empowerment of the police that is leading to the increased criminalization of journalists and photographers who serve the public interest. \n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO:\nhttp://www.presstv.ir/\nhttp://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/07/31/316499/canada-increases-criminalization-of-media-workers/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/YYCTRUTH\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/Globalization1492\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/westlock420\n\n*Video is for educational purposes only and are in accordance with the Internet Fair Use Act.", "title": "PRESS TV - Canada Increasing Criminalization Of Media Workers", "publishedDate": "2013-07-31T20:09:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "6cdQLPbxcpk", "description": "http://www.essentialtennis.com Here's a quick video of Nadal drilling his backhand during a practice session in Cincinnati.", "title": "Rafael Nadal Backhand Drill in HD Back View", "publishedDate": "2011-08-17T04:21:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "6cdTTP7HTXA", "description": "Ceci est une premi\u00e8re vid\u00e9o depuis mon APN Panasonic TZ5 ...

Banksters love the faith- and fraud-based ability of paper and never tire of dissing currencies based on physical commodities such as gold or silver.\n\nAdopting a gold standard will shut down the printing presses and not allow the financial elite to manipulate the money supply and perpetuate the fractional reserve scam which is a monumental form of embezzlement and thievery.\n\nIt turns out the ISIS scam driving the war machine of the state may also serve the propaganda purposes of the financial elite and the central bankers.\n\nThe terrorists, beheaders and crucifiers are adopting a gold standard. Website affiliated with Islamic State says leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has instructed his followers to start minting coins Islamic State says its leader has ordered that the organisation start minting gold, silver and copper coins for its own currency, the Islamic dinar.\n\nA website affiliated with the militant group said late on Thursday that its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, had instructed his followers to start minting the coins to \u201cchange the tyrannical monetary system\u201d modelled on western economies that had \u201censlaved Muslims\u201d.\n\nThe posting says the order was approved by the group\u2019s shura council, an advisory board.\n\nAfter seizing large swaths of Iraqi and Syrian territory this year, Isis proclaimed a caliphate, or Islamic empire, on lands under its control. The Islamic State (Isis) has recruited an army hundreds of thousands strong, far larger than previous estimates by the CIA, according to a senior Kurdish leader. gold silver copper coin coins \"gold bullion\" \"gold coin\" \"silver coin\" currency commodity \"gold standard\" finance economy money cash \"middle east\" bank banking banker \"bank account\" \"Savings account\" 2014 2015 elite supply mint war ww3 \"world war 3\" system matrix constitution save consumer u.s. bonds \"united states\" america \"wall street\" \"u.s. army\" truth news media entertainment \"u.s. mint\" \"perth mint\" bullion trading \"forex trading\" \"sell gold\" wealth wealthy millionaire society trendy trending price forex \"elite nwo agenda\" jim rogers marc faber gerald celente trends in the news g4t jsnip4 rawdogletard louis farrakhan federal reserve alex jones infowars china russia brics germany vault mexico demand glenn beck coast to coast am msm\n\nHe said the ability of Isis to attack on many widely separated fronts in Iraq and Syria at the same time shows that the number of militant fighters is at least 200,000, seven or eight times bigger than foreign in intelligence estimates of up to 31,500 men.\n\nFuad Hussein, the chief of staff of the Kurdish President Massoud Barzani said in an exclusive interview with The Independent on Sunday that \u201cI am talking about hundreds of thousands of fighters because they are able to mobilise Arab young men in the territory they have taken.\u201d Here\u2019s the extent of the ISIS threat inside Canada: some would-bes were overheard by the \u201cauthorities\u201d discussing knife and gun attacks against U.S. and Canadian targets in Canada. \u201cThe unknowns, those inspired by ISIS but as yet on no radar, add to the worry, helping to make this what U.S. and Canadian officials have said is the most dangerous time since 9/11 for a domestic terror attack.\u201d \n\nLike Iraq\u2019s illusory weapons of mass destruction the media insisted Saddam Hussein planned to use against America, and thus we were compelled to invade and kill 1.5 million Iraqis, the ISIS threat compels our government to bomb targets in Iraq and Syria to stop known unknowns from killing us.

It is difficult to diagnose this with prenatal ultrasound because sonographers are not generally looking for this condition. True knots arise from fetal movements and are more likely to develop during early pregnancy, when relatively more amniotic fluid is present and greater fetal movement occurs. Constriction of a true knot is not common but it may lead to obstruction of the fetal circulation and subsequent intrauterine death. In fact, fetuses with true umbilical knots are at a four-fold increased risk of intrauterine death(Ref#2). It has been reported that true knots are associated with(Ref#1 and #2):\n\u2022Advanced maternal age\n\u2022Multiparity\n\u2022Previous miscarriages\n\u2022Obesity\n\u2022Prolonged gravidity\n\u2022Male fetus\n\u2022Long cord\n\u2022Maternal anemia\n\u2022Maternal chronic hypertension\n\u2022Hydramnios\nPulsed wave Doppler spectral analysis can be used to demonstrate a stenotic effect on the umbilical venous blood flow post-stenosis (Ref#3).

Their growth rate is very slow and they molt once a year, they live very long. Adult G. pulchra can be really huge. They are usually calm, their venom is mild (not as strong as Poecilotheria's venom) and they can use their urticating hairs when they feel endangered.\n\nIn this video you can see handling of calm tarantula. It's very easy to \"control\" this tarantula. They are slower than others and you can handle also big ones. They would barely bite you but you should know them well before you touch them.

The first thing you need to do is start the race under control.  Don't sprint out too fast right away and waste all that valuable energy.  I always tell the runners I coach that they hand out the medals at the finish line, not at the first turn.  You need to run relaxed and fast at the start, not fast and furious.\n\n2.  Know your pace and stick too it in the race.  Let's say your goal time for the 5k is six minute mile pace or around a total time of 18:40.  Don't run the first mile in 5:10!  You will burn out and end up crawling in the rest of the race.  Try and run that first mile under control at around 5:45 at the fastest and then make sure you try and assert yourself later on in the race.  When I look at the mile splits of the best runners, there usually is only a 10 to 15 second difference at the maximum from there first, second, and third mile splits.  If you are out in 5:50, you need to be at least at 6:05 or under for the second mile.  Don't relax on the pace or else your last part of the race will be too slow.\n\n3.  Use the hills to your advantage.  Don't sprint up hills.  You waste too much energy and you don't get much bang for your buck.  Instead, stay steady on the up hill, but once you reach the top while everyone who ran too fast up the hill is sucking wind, pick up the pace again and start passing people.  It is a great strategy and works if you are mentally tough.  Downhills you should run fast and in control, but at the end of the hill, when it flattens out, you need to try and hold onto that quicker pace for as long as you can.  The momentum of the downhill will make it easier to hold onto this pace and you can pass people easily without spending a lot of precious energy.\n\n4.  Know the course.  If you are the leader this helps you from getting lost.  If you are simply following the other runners in front of you, be aware of sharp turns or other obstacles.  Run curves smart by trying to keep as much momentum as you can kind of like a race car driver would take sharp turns.  Start on the outside and cut in towards the flag and then round the corner smoothly and quickly.\n\n5.  Be physically and mentally tough.  You will have to remind yourself often during a race that you can do it.  Running isn't easy, so be prepared to deal with some fatigue.  Tell yourself later in the race.  It's okay that I am tired.  So is everyone else.  Just stick with it and focus on running fast and smooth.  Push yourself all the way to the finish line.\n\nHappy Trails - Coach Tief", "title": "Cross Country Race Strategy", "publishedDate": "2011-09-12T04:08:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "6cvPqYGOnwY", "description": "\"BYBLOS MILANO\" ADV Campaign Fall Winter 2014 2015 by Fashion Channel\n\nYOUTUBE CHANNEL:  http://www.youtube.com/fashionchannel\n\nWEB TV:  http://www.fashionchannel.it/en/web-tv\n\nFACEBOOK:  https://www.facebook.com/fashionchannelmilano\n\nTWITTER:  https://twitter.com/FashionChannelP\n\nPINTEREST:  http://pinterest.com/fashionchannel\n\nINSTAGRAM:  http://instagram.com/fashionchanneltv\n\n\n\nThe best videos, the most exclusive moments of the international runway since 1982 until now, of the most representative fashion weeks of the world.

He graduated in arts and law with distinction from the Punjab University. He was awarded PhD by the Punjab University in 1986 on the thesis Punishments in Islam, their classification and philosophy. He took allegiance at the hand of Sayyidina Tahir Ala-ud-Din al-Qadri al-Gilani who groomed him in the mystic way of life and who is his spiritual benefactor. Among his teachers are included his father Dr Farid-ul-Din Qadri, Mawlana Zia-ud-Din Madani, Mawlana Ahmad Saeed Kazmi, Dr Burhan Ahmad Farooqi, Dr Muhammad bin Alawi, all men of high intellectual calibre and scholarly stature. He has delivered thousands of lectures spanning diverse facets of Islam, its religious, spiritual, historical, moral, legal, political, economic, social and scientific aspects and its comparison with other religions. He also delivers lectures at foreign universities on various intellectual and contemporary issues. He has written numerous books in Urdu, English and Arabic to date. Many of his books have been translated into different languages. His lectures are also broadcast from different TV channels in the Western and Arabian world.\n\nMinhaj-ul-Quran International launched by him is thriving now in more than 80 countries of the world. He also laid the foundation of mass education programme (MEP) in Pakistan, which is the greatest educational plan at the unofficial level. His political party, Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), is playing a vital role in national politics by promoting the tradition of tolerance, principle observance and progressiveness in national political culture. He is a unifying symbol of Muslim world and known as an ambassador of peace and human welfare. His intellectual and social contributions to human progress are internationally acknowledged. American Biographical Institute has pronounced him outstanding man of the 20th century and his name has been included in the Millennium Biographical Dictionary as a distinguished intellectual and thinker of the world. Moreover, he is also included among the 500 most effective leaders at the end of the second millennium as recognition of his original research and services to humanity. He was declared 1998-99 personality by the International Biographical Centre, Cambridge as an acknowledgement of his educational and social contributions. In the recent past it is hard to find an individual who has rendered such unprecedented services in such a short span of time for the improvement of the Islamic community through his intellectual and practical struggle.\n\nDr Qadri is, therefore, not an individual but a tradition. He is not only a sensitive interpreter of Islamic values but also a harbinger of the resplendent future of Islam.", "title": "Happy Birthday to Shaykh ul Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir ul Qadri", "publishedDate": "2009-02-14T12:03:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6d6Z40K_vB0", "description": "HipHop at his best !\nPurchase vinyl and digital records here :\nhttp://www.supafuh.com", "title": "Supafuh | The Vintager x Legacy [INSTRUMENTAL]", "publishedDate": "2012-05-26T12:30:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "6d6duvCqT28", "description": "Me And Bobby MC Gee\nhttp://www.jacoro.nl\nBron: Micke Muster", "title": "Micke Muster --- Me And Bobby MC Gee", "publishedDate": "2013-02-12T20:51:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "6d6qSbN6eJ4", "description": "Well this was pretty fun to make!\nTo save myself some time, I only did the first half of this HUNT since the second half did not have much, but I recommend checking out the original video for the whole thing anyway!\nAs always, I apologize for any mistakes or spelling errors I made in the video.\n\nAll video and audio shown directly belongs to the Rooster Teeth channel.\n\nThe following video and audio shown is from the Rooster Teeth video:\nAchievement HUNT #14 - Jack vs. Ryan\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhIKwQ6qIC4\n\n\n\ncan", "title": "Achievement Hunter Shenanigans: Ryan And The Accent", "publishedDate": "2014-06-15T19:37:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "6d7qtR-gzVM", "description": "", "title": "desprecio  palmenia  pizarro", "publishedDate": "2009-04-24T22:12:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "6d8CctYU8N4", "description": "shia in bahrain attacks the police by swords and steel", "title": "shia in bahrain attacks the police by swords and steel", "publishedDate": "2011-03-18T01:42:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "6d8Cz0w48VY", "description": "", "title": "Mi cala la palpebra!!!!", "publishedDate": "2012-09-07T07:58:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "6d8MIENVtKw", "description": "Congressman Ron Paul warns of a contrived incident to provoke war with Iran, a \"Gulf of Tonkin\" type incident, January 11, 2006.", "title": "Ron Paul - Gulf of Tonkin", "publishedDate": "2007-01-14T22:55:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "6d8OFmNwhw0", "description": "\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e43\u0e08\u0e40\u0e04\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07 HUROM \u0e15\u0e34\u0e14\u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d www.juicerthailand.com \u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d 086-306-3877", "title": "HUROM by JUICERTHAILAND.COM - Wheatgrass Juice", "publishedDate": "2010-01-26T05:30:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "6d8_2qwM1fo", "description": "Just some fun showcasing new vaal gem with my latest build.", "title": "Low life windripper + vaal haste vs plateau map", "publishedDate": "2014-05-02T05:20:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "6d8pyqxDdzY", "description": "credit : club Zy.", "title": "Jupiter's comment for\u300cstylish wave CIRCUIT'14 \u6625\u306e\u5d50\u300d", "publishedDate": "2014-02-22T14:58:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "6d94kBpcUyI", "description": "Guahar Khan suffers a disastrous wardrobe malfunction while on the ramp for a leading designer launch.

The sub was capable of carrying three single stage liquid-propellant ballistic missiles (types vary on different modifications of the subs), with one nuclear warhead and six torpedo tubes, which could use nuclear torpedoes as well.\n\nTwenty-three Golf-class submarines were constructed in the USSR over the years. At least one of them was lost in an incident: in 1968, a Golf II class submarine, the K-129, dived too deep in waters northwest of Hawaii and imploded. The crew of 98 all perished. In July 1974, part of it was recovered by the US in an unprecedented operation dubbed Project Azorian.\n\nBy 1990, all Golf-class submarines were decommissioned. Ten of them were allegedly sold to North Korea in 1993. And now it appears that North Korean engineers have been busy learning Soviet technology for the last 20 years and have got the sub seaworthy again.\n\nhttp://rt.com/news/201603-north-korea-missile-submarine/", "title": "Nuke Threat!

It lets you know on how to use your brain effectively. As we are taught in school different things like Math, Science, History and others; we only learn a few skills on how to feel good and how to develop great relationships.\n\nThere is where NLP will come in. This kind of approach has been created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California in the 1970s. These creators learned that there is a relationship between neurological process, language and behavioral patterns. This connection can be changed specifically to achieve one's goal. Exceptional skills can be created and can even be acquired by anyone through this approach. Neuro Linguistic Programming can even cure problems like phobias, depression, common cold and many others.

Lucier in this Howcast video.\n\n\nSo, how to relieve shoulder pain using some foot reflexology techniques.  Of course, you are going to want to do this shoulder reflex.  So, its on both feet and it just in this area, here.  Just again, both feet.  Actually, I think its really nice to give attention both to plantar, which is the bottom of the foot in this area to go across the sides, doing a pinching and then even coming across through here and doing a little bit of finger-walking.  So, lets do this foot with a little bit of the thumb-walking.  So, the thumb-walking your just moving this joint, just a little bit and pull up a little bit, keeping your pressure consistent and going back and..., so you press down.  I'll do a little bit of a waving gesture with the foot, really supporting it back here with this hand.  I'll wave it towards me and go into the shoulder reflex points.  \n\nAnd, you might feel some kind of like change in tissue texture.  Right here there is a little bit of, you can feel there's a little bit of the change in there.  You can just give it a little more attention.  Most people will have that.  You can walk down, especially if you feel that come from different angles.  From the lateral to the medial, going across, across, like I said, you can thumb-walk down.  You could also pinch the sides.  On this foot, you'd be pinching the sides here.  I'm almost pinching from like this area, here and my thumb, so I'm grabbing it here.  My thumb is here and I'm just kind of pulling away.  Its a little bit of a pinching.  And then, I'll go down a little bit more.  I'm going to continue on that, even though the shoulder reflex kind of ends there, you're going to want to go into the arm as well.  Its a little bit further down.  \n\nAnd again, whenever you feel that change in the tissue texture, it might even sound like its popping a little bit or its a little crunchy matter, its just a change in tissues texture, OK?  And then you can give some attention to the spinal reflex, all through here.  Just start at the top or the bottom and just thumb-walk your way down.  Again, always supporting the foot.  All the way down.  And you'll want to do it bilaterally, so you'll do both feet.  So, and then, you'll just want to end with the solar plexis reflex.  So, taking your thumbs, mid point, right at the diaphragm line, which is right here.  You're just going to lean in and those are the reflexes you would go to for shoulder pain.", "title": "How to Relieve Shoulder Pain | Reflexology", "publishedDate": "2012-07-19T11:27:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "6dM16YODkeY", "description": "Partitive penoplast & etude of abilities\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.chatslang.com/emoticons/shortcuts/twitch", "title": "Niwye hooki, pp&eoa", "publishedDate": "2013-11-26T18:35:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6dM9g-W4XB0", "description": "This is a video I made that shows how to do a remittance from a JP Post ATM for customers who use Lloyds Bank to send money back home from Japan.

Alveolar sacs are the terminal portions of the breathing tube system.  Composed of up to thirty tiny air pouches, or alveoli, they provide a lung a total surface area of about 850 square feet for the exchange of gases.  Alveolar walls, composed of a single layer of cells, and the thin boundaries of capillaries---a barrier only one twenty-five thousandth of an inch thick---are all that separate blood and air.  Exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen across this barrier is completed in only a fraction of a second.  Terminal bronchioles carry air to and from alveolar sacs.  Cells lining bronchiole walls bear cilia---minute hairs whose beating action prevents large dust particles from entering the alveolar sacs.  Macrophages on the inner alveolar surface ingest and destroy dust, soot and other foreign particles.  These cells are the body's main line of defense against airborne bacteria drawn into the lungs.  Connective tissue fibers form a frame around the alveoli and support their delicate walls.  Lymph vessels carry excess tissue fluid away from alveoli.  Pulmonary venules take oxygen-rich blood back to the heart.  Pulmonary arterioles conduct carbon dioxide rich, oxygen depleted blood to the aveoli.  Blood capillaries form a meshwork around the aveoli.  As blood flows through the capillaries its loses carbon dioxide and takes up oxygen. and changes from dark to bright red in color.", "title": "How the Body Works : Microanatomy of the Lungs", "publishedDate": "2007-08-03T20:52:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "6dMOWekACm0", "description": "Guide to installing an aluminum drip cap on an exterior window.", "title": "Aluminum drip cap installation", "publishedDate": "2010-02-19T02:48:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "6dN4SZINT-o", "description": "An apprentice specialising in decorative plasterwork known as pargetting.\n\nNominated for the best craftsmanship by a trainee or apprentice employed on a heritage rescue.\nhttp://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/angel-awards/", "title": "Angel Awards Nominee: Jamie Harper Ptolomey for Finchingfield Guildhall, Essex", "publishedDate": "2014-10-14T13:25:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6dNGY5nVbKE", "description": "I caught a Smooth Trunkfish on Isla Mujeres, MX but could not figure out how to clean it.

Audubon Nature Institute has produced 4 piglets since 2005. \n\nBabirusa means \"Pig deer\" in the native language. Males typically have two sets of tusks, one on the lower jaw and one that grows from the top jaw through the top of the snout towards the head. Wrigley lost his top tusks probably due to an injury when he was young. Babirusa are found mainly on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia Babirusa, though a protected species, are \"threatened\" in the wild due to illegal hunting and habitat loss. Babirusa usually have 1 or two piglets at a time after a gestation of about 5.5 months. Babirusa are omnivores and excellent swimmers. Babirusa are very intelligent and usually very social.\n\nAudubon's babirusa live with a pair of Asian Small-clawed otters.\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://www.auduboninstitute.org/conservation/success-stories/babirusa", "title": "Meet Fig, Audubon's baby babirusa piglet", "publishedDate": "2013-03-22T20:06:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "6dR4tNS7ox4", "description": "Aus dem Album \"An und f\u00fcr sich\"\nAmazon:\nhttp://www.amazon.de/f\u00fcr-sich-Clueso/dp/B004L88M2K\n\niTunes:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/de/album/an-und-fur-sich/id427070610", "title": "Clueso - Du bleibst", "publishedDate": "2011-07-05T09:02:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "6dRfd40FHXQ", "description": "Tamandu\u00e1 bandeira, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Giant anteater,  iurumi, jurumim, tamandu\u00e1-a\u00e7u, tamandu\u00e1-cavalo, papa-formigas-gigante e urso-formigueiro-gigante, Fauna brasiliera, Mato Grosso do Sul,", "title": "Tamandu\u00e1 bandeira, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Giant anteater,", "publishedDate": "2014-08-05T19:14:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "6dRuGwS1gWU", "description": "Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\nSubscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\nLike us on FACEBOOK: http://goo.gl/dHs73\nThe Book Thief Official International Trailer (2013) - Geoffrey Rush Movie HD\n\nWhile subjected to the horrors of WWII Germany, young Liesel finds solace by stealing books and sharing them with others.

The center was started in 1993 by the Pandrillus Foundation, a conservation NGO, and the Government of Cameroon.

So far, various methods have been adopted to capture the movements of pubic symphysis with a focus on the non-injured anatomy. However, the existing biomechanical models, simulating either one-leg stance [Kraus, 1998] or symmetrical loading on both legs [Kim, 1999; Pohlemann, 1992; Varga, 1995], differ from the alternating physiological load during the gait. The aim of this study was to develop a new biomechanical testing model with two-leg alternate pelvic loading in order to measure movements at the pubic symphysis closer to reality.\n\nThe study was presented at European Society of Biomechanics Congress in Lisbon, 2012.

The earliest civilizations in the region descended from the Zagros foothills, where they developed agriculture and animal husbandry, and established the first urban cultures in the Tigris-Euphrates basin in present day Iraq. The earliest urban peoples in what is today Iranian territory were the Elamites in the extreme southwest region of Khuzestan. The arrival of the Aryan peoples\u2014Medes and Persians\u2014 on the Iranian plateau in the first millennium B.C.E. marked the beginning of the Iranian civilization, rising to the heights of the great Achaemenid Empire consolidated by Cyrus the Great in 550 B.C.E. Under the rulers Darius the Great and Xerxes, the Achaemenid rulers extended their empire from northern India to Egypt.\nDown to the present, one pattern has repeated again and again in Iranian civilization: the conquerors of Iranian territory are eventually themselves conquered by Iranian culture. In a word, they become Persianized.\n\nArt\nIran has one of the richest art heritages in world history and encompasses many disciplines including architecture, painting, weaving, pottery, calligraphy, metalworking and stonemasonry. There is also a very vibrant Iranian modern and contemporary art scene.\nIranian art has gone through numerous phases of evolution. The unique aesthetics of Iran is evident from the Achaemenid reliefs in Persepolis to the mosaic paintings of Bishapur. \n\nThere are several languages spoken in different parts of Iran. The predominant language and national language is Farsi  Persian, which is spoken across the country\n\nReligion in Iran \nZoroastrianism was the national faith of Iran for more than a millennium before the Arab conquest. It has had an immense influence on Iranian philosophy, culture and art after the people of Iran converted to Islam\nFollowers of the Baha'i faith comprise the largest non-Muslim minority in Iran.  Most of the Baha'i are of Persian descent, although there seem to be many among the Azerbaijani and Kurdish people. The Baha'i are severely persecuted\nPersian Rugs\n\nIn Iran, Persian Rugs have always been a vital part of the Persian culture\n\nThe Persian Garden was designed as a reflection of paradise on earth; the word \"garden\" itself coming from Persian roots. The special place of the garden in the Iranian heart can be seen in their architecture, in the ruins of Iran, and in their paintings\nCuisine:\nCuisine in Iran is considered to be one of the most ancient forms of cuisine around the world. Bread is arguably the most important food in Iran, with a large variety of different bread, some of the most popular of which include: nan and hamir, which are baked in large clay ovens (also called \"tenurs\"). In Iranian cuisine, there are many dishes that are made from dairy products. \n\nNowr\u016bz ( \u0646\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0632, IPA: [nou\u02c8\u027eu\u02d0z], \"New Day\", originally \"New Light\") is the name of the New Year in Iranian calendars and the corresponding traditional celebrations. Nowruz is also widely referred to as the Persian New Year. \n\nThe Haft S\u012bn items are: * sabzeh - wheat, barley or lentil sprouts growing in a dish - symbolizing rebirth * samanu - a sweet pudding made from wheat germ - symbolizing affluence * senjed - the dried fruit of the oleaster tree - symbolizing love * s\u012br - garlic - symbolizing medicine * s\u012bb - apples - symbolizing beauty and health * somaq - sumac berries - symbolizing (the color of) sunrise * serkeh - vinegar - symbolizing age and patience.\n\n\n\nRabbits Born in Custody of San Diego County Department of Animal Services (SPCA Pet Killers & Animal Abusers) starved to death, and California spent over $100,000 to cover up their officer's crime, In Charge Lieutenant Lt.

Wada-Katsumata et al. (p. 972; see the cover) show that this aversion is a result of changes in the peripheral gustatory system, whereby glucose, as well as \"sweet\" receptors, stimulated an aversive bitter compound receptor. \n\nAbstract\nIn response to the anthropogenic assault of toxic baits, populations of the German cockroach have rapidly evolved an adaptive behavioral aversion to glucose (a phagostimulant component of baits). We hypothesized that changes in the peripheral gustatory system are responsible for glucose aversion. In both wild-type and glucose-averse (GA) cockroaches, d-fructose and d-glucose stimulated sugar--gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), whereas the deterrent caffeine stimulated bitter-GRNs. In contrast, in GA cockroaches, d-glucose also stimulated bitter-GRNs and suppressed the responses of sugar-GRNs. Thus, d-glucose is processed as both a phagostimulant and deterrent in GA cockroaches, and this newly acquired peripheral taste sensitivity underlies glucose aversion in multiple GA populations. The rapid emergence of this highly adaptive behavior underscores the plasticity of the sensory system to adapt to rapid environmental change.", "title": "Emergence of an Adaptive Behavior in Cockroaches", "publishedDate": "2013-05-26T20:21:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "6deGPXm71c4", "description": "Sarita Devi Laishram  Crying And Refuge Medal Sarita Devi Boxer crying When Loses Controversial Boxing Semifinal, Husband Loses Cool [Unfair Decision]\nWhat exactly happened? How Sarita Devi refused her boxing bronze medal\nWhile there was speculation that Sarita would not come for the medal ceremony, the boxer made her way into the arena a day later but refused to wear the medal - eventually giving it away to Park who was booed by Indian fans. Indian boxer Sarita Devi broke down on the podium during the Asian Games medal ceremony for the lightweight 57-60 kg category today, refusing to wear the bronze medal awarded to her around her neck. She accepted the medal in her hand and wiped her tears holding it, before handing it to silver medalist Ji Na Park of host South Korea, who had defeated her on Tuesday.\nThe 32-year-old later said she would continue to compete as she wants to set an example for future boxers, but \"this is not acceptable.\"\nThe judges's decision to award the semifinal clash to Ji Na Park on points had left Sarita standing stunned in the middle of the ring in disbelief on Tuesday. Sarita and Park had exchanged heavy blows through the first two rounds, but the Indian was clearly the more powerful in the remaining two, with even local fans silenced by her onslaughts. (Bout was fixed: Sarita's husband cries foul)\nThe final decision in the bout - with two judges ruling against Sarita - was booed by fans. The Indian bench looked angry as Sarita had seemed the better puncher and scored repeatedly in the crucial third round with straight punches on Jina's face.\n\n\nSarita Devi Refuse Medal | Boxer Sarita Devi Refuses to Wear Asian Games | VIDEO\nSarita Devi Refuse Medal | Boxer Sarita Devi Refuses to Wear Asian Games | VIDEO\nSarita Devi Refuse Medal | Boxer Sarita Devi Refuses to Wear Asian Games | VIDEO\nSarita Devi Refuse Medal | Boxer Sarita Devi Refuses to Wear Asian Games | VIDEO\nSarita Devi Refuse Medal | Boxer Sarita Devi Refuses to Wear Asian Games | VIDEO\nSarita Devi\nSarita Devi\nSarita Devi\nSarita Devi\nSarita Devi\n\n\nTAGS:\nAsian Games 2014 Day 12 Live Updates\nAsian Games: Sarita Devi refuses to wear her bronze medal .\nSarita Devi Refuses to Wear Asian Games Bronze\nBoxer Sarita Devi Refuses to Wear Asian Games Bronze\nAsian Games Day 12 Live: Mary Kom wins gold, Sarita\nAsian Games ###Mary Kom punches in the Gold\nWatching live as Sarita Devi refuses to wear the Bronze ...\nAsian Games 2014\nGagan Narang happy with bronze, says age on his side\nAsian Games 2014 Day 12 Live: MC Mary Kom punches first\nAsian Games 2014 Day 12 Live Updates - Sports - NDTV.com\nAsian Games: Sarita Devi refuses to wear her bronze med\nAsian Games Day 12 Live: Mary Kom wins gold, Sarita\nSarita Devi Refuses to Wear Asian Games Bronze, Cries on\nMary Kom wins Asian Games gold in boxing - Got News Wire\nAsian Games: Sarita Devi refuses to wear her bronze medal .\nAsian Games LIVE: Gowda bags silver; Mary Kom, men's\nAsian Games 2014 Day 11: Vikas Gowda clinches silver in ..\nSarita Devi refuses bronze over feeling 'cheated' of final spo\nSarita Devi Refuses to Wear Asian Games Bronze ... - Spo\nAsian Games ###Mary Kom punches in the Gold - Page 55\nLive Blog: Incheon Asian Games 2014, Day 11\nTwitter Trends in New Delhi, India - Trendsmap\nGreater Jammu - Latest Sports News\nAsian Games Day 12 Live: Mary Kom wins gold, Sarita\n2014 Asian Games - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nScuffles, protest over Asian Games boxing ... - AFP.com\nSilver siblings: Laishram Sarita Devi, Laishram Devendro\nAsian Games: Sarita Devi loses controversial bout, settles\nMedal - WASALive\nBoxer Sarita Devi refuses to accept her bronze medal at\nLIVE! - Rediff.com\nAsian Games: Gowda bags silver, Sarita forced to settle for\nAsian Games: Day 11 of competition - insidethegames.biz\nLatest Sports News: IPL News, Cricket India, Live ... - Mid Day\nAsian Games 2014 Boxing: L Sarita Devi suffers\nAsian Games 2014 Boxing: L Sarita Devi suffers\nGoogle News\nChennai - The Hindu\nAsian Games: Mary Kom in final, Sarita Devi robbed off win .\nNews 'Rigging' takes ring: Sarita Devi cries foul after\n@kushanmitra : Watching live as Sarita Devi refuses to wea\nBoxer Sarita settles for bronze despite commanding ..\nAsian Games: Gowda bags silver, Sarita forced to settle for ...\nThe Pandora's box - Mumbai Mirror\nVijender Singh becomes the world number one\nThe Pandora's box - Mumbai Mirror\nVijender Singh becomes the world number one\nPTI-Press Trust of India\nWorld News Asia India Sport Boxing - NewsNow ...\nmary kom, akhil kumar back in boxing squad for asian games\nThe Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Sport\nMary Kom leads women boxers charge into medal round\nLatest online breaking news in hindi | online current news in .\nEntire Media under threat in KCR rule Politics\nIndia boxers look to regain lost pride in Incheon,why Sarita cry", "title": "What exactly happened?

All times I have enjoy'd\nGreatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those\nThat loved me, and alone; on shore, and when\nThro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades\nVext the dim sea. I am become a name;\nFor always roaming with a hungry heart\nMuch have I seen and known,-- cities of men\nAnd manners, climates, councils, governments,\nMyself not least, but honor'd of them all,--\nAnd drunk delight of battle with my peers,\nFar on the ringing plains of windy Troy.\nI am a part of all that I have met;\nYet all experience is an arch wherethro'\nGleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades\nFor ever and for ever when I move.\nHow dull it is to pause, to make an end,\nTo rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!\nAs tho' to breathe were life! Life piled on life\nWere all too little, and of one to me\nLittle remains; but every hour is saved\nFrom that eternal silence, something more,\nA bringer of new things; and vile it were\nFor some three suns to store and hoard myself,\nAnd this gray spirit yearning in desire\nTo follow knowledge like a sinking star,\nBeyond the utmost bound of human thought.\n\n**no audio this verse**\nThis is my son, mine own Telemachus,\nto whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,--\nWell-loved of me, discerning to fulfill\nThis labor, by slow prudence to make mild\nA rugged people, and thro' soft degrees\nSubdue them to the useful and the good.\nMost blameless is he, centred in the sphere\nOf common duties, decent not to fail\nIn offices of tenderness, and pay\nMeet adoration to my household gods,\nWhen I am gone. He works his work, I mine.\n\n** audio restarts here**\nThere lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;\nThere gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,\nSouls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me,--\nThat ever with a frolic welcome took\nThe thunder and the sunshine, and opposed\nFree hearts, free foreheads,-- you and I are old;\nOld age hath yet his honor and his toil.\nDeath closes all; but something ere the end,\nSome work of noble note, may yet be done,\nNot unbecoming men that strove with Gods.\nThe lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;\nThe long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep\nMoans round with many voices. Come, my friends.\n'T is not too late to seek a newer world.\nPush off, and sitting well in order smite\nThe sounding furrows; for my purpose holds\nTo sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\nOf all the western stars, until I die.\nIt may be that the gulfs will wash us down;\nIt may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\nAnd see the great Achilles, whom we knew.\nTho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'\nWe are not now that strength which in old days\nMoved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,--\nOne equal temper of heroic hearts,\nMade weak by time and fate, but strong in will\nTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\n\nAudio created by Robert Nichol AudioProductions all rights reserved rnaudioproductions for http://www.ipodity.com/\nhttp://www.allcast.co.uk/", "title": "ULYSSES'  by Alfred Lord Tennyson", "publishedDate": "2013-01-28T00:23:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "6dq2qBaYRj0", "description": "via YouTube Opptak", "title": "De Top Morsomste Videoklippene siste m\u00e5ned", "publishedDate": "2014-10-10T19:05:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "6dqG05wkOFM", "description": "Jason Kidd threads the needle to serve up Dirk Nowitzki on the backdoor cut.

Today, caries remain one of the most common diseases throughout the world. Cariology is the study of dental caries.\n\nDepending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure.

A vicious darkspawn attack leaves Lothering in ruins, forcing the Hawke clan to seek safe passage to Kirkwall. \nBut Kirkwall itself is not as peaceful and safe as it seems. The ruling faction of Kirkwall, the Templar Order, has become excessively brutal and corrupt in their governing style. This obviously does not sit well with the citizens of Kirkwall, especially the mage population who the Templars seek to control. \n\nAfter paying off family debts and finally being allowed into the city, Hawke takes on various odd jobs until happening across a massive pile of treasure in the Deep Roads, but Hawke\u2019s fortunes don\u2019t last for long. Relations with a foreign military force known as the Qunari reach the boiling point and Hawke is catapulted into the middle of Kirkwall politics. \n\nNow Hawke must deal with the hostile Qunari, manage the increasingly volatile relationship between the Mages and Templars, and handle the fragile political climate of Kirkwall without destroying the entire city.

An introspective soundtrack to everyday life. when you're down at the bottom, frustration and anger take over. But there is always hope for a better tomorrow. These are the kind of emotions people deal with everyday.\" Forged from the ashes of other local New Jersey bands, guitarist Mike Koenig and drummer L.j. Gravine first began to write in early 2001. Dave Neabore, bassist from such notable bands as Dog Eat Dog and Mucky Pup, soon came on board to strengthen and polish their ideas. After months of failed auditions and false starts, the trio stumbled upon an unknown, unproven, and somewhat reluctant singer, Jeff Dixon. \n\nWith his powerful voice, and his dark lyrics and infectious choruses, the puzzle was finally complete, and LowBuz was born. The band immediately took to the studio and completed their debut self-titled EP. With music ranging from heavy and loud, to moody and melodic, LowBuz has a unique sound all its own.\n\nLowBuz is a hard rock band from New Jersey. If you're a fan of crunching guitar, and infectious melodies, then LowBuz may be for you. LowBuz has seen much success on college and internet radio and has been winning fans over every show they play with their high engery set. LowBuz also had a song placed in the Atari/Moonbyte studio video game Crash Day. Now with 3 Ep's and to many shows to count under their belt, LowBuz has entered their home bass Crystal Studios to write and record their first full length record due in the fall.", "title": "LowBuz - On the ledge", "publishedDate": "2008-02-02T15:16:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "6e-s9c35igU", "description": "Richey explains two models for corporate expansion:  vertical and horizontal integration", "title": "Vertical vs. Horizontal Integration", "publishedDate": "2013-02-15T21:22:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "6e0-iERyMDE", "description": "Troubled Teresa & Joe Giudice drop daughters off at school... as Andy Cohen admits he 'was basically crying' for her during Sunday's RHONJ reunion special \n\nTroubled reality TV couple Joe & Teresa Giudice put on a brave face as they dropped their daughters off at school in New Jesrsey on Friday.\n\nThe grinning 42-year-old donned a golden baseball cap over her made-up face and stayed comfy in her fuchsia velor tracksuit and Uggs.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey star will begin her 15-month sentence in federal prison on January 5 for the bankrupt couple's 41 counts of fraud.\n\nTeresa's 42-year-old high school sweetheart - who's been sentenced to 41 month in prison and faces possible deportation to Italy - wore a green puffer coat over navy Adidas track-pants.\n\nOn Thursday, the Giudices shared snaps of their youngest, five-year-old Audriana, dressed in a 1950s poodle skirt for Halloween.\n\nThe New York Times best-selling author raised eyebrows after reportedly dropping $10,000 on their 13-year-old daughter Gia's scantily-clad music video with her girl group 3KT (three carat diamonds). \n\nThe racy video - a cover of Britney Spears' Circus - premiered on Halloween and Giudice allegedly considers her teenager's music endeavor a welcome distraction.\n\n'She wants Gia to have an activity to distract her,' a source told Us Weekly.

Scientists have developed artificial tissue from the heart, liver and lungs, but creating a synthetic network of blood vessels to support these organs has been a challenge.\n\nScientists from the Universities of Sydney, Harvard, Stanford and MIT have been working together to overcome this challenge.\n\nNow, the researchers have created artificial blood vessels in a lab using 3D-printing methods. The bioprinted structures could be used for transplants or for testing new drug.\n\nThis new study is published online in the journal \"Lab on a Chip\".\n\nThe senior researcher from Boston hospital doctor \"Ali Khademhosseini\" is saying that, they are addressing the challenge of creating artificial blood vessels, by offering a unique strategy for vascularization of hydrogel constructs that combine advances in 3D bio-printing technology and bio-materials.\n\nThe researchers first used a 3D bioprinter to make an agarose fiber template to serve as the mold for the blood vessels. Agarose is the naturally derived sugar-based molecule.  They then covered the mold with a gelatin-like substance called hydrogel, forming a cast over the mold which was then reinforced via photocrosslinks.\n\n\"Our approach involves the printing of agarose fibers that become the blood vessel channels. But what is unique about our approach is that the fiber templates we printed are strong enough that we can physically remove them to make the channels,\" said the researcher Khademhosseini. \"This prevents having to dissolve these template layers, which may not be so good for the cells that are entrapped in the surrounding gel.\"\n\nKhademhosseini and his team were able to construct microchannel networks exhibiting various architectural features. They were also able to successfully embed these functional and perfusable microchannels inside a wide range of commonly used hydrogels.\n\nIn the future, 3D printing technology may be used to develop transplantable tissues customized to each patient's needs, or be used outside the body to develop drugs that are safe and effective.\n\nThis new method of printing blood vessels has its limitations. For example, they can't print very small blood vessels, like capillaries, because the materials aren't strong enough.\n\nAnother challenge is that the current printing method requires an opening to remove the template structure.\n\nThe researchers are working on improving the resolution of their bioprinting method and the materials they use, as well as testing the 3D-printed structures with living cells, and ultimately in living animals.\n\nSource: http://www.brighamandwomens.org/about_bwh/publicaffairs/news/pressreleases/PressRelease.aspx?sub=0&PageID=1781\n\nAnd, watch News Video about 3D printed hydrogel \"bio-bots\" powered by muscle cells and controlled with electrical pulses  at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6SUbHn4yg4\n\nWatch News about Self-powered Cardiac Pacemaker which avoids additional surgeries at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPBnULoT-T4\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel at http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=qualitypointtech\n\nSee more Technology News at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK2ccNIJVPpB_XqWWq_oaZGIDzmKiSkYc", "title": "3D-printing for making artificial Blood vessels", "publishedDate": "2014-07-05T10:08:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "6exndcCNZww", "description": "FLYWAY OUTDOORS", "title": "FLYWAY OUTDOORS", "publishedDate": "2012-09-16T00:15:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ey-uzxIBWM", "description": "", "title": "II Decanter Wine Day - Mar\u00edlia/SP", "publishedDate": "2013-05-16T14:18:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ezP3lSJITU", "description": "Les excuses pour justifier le d\u00e9laissement de la lecture et de la m\u00e9morisation du Qur'an en terre de Kufr!!!

MESO-1, BEAS-2B and differentiated THP-1 cells actively endocytosed MWCNTs, resulting in cytotoxicity with lysosomal injury. However, cytotoxicity did not occur in IMR-32 or undifferentiated THP-1 cells. Both differentiated and undifferentiated THP-1 cells exhibited an inflammatory response. Carbon blacks were endocytosed by the same cell types without lysosomal damage and caused cytokine secretion, but they did not cause cytotoxicity. These results indicate that the cytotoxicity of MWCNTs requires not only cellular uptake but also lysosomal injury. Furthermore, it seems that membrane permeability or cytokine secretion without cytotoxicity results from several active mechanisms. Clarification of the cellular recognition mechanism for MWCNTs is important for developing safer MWCNTs.", "title": "Time-lapse confocal imaging - Supplementary video S3: 26689", "publishedDate": "2011-11-16T01:52:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "6f6cqS8ZTqg", "description": "The first videoclip from Superego.\nAlbum: Heavy-Pop\nTrack: Ecstasy\nYear: 2011\n\nAlso available on MTV Hungary!\n\nD.O.P. / VFX : M\u00e1t\u00e9 Moln\u00e1r (http://www.youtube.com/user/molnarmate)\n\nLyrics:\n\nthose days went away \nbut the smile\nnever fades on my face\n\na pill killing them all\nmade the fears\ngo away\n\nstars would jump off your skin\nand the dots, glow with\nthe light of speed \n\na pill killing them all\nmade the fears\ngo away\n\nyou're the one i want\nat the end of the day\nevery time i think \nwhen i want to stray\n\nforces me to say, it forces me to say \n\nlight in our way \ni was a fool\nas the queue for the entrance started to shrink\n\nyou're my ecstasy\n\nyou're the one i want\nat the end of the day\nevery time i think \nwhen i want to stray\n\nforces me to say, it forces me to say \n\nyou're the one i want\nat the end of the day\nevery time i think \nwhen i want to stray\n\nforces me to say, it forces me to say", "title": "Superego - Ecstasy Official Video (HD)", "publishedDate": "2011-08-24T21:02:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "6f6dNo9mESY", "description": "N\u00e1hodn\u011b nalezen\u00e9 sklen\u011bn\u00e9 postavi\u010dky kter\u00e9 se projevily jako m\u00edrn\u011b radioaktivn\u00ed a nejsp\u00ed\u0161e barven\u00e9 Uranem.

No clue why I said bullhead. Musta been tired or something lol\n\nGoldfish (Pond Size)\nGoldfish are a NORTHERN FRESH WATER FISH which can also survive in tropical areas just as well as it can extremely cold environments. The goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is still one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a dark-gray/olive/brown carp native to east Asia (first domesticated in China) that was introduced to Europe in the late 17th century. The mutation that gave rise to the goldfish is also known from other cyprinid species, such as common carp and tench. Selective breeding over centuries has produced several color variations, some of them far removed from the \"golden\" color of the originally domesticated fish. There are also different body shapes, fin and eye configurations. Some extreme versions of the goldfish do need to be kept in an aquarium\u2014they are much less hardy than varieties closer to the \"wild\" original. However, some variations are hardier, such as the Shubunkin. The main varieties are Common Goldfish, Black Moor, Bubble Eye, Celestial Eye Goldfish, Comet-Tailed Goldfish, Fantail, Lionhead, Oranda, Pearlscale, Pompoms, Ryukin, Shubunkins, Demekin, Ranchu, Panda Moor & Veiltail. Ours are somewhere between Common and Fantail -- with large \"forked\" tails, flowing fins and an array of various colors. Goldfish do a great job cleaning up a tank but they produce a high level of PH so you need either a really good filter and / or constant water changes -- especially if you're going to have these in a tank.\n\nConvict Chichlids (Pond Sized)\nThe Convict cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) is a species of fish from the family Cichlidae, native to Central America, also known as the zebra cichlid. Convict cichlids are popular aquarium fish and have also been the subject of numerous studies on fish behaviour. In natural habitats, the species feeds on crustaceans, small fish, insects, various worms, plants and algae. In 2007, the species was moved from the genus Archocentrus to a new genus, Amatitlania based on a study of Archocentus species by Juan Schmitter-Soto. However, a 2008 study led by Oldrich Rican has suggested that all the species in Cryptoheros and Amatitlania, including Amatitlania nigrofasciata, should be moved into the genus Hypsophrys. A number of synonyms exist for this species including: Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, Cryptoheros nigrofasciatus and Heros nigrofasciatus. Convict cichlids are endemic to the lakes and streams of Central America. In particular, the species occurs along the eastern coast of Central America from Guatemala to Costa Rica, and on the western coast from Honduras to Panama. Convict cichlids prefer moving water, and are most frequently found in habitats with cover in the form of rocks or sunken branches. Convict cichlids are relatively tolerant of cool water, an ability which has allowed the species to colonise volcanic lakes at elevations of 1500 m (4920 feet). At four natural habitats of the convict cichlid in Costa Rica, the pH was found to range from 6.6 - 7.8, while alkalinity ranged from 63 to 77 ppm CaCO3. The daily water temperature ranged from 26-29 \u00b0C (79-84 \u00b0F). The species also occurs outside its natural range in Australia: in the warm effluent of power stations in Victoria, and in tropical Queensland. In addition to Australia, the species has been introduced to R\u00e9union, Japan, Mexico, and the USA. Convict cichlids are easily maintained and bred in aquariums. The aquarium should be decorated to mimic the natural environment and should include rocks and artificial caves for breeding. The species is an unfussy omnivore and most types of prepared fish foods are readily accepted. The species will also consume aquarium plants. Convict Cichlids are aggressively territorial during breeding and pairs are best kept alone in suitably sized aquariums. It has been suggested that brood care is reduced in aquarium strains. Due to the tendency of the species to dig, external filtration is recommended over undergravel filter systems. The relatively small size of this species, along with ease of keeping and breeding, make the convict an ideal cichlid for beginners and advanced aquarists alike interested in observing pair bonds and brood care in the aquarium. In very large environments, these fish tend to grow rather large, their body and fin structures become more elaborate and their gray-ish color turns into more of a neon purplish-blue. When understanding the psychology of these fish, they can be made to co-exist with things such as guppies, sword tails and other fish that they would normally hunt down and kill. Doing this is not recommended unless you already know what the hell you're doing :)", "title": "Pondscape.us - All Sorts Of Crap Dat Dun Normally Mix - 2007", "publishedDate": "2008-12-24T01:43:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "6f7YnKlCvdA", "description": "", "title": "asembly fix", "publishedDate": "2013-08-16T04:04:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6f7_hNefqB0", "description": "Information on the field included in Nessus reports that indicates if an exploit is available for a particular vulnerability or not.", "title": "Exploit Availability Flag in Nessus", "publishedDate": "2010-10-19T18:47:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "6f7unlQbTUo", "description": "ICIS produces price reports on the global phenol market on a region by region basis.

This is about 50% pieces my parents bought me as a kid mixed with 50% recently purchased bulk Lego for my boys. We do have some kits but I wanted them to have a decent amount of pieces to be creative with that weren't tied to any instructions. Our oldest has really taken to them.  \n\nThrough research, trail and error I learned I won't spend more than about $5 a pound on bulk generic Lego and only up to $10 a pound for specific pieces or collections I wanted for them. I recommend just buying a large collection someone is selling instead of small bulk lots if you're looking to get your kids started early.  \n\nThe filter plates are home made and I want to give credit to my student Kegan Passmanter who helped me develop and make them. He's a sharp kid and oddly enough his grandfather worked for Lego. \n\nWe found they work best if you sort out pieces while you let the smaller pieces fall through and then repeat with the smaller plates.  We do this process as needed when we have a mess on our hands. So we always have a few bulk bins hanging around sorted out by size only. We pick through them as needed to build or sort, whatever we are feeling.\n\nSort by element shape and size over color. We tried color and we found you need less bins and it's easier to find pieces when they are by element not by color. I hope these ideas help you and you get to spend more time building and playing with your kids than cleaning and sorting.\n\nCheck this video out too for more great advice on sorting bulk out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uvHC6TZ2c", "title": "Lego Storage, Sorting & Organization", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T13:49:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "6f8ouETQfdM", "description": "Medicaid is the key source of health care coverage for low income families, disabled and poor, elderly South Carolinians.

For a trained attacker, this technique would never work. Therefore there is not reason to teach a technique that sometimes will work and sometimes would not work. It defeats the purpose of teaching Krav Maga and it is unqualified as a Krav Maga technique.\n\nBoaz Aviram is one of the only Krav Maga experts who were there at the very beginning, and holds the secrets of this most effective Hand-to-Hand fighting technique ever developed. Aviram served as the Israel Defense Force Fighting Fitness Academy Krav Maga Chief Instructor, succeeding Eli Avikzar and Imrich Lichtenfeld, the father of Krav Maga.\n\nPure Krav Maga -- Self Defense Mastery DVD Collection demonstrates a complete program of intensive training methods that can bring any man or a woman to master self-defense. Aviram takes a female novice through the entire IDF curriculum, walking you through the myriad of possibilities during confrontations, with training steps to perfect your execution of mental and motor skills and give you the upper hand in a split-second, life or death situation. \n\nIn Krav Maga, efficiency equals being faster than your opponent, and therefore always one step ahead of him. Aviram demonstrates the most efficient methods of attack and defense ever devised, through training steps designed to teach them effectively without making them complicated. In addition, Aviram's explanations and answers to his student's questions make these DVDs an invaluable source for any serious self-defense or Krav Maga instructor. \n\nThe name Krav Maga was first used in the IDF to designate the Hand-to-Hand fighting system developed by Imrich Lichtenfeld, a former European champion in three branches of sports: boxing, gymnastics and wrestling. After serving two years in the British Legions, he immigrated to the future State of Israel, where he initially trained Israeli underground guerrillas in the use of a knife, stick, swimming and Hand-to-Hand combat. When the new State of Israel was created, he became the first IDF Chief Instructor of Hand-to-Hand fighting. Krav Maga was adopted shortly thereafter as the official Hand-to-Hand system of the IDF. \n\nWhen the founder of Krav Maga retired from the IDF, he transformed the 21-hour military intensive training curriculum into a 4 year Dojo training system based on the Japanese Judo ranking system. This civilian adaptation was diluted to be taught over long periods of time, and extracted many of its lethal elements. Imi's rationale was to keep the essence of Krav Maga in the IDF, and make a Civilian system suitable to teach youth. Upon his death, the generic name Krav Maga (\"Contact Combat\" in Hebrew) was adopted by many Martial Arts instructors who respected Imi when he was alive, but commercialized his system after his departure.\n\nBoaz Aviram, determined to preserve the spirit and body of the original Krav Maga, had published the book \"Krav Maga -- Use of the Human Body as a Weapon: Philosophy and Application of Hand to Hand Fighting Training System,\" with tells the true history of the system, its rationale, uniqueness, advantages, and completely documents what the training system is all about and how to use it. Aviram then created this Pure Krav Maga -- Self Defense Mastery collection of training videos, the most comprehensive and detailed course in Krav Maga ever recorded. He is the founder of Pure Krav Maga -- Self Defense Mastery\u2122\n\nContents of the Collection: DVD I Introduction, Specific Warm Up, Pressure Points, Danger Analysis, Reaction Time, Knockout Hand Strikes, and Combat Motion.

In Athens, Ga., and the surrounding areas, March through October are the prime months in most areas and mosquito control is crucial during these months. Learn more about mosquitoes in our learning center. \n\nTreatment\nOur mosquito prevention program services clients monthly from March to October. Our treatment procedure includes:\n\n1. A licensed technician will inspect the area each month to locate breeding sites. The technician will eliminate and/or treat the identified breeding sites with a larvacide which eliminates mosquito larvae in water where they breed. \n\n2. The technician then treats resting areas of adult mosquito populations to help suspend further breeding. Resting areas usually include tree lines, bushes, shrubs, tall grass areas and other growth areas. \n\n\n\nAmerican Pest Control serves the following cities in Georgia with Pest Control programs: \n    American Pest Control Athens, GA,\n    American Pest Control Buford (Serving Gwinnett, Gainesville & Northern Atlanta),\n    American Pest Control Commerce (Serving Jackson & Banks County),\n    American Pest Control Conyers (Serving South Atlanta),\n    American Pest Control Covington (Serving Southeast Atlanta),\n    American Pest Control Greensbroro (Serving Lake Oconee and Madison),\n    American Pest Control Hartwell (Serving Northeast GA and Western SC),\n    American Pest Control Toccoa (Serving Northern GA and Western SC),\n    American Pest Control Washington,\n    American Pest Control Winder. \n\nFor more information check out our website at:\nhttp://www.ampest.com \nor follow us on Facebook at:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/americanpestcontrol", "title": "American Pest Control Athens, Ga., Mosquito Reduction Program", "publishedDate": "2012-08-09T18:56:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fI8_JC5P6k", "description": "Haemorrhage - Eskoria (R.I.P.) - Haemorrhage - Punk Carnage (2012) - Madrid", "title": "Haemorrhage - Eskoria (R.I.P.)", "publishedDate": "2013-01-13T18:01:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fILtxWuFLM", "description": "MDA Bench Press Contest Video - http://youtu.be/vGn6NnRL1vI\n\nFull Workout on Quirts Channel - http://youtu.be/pemmixlEsbk\n\nMY INSTAGRAM - http://www.instagram.com/BigJ_ExtremeFitness\n\nMY TWITTER - http://www.twitter.com/BigJ_ExtFitness\n\nQUIRT'S EMAIL - quirtmc@gmail.com\n\nQUIRT'S INSTAGRAM - http://www.instagram.com/npc_quirt_mcdonald\n\nQUIRT'S TWITTER - http://www.twitter.com/theQuirtMc\n\nQUIRT'S FACE BOOK - http://www.facebook.com/NPCQuirtMcDonald\n\nMATT'S INSTAGRAM - http://www.instagram.com/m_schmidt12\n\nCOMPLETE NUTRITION INFO -\n2517 NE Bob Bullock Loop #103\nLaredo, Texas 78045\n\nROCK FITNESS INFO -\n1707 Jacaman Rd.\nLaredo, Texas 78041\n\nFITCON 2014 Announcement Video - http://youtu.be/qpBYtQeRZv4\n\nFITCON Venue and Hotel Address - \nWaxahachie Civic Center - 2000 Civic Center Lane, Waxahachie Texas 75165\nHampton Inn Suites - 2010 Civic Center Lane, Waxahachie Texas 75165\n\nTo Order FUSIONBODYBUILDING products please visit -\n\nBodybuilding.com - http://alturl.com/m4kbn\n\nSameday Supplements - http://alturl.com/ear8d\n\nParamount Supplements - http://alturl.com/boovy\n\nBodybuilding Warehouse.com - http://alturl.com/c7akd\n\nFUSION'S YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/FusionBodybuilding\nFUSION'S Instagram - http://www.instagram.com/FusionBodybuilding\nFUSION'S Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/FollowFusion\n\nTo Receive 20% OFF ALL GORILLA WEAR PRODUCTS -  Use Promo Code ONEMORE\n\nTo View and Purchase Gorilla Wear Gear visit - http://www.gorillawear.com\n\nFollow Gorilla Wear on Instagram at http://www.instagram.com/GorillaWearUSA", "title": "INTENSE Shoulders with Quirt Mcdonald and Matt Schmidt - Rock Fitness", "publishedDate": "2014-03-26T17:04:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fIPSTwwPos", "description": "While herping in the Everglades, this particular Florida cottonmouth (Akistrodon piscivorus conanti) decided to take refuge on my boots", "title": "Close encounters with a Florida Cottonmouth", "publishedDate": "2012-06-28T16:12:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fIQlyUwVjU", "description": "En images le time-lapse de la renaissance d'Oceanomania le plus grand cabinet de curiosit\u00e9s du monde marin cr\u00e9\u00e9e par Mark Dion.

The pronge of the forceps then slowly closed once the object confirmed in between and gently pulled out along the direction of the long axis of the foreign body.", "title": "Removal of Fishbone Partially Embedded in Right Tonsillar Tissue", "publishedDate": "2011-01-06T12:10:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fJ6hSY-ud8", "description": "http://www.freelumia800.com\n\n\n\n\nlumia ad, lumia advertisement, lumia appaday, lumia apps, lumia amazing everyday, lumia android, lumia advert song, lumia arvostelu, lumia add, lumia ad music, lumia browser, lumia batman, lumia battery, lumia battery life, lumia bluetooth, lumia boot, nokia lumia battery, nokia lumia building, nokia lumia browser, nokia lumia behind the scenes, lumia commercial, lumia coffee tab, lumia coffee, lumia camera, lumia copenhagen, lumia camera test, lumia cyan, lumia crash test, lumia case, nokia lumia commercial song, lumia deadmau5, lumia drop test, lumia denmark, lumia demo, lumia dark knight, lumia design, nokia lumia deadmau5 launch, nokia lumia demo, nokia lumia dark knight, nokia lumia design, deadmau5 nokia lumia event, nokia lumia espresso, nokia lumia event, nokia lumia email, nokia lumia e7, nokia lumia excel, nokia lumia e6, nokia lumia episode, nokia lumia everyday, lumia finland, lumia facebook, lumia features, nokia lumia ft deadmau5, nokia lumia features, deadmau5 lumia full, nokia lumia factory, nokia lumia flash mob, nokia lumia facebook chat, nokia lumia fail, lumia games, lumia gorilla glass test, lumia gameplay, lumia gps, nokia lumia games, nokia lumia gameplay, nokia lumia gps, nokia 800 lumia games, nokia lumia garden", "title": "Lumia 900 Review", "publishedDate": "2012-03-12T17:43:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fJR4nR8k4w", "description": "Folllllow me!! :)\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/Sazclose\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SarahClose95\nhttp://sazclose.tumblr.com\nhttp://instagram.com/sazclose\n\nsorry i haven't uploaded in so long, life kinda got in the way. back now :)", "title": "The Neighbourhood-  Sweater Weather", "publishedDate": "2014-01-31T19:47:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fJuDOzyqqc", "description": "I have re-uploaded this song for better sound quality.\nBrenda Lee's 1970 album \"Memphis Portrait\" is a masterpiece. Period.  Why was it overlooked by the general record-buying public? Why has it not yet even been reissued on compact disc? Good questions - considering the overall excellence of the production, and Brenda's extraordinary vocals. I am going to quote directly from Brenda Lee's autobiography \"Little Miss Dynamite\" concerning this wonderful recording:\n\"Memphis was hot and producer Chips Moman was \"happening.\" Those musicians were making records that were hotter than firecrackers. I was a little bit more excited about the Memphis sessions than I had been about New York (\"Johnny One Time\"). I'd loved r&b since I was a kid. Plus, those musicians were good ol' boys, like the Nashville players, with a laid back attitude but incredible musicianship. \nThe album that resulted was called \"Memphis Portrait\".  I still like that record, but it was a bit of a departure. It was composed about half-and-half of hit Memphis soul tunes and newly written songs. I remember that we lived in that studio, recording around the clock for about a week. We practically slept there. We had food catered in, and we had plenty of good times. It was exhausting, but it was fun. \nToo bad it was all for naught. It turned out that 1969's \"Johnny One Time\" was my swan song as a pop hit maker - the Memphis single \"I Think I Love You Again\" failed to duplicate its success. In fact, the track stalled way down at No. 97 on Billboard's \"Hot 100\" chart. But I kept plugging away. I promoted \"Memphis Portrait\" by performing \"Proud Mary\" on Johnny Cash's national TV series. I poured my heart into it. Looking at that clip today, man, I was really rocking. But as good as it was, my \"soul\" LP was a commercial failure.  That was it. I told the record company, \"I'm tired of all this experimentation. I want to go back to where I belong.  I want to go back with Owen\".  So that's what I did. I returned to Nashville (and) reunited with Owen Bradley.\"  Produced by Chips Moman - recorded at American Recording Studios in Memphis TN.\n\nUploaded with Free Video Converter from Freemake\nhttp://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/", "title": "Brenda Lee - Proud Mary", "publishedDate": "2014-02-23T19:28:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fKJe96RyzM", "description": "Label: Gold Music\nDigital distribution:  http://www.kvzmusic.com/ \nYoutube powered by: http://vipper.tv/\n\nMusic: \nlyrics:  \nArr:     \nVideo:", "title": "Elma - Gradske price - (Audio 2005)", "publishedDate": "2013-03-10T12:24:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fKUmqzoeY0", "description": "", "title": "The Enfields - Time Card", "publishedDate": "2010-12-09T17:59:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fKfosvXDJM", "description": "NHS Ashford Clinical Commissioning Group has worked with local health and care teams to develop the Community Geriatrician Project.

You can also use lip liner to define the shape of your lips, and lip gloss to give you a shiny finish.  This step by step guide will help you perfect the art.\n\nThere are basically six items that you will need -- lipstick, lip balm, lip brushes, lip liner, facial tissues and a mirror.\n\nTo start with, chose the right lipstick colour for the correct occasion. Go for colours that complement the natural shade of your lips, using darker tones that complement your overall colouring. Matte lipsticks give a muted finish suitable for daytime use, satin & gloss finishes offer more of an evening look. Cosmetic counters and high street chemists have a large range of colours available.\n\nMake sure you have applied all other make up before putting on lipstick and lip liner. Dab a small amount of lip balm or petroleum jelly to make your lips moist. Draw a thin line along the edge of your lips with a lip liner whose colour is one shade darker than the lipstick. Start in the middle of your upper lip and work outwards. Stay on the outer edges to open up thin lips and line well within the edges to understate very full lips.\n\nApply lipstick from the tube, or you can use a firm small lipstick brush. Coat the lips evenly, and make sure you stay within the edge of the lips.\n\nWhen you have finished, blot your lipsto remove Any excess colour and to even out the texture.\n\nFinally, five useful tips for applying lip stick:\n\nRemember to touch up the lips after a meal, as lipstick can transfer to coffee cups. \nFor a longer lasting colour, shade both lips with lip liner after defining them. As your lipstick fades throughout the day, the liner offers a hint of colour. \nBalance heavy eye makeup with a soft lip colour. \nTo give the illusion of a thicker top lip, line its outermost edges. Forgo the liner on the bottom lip. \nChill your lip liner so that it sharpens more easily.", "title": "How To Apply Make Up - Part 3 - Lipstick and Lip Gloss", "publishedDate": "2008-03-29T11:43:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fOKBdPsRHQ", "description": "2013\nS.U.S.C.R.I.B.E.T.E", "title": "El Dolor es Temporal - THR Cru2.", "publishedDate": "2013-09-01T04:20:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fPhBEdUFe4", "description": "Try opinion outpost to get free rewards! - http://bit.ly/OOMirfandas\n\ni hope you lick my music video!\n\nTICKET INFO FOR MY TOUR! \nNashville, TN - 10/10 - http://tinyurl.com/kwwptua\nAtlanta - 10/12 - http://tinyurl.com/kqn84cv\nAtlanta 2ND show added!! 10/12 - http://tinyurl.com/nt7psfb\nCalgary, AB - 10/23 - http://tinyurl.com/lcpb8od\nVancouver, BC - 10/24 - http://tinyurl.com/kmh2tss\nIndianapolis, IN - 10/31 - http://tinyurl.com/kpqudvp\nJoliet, IL - 11/1 - http://tinyurl.com/pj5zmru\nUK TOUR!! - 11/5-16 -  http://tinyurl.com/k2vf82e\nTempe, AZ - 11/22 - http://tinyurl.com/ptjnpd4\nPhoenix, AZ - 11/23 - http://tinyurl.com/q66tgmh\nHouston, TX -1/10/15 -  http://tinyurl.com/mqls3bb\nNew Orleans, LA - 1/11/15 - http://tinyurl.com/onsjpw3\nOrlando, FL - 1/13/15 - http://tinyurl.com/qe5v2j9\nJacksonville, FL - 1/14/15 - http://tinyurl.com/mvlrakn\nDurham, NC - 1/16/15 - http://tinyurl.com/n9hoc5x\nKnoxville, TN -1/17/15 - http://tinyurl.com/ojgvvkd\nLas Vegas, NV - 1/24/15 - http://tinyurl.com/opffc2d\nLas Vegas, NV 2ND SHOW - 1/25/15 http://tinyurl.com/opffc2d\nBirmingham, AL - 2/7/15 http://tinyurl.com/p6rjeo7\nLos Angeles, CA - 2/23/15 - http://tinyurl.com/kbxfslr\nHartford, CT 4/25/15  http://tinyurl.com/qalv6k8\n\nThis video is sponsored, but all opinions are my own.", "title": "TALK DIRTY TO ME - music video", "publishedDate": "2014-04-21T08:29:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fPi1UEijg8", "description": "A NEW Black Ops 2 hidden bonus!!!

Professor Liam Sinclair and Dr Kenton Hart hope that the research will prove invaluable to farmers.\n\nProf. Sinclair said: \"Dairy cows, as ruminants, produce quite a lot of methane as a consequence of their digestive system. As well as being bad for the environment, this is also ineffective for farmers because it's wasted energy that could be used to produce milk.\n\n\"So, we're looking at different diets to reduce the methane production and the backpacks monitor this by taking a sample of gas, from the front of the cow, for a period of 24 hours. This means that at the end of a day, we know exactly how much methane a cow has produced and how this then relates to the different feeds.\"\n\nThe cows wear the backpacks for five day periods, after which they are introduced to a different feed and substrates, given time to adjust, and then the packs are worn again to monitor the next set of results.\n\nAlthough the packs may look uncomfortable, the cows still behave as normal. Professor Liam added: \"The cows don't seem bothered at all because they are happy to eat, ruminate and lie down, it doesn't seem to affect them. They soon get used to them.\n\n\"What we are trying to do is provide farmers with advice to help them reduce their carbon footprint, or carbon 'hoofprint', because if any carbon taxes are introduced, farmers need to know what action they can take.  This will also help their animals to become more productive, so really, it's a win-win situation.\"\n\nThis is among several dairy cow research projects currently being undertaken at Harper Adams. Others include the welfare implications of grazing high-yielding dairy cows, and the effect of organic and inorganic copper on copper status and performance in dairy cattle.", "title": "Reducing methane output in dairy cows", "publishedDate": "2010-07-20T13:55:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "6fZHmYr0UQ4", "description": "This is a focus tester... and a pen!!!... etc. Like how ninjas always carrying concealed ordinary items as weapons, this is also a weapon.

The plants develop seed pods that burst spreading the seeds far away. The plant grows in large numbers and sometimes the whole mountainous regions where the plant is seen is covered with pink! The flap of a petal looks like an helmet and this plant is also called the policeman's helmet.\n\nThe scientific name is Impatiens Balsamina and actually the balsam plant is a herb producing colourful flowers. There are many colour seen in balsam plants and many grow tall according tot eh conditions provided. The plant grown in small containers grows for two to three feet and flowers profusely. The leaves of balsam are bright green in colour growing in central arrangement and have wavy edges. The blooms are almost similar to rose flowers and from far they look like roses , just for the fact that they do not have thorns!.

Cette nouvelle structure est extraordinaire, parce qu'elle doit soutenir une route \u00e0 quatre voies tout en permettant l'\u00e9coulement de la rivi\u00e8re dans toutes sortes de conditions m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques. Constitu\u00e9 d'une s\u00e9rie de vo\u00fbtes sans fond en b\u00e9ton manufactur\u00e9, le passage a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit pour durer. Parce que les arches sont couvertes de remblai, elles ne n\u00e9cessitent que peu d'entretien. Le co\u00fbt de leur cycle de vie sera faible, du fait qu'il n'y a ni joint ni tablier \u00e0 entretenir. \n\nMontage et r\u00e9alisation : Leslie Campbell", "title": "Aider les poissons \u00e0 traverser la route dans le parc national Banff", "publishedDate": "2014-06-13T15:11:05.000Z"}]
