Une intervention basique qui peut vous \u00e9viter bien des frais de d\u00e9pannage.\n\nEtape 1 Comment d\u00e9monter l'ancien siphon ?\nD\u00e9boucher un \u00e9vier ou un lavabo\n- Placez un r\u00e9cipient sous le siphon, d\u00e9vissez ensuite le culot de visite et videz-le.\n- Pour un simple d\u00e9bouchage, nettoyez le culot et l'int\u00e9rieur du siphon. Quand tout est propre, il suffit de revisser le culot puis de faire couler l'eau pour v\u00e9rifier le bon \u00e9coulement.\nD\u00e9monter le siphon\n-  La pince multiprise permet si besoin d'amorcer le desserrage. D\u00e9vissez compl\u00e8tement l'\u00e9crou \u00e0 collet c\u00f4t\u00e9 bonde, puis celui du raccordement d'\u00e9vacuation. \n- Tirez doucement le corps du siphon pour le d\u00e9gager du tuyau de raccordement d'\u00e9vacuation.\n\nM\u00eame si votre siphon est en bon \u00e9tat et m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre conserv\u00e9, \nil est utile de savoir le d\u00e9monter lorsqu'un bouchon s'est form\u00e9 plus loin dans la canalisation. Le d\u00e9montage permet alors de passer un furet par le tuyau d'\u00e9vacuation.\n\nEtape 2 Comment monter un nouveau siphon ?\n- D\u00e9vissez l'\u00e9crou \u00e0 collet destin\u00e9 au raccordement d'\u00e9vacuation. \nEngagez l'\u00e9crou sur le tuyau, puis le joint d'\u00e9tanch\u00e9it\u00e9 \u00e0 compression.\n- Engagez le siphon dans la canalisation et placez-le dans l'axe de la bonde.\n- Desserrez l\u00e9g\u00e8rement l'\u00e9crou du dessus pour permettre le r\u00e9glage de hauteur par coulissement.\n- Raccordez \u00e0 la bonde sans oublier le joint d'\u00e9tanch\u00e9it\u00e9, puis serrez chaque \u00e9crou \u00e0 collet. \n- Ramenez le joint d'\u00e9vacuation et son \u00e9crou \u00e0 collet contre le filetage du siphon et serrez l'\u00e9crou.\n\nReste \u00e0 faire couler un peu d'eau pour v\u00e9rifier votre installation \net le tour est jou\u00e9.\n\nCAISSE A OUTIL\nPince multiprise\nChiffon ou essuie-tout\nSeau\n\nMATERIAUX NECESSAIRES\nNouveau siphon\n\nRespectez toujours les consignes d'utilisation et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 figurant sur la notice du produit.", "title": "Comment changer un siphon ?

With 34 million copies sold as of August, this latest upgrade is just running up the score on Rockstar\u2019s competition.\n\nBut if the GTA makers wants to shake the misogynistic label and avoid being the poster child for gamergate, why is it that only women are depicted as sex objects.\n\nWhere are the transexuals for hire? What if I\u2019m in the mood for a handsome male hustler? And why isn\u2019t Bob Saget sucking d**k for coke?

According to a popular legend, the first wooden Orthodox chapel located on the place of today's St. Nicholas church was built around 1340. Seven years later, the Vilnius martyrs were supposedly buried there. However, in 1350, Uliana of Tver, the second wife of prince Algirdas, ordered to build a new brick church. In 1514 this church was again replaced with a larger one. It remained Orthodox up to 1609, when, like most of Vilnius Orthodox churches, it was given to the Uniates on a personal order of the king Sigismund III Vasa.\n\nAround 1740 the church was completely destroyed by fire and rebuilt in Baroque style. In 1839 the Russian local government closed the Uniate parish and given the building back to the Orthodox. After the failed Polish January Uprising, it was completely rebuilt in Neo-Byzantine style on the personal initiative of general-governor of Vilnius Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov-Vilensky. The renewed church was to be another sign of Russian domination in the city, becoming the fifth Orthodox church in the Old Town of Vilnius. Muraviev ordered also the construction of St. Michael the Archangel chapel which was to commemorate his victory over the Polish uprising. In 1866 the whole church was reconsecrated. The general-governor's role in the reconstruction of the church was described on a marble plaque on the western wall of the church.\n\nAfter World War II the church was closed, but in 1947 the Stalinist government agreed to reopen it as a parish church. The general renovation of the building took place before 1956.\n\nThis film features both external and internal views of the church, with a particular focus on the church's architecture and decor including religious artworks such as paintings, statues and sculptures.", "title": "\u0160v.

Het doel van de operatie is om de oogstand te corrigeren, zodat de ogen rechter komen te staan. Een reden voor deze operatie kan uit cosmetisch oogpunt zijn, maar ook de samenwerking van de ogen kan worden verbeterd. De oogstand zal meestal verbeteren. Om het optimale resultaat te bereiken, is soms een tweede operatie nodig. De operatie heeft geen invloed op de gezichtsscherpte.\n\nWat is scheelzien?\nScheelzien is een afwijking van de stand van de ogen, waarbij de ogen niet op hetzelfde punt gericht zijn. Er zijn verschillende vormen van scheelzien. Meestal kijkt \u00e9\u00e9n oog rechtuit en het andere oog wijkt af. Het afwijkende oog kan naar boven, naar beneden, richting de neus of naar het oor staan. Een combinatie, zoals een afwijkend oog dat richting de neus en naar boven wijkt, is ook mogelijk. Het ontstaat meestal op kinderleeftijd, maar het kan ook bij volwassenen optreden. Scheelzien komt voor bij 3 - 5% van de bevolking.\n\nWanneer de beide ogen niet op hetzelfde punt gericht staan, treedt er dubbelzien op. Wanneer het scheelzien voor het 6e levensjaar ontstaat, hebben kinderen de mogelijkheid het beeld afkomstig uit het oog met de afwijkende stand in hun hersenen te onderdrukken. Hierdoor kan een 'lui oog' (amblyopie) ontstaan. Wanneer het scheelzien na het 6e jaar ontstaat, wordt het beeld van het afwijkende oog niet meer onderdrukt en wordt er wel dubbel gezien.\n\nWat gebeurt er bij de operatie?\nIeder oog heeft zes oogspieren, die voor de beweging van het oog zorgen en aan de buitenkant van het oog onder het bindvlies vastzitten. Tijdens de operatie wordt het bindvlies wat op de oogbol zit, los gemaakt. Daarna wordt de spier die geopereerd moet worden, losgemaakt en opgevist met een speciaal haakje. Vervolgens wordt deze spier verzwakt of versterkt door het te verplaatsen of in te korten. Er is een kleine kans dat bij het hechten van de spier, de oogarts te diep met het naaldje gaat en door het hoornvlies gaat. Dit plekje wordt direct bevroren om complicaties te voorkomen. De operatie gebeurt aan een of beide ogen en altijd onder narcose. In de meeste gevallen heeft de operatie voldoende functioneel of cosmetisch resultaat.\n\nGang van zaken\nNa een gesprek met de opererende oogarts, komt u op de operatielijst. Daarna krijgt u van het opnamebureau een datum voor een dagbehandeling. Dit betekent dat u 's morgens komt en in principe 's middags of aan het begin van de avond weer naar huis mag. Ook krijgt u een afspraak voor een intakegesprek met de anesthesioloog en een verpleegkundige.\n\nBij uw bezoek aan de oogarts en orthoptist krijgt u een recept voor ontstekingsremmende oogdruppels. Tip: Haalt u deze oogdruppels voor de operatie bij uw apotheek!\n\nDe operatie\nDe operatie vindt plaats onder volledige narcose. De voorbereiding van de operatie duurt ongeveer een half uur, de operatie duurt 1 tot 1\u00bd uur.\n\nNa de operatie\nOm ontsteking te voorkomen krijgt u meteen wat zalf in het geopereerde oog. Er wordt geen verband op het geopereerde oog gedaan. Na de operatie zullen de ogen rood en wat gezwollen en pijnlijk zijn. Om infectie te voorkomen moet u uw ogen twee keer per dag druppelen met de oogdruppels die u van de apotheek heeft gehaald. Dit blijft u doen tot uw controleafspraak bij de orthoptist.\n\nDe zwelling zal na enkele dagen wegtrekken en het duurt enkele weken voordat de roodheid helemaal is verdwenen. U kunt wat last hebben van de hechtingen van het bindvlies; ze kunnen een beetje prikken of het voelt net of er iets in het oog zit. Deze hechtingen hoeven er niet uitgehaald worden, maar lossen vanzelf op.\n\nIn principe mag u na de operatie alles doen. Meestal zien we dat de pati\u00ebnten ongeveer vijf dagen thuis blijven. Hervatten van het werk is afhankelijk van het soort werk dat u doet. Bij werk in een stoffige omgeving is het aan te raden twee weken te wachten voordat u weer aan het werk gaat. Omdat een of meer oogspieren zijn los geweest (en vervolgens weer gehecht aan de oogbol) is het beter de eerste weken niet in uw ogen te wrijven.\n\nHet is mogelijk dat u na het rechtzetten van de ogen (tijdelijk) dubbelziet. Dit verdwijnt meestal binnen enkele weken.\n\nOmdat u na ontslag uit het ziekenhuis nog niet mag deelnemen aan het verkeer, is het goed om vooraf vervoer naar huis te regelen.\n\nAdviezen\nTot twee weken na de operatie kunt u beter niet zwemmen. Douchen mag wel, let er hierbij wel op dat u geen zeep in de ogen krijgt.\nPast u op voor vuil. Als u bij winderig weer naar buiten gaat, is het belangrijk dat u een (zonne)bril draagt. Dit voorkomt dat weggewaaide stofdeeltjes irritaties en ontstekingen veroorzaken.\nHet is voor het herstel aan te raden de eerste week na de operatie regelmatig 'heen en weer te kijken'. Dit kan eventuele verklevingen voorkomen.\nU kunt uw eigen bril na de operatie weer gewoon dragen.", "title": "Strabismus Operatie (ogen)", "publishedDate": "2013-03-21T00:08:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "2YcPwnp_S7E", "description": "Dr. Donn Jacobs   24 Maple Avenue Rockville Centre, NY 11570", "title": "Dr. Donn Jacobs, Endodontist", "publishedDate": "2011-11-03T16:56:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "2YcSmYFkWmY", "description": "Music video by Bon Jovi performing No Apologies.

It was sitting in storage for a year until this past October. She was just about to donate it because it was collecting dust, but decided to use it for her daughter's fifth birthday party, which falls right before Halloween.\n\n[Julie Keith, Portland, Oregon]: \n\"And as I opened some of the Styrofoam headstones, a note popped out. I opened the note and it was from this person pleading for help in the labor camp in China and wasn't sure what to do with it.\"\n\nThe letter, written at the Masanjia Labor Camp in Shenyang, northeast China, paints a grizzly picture. \n\n\"If you occasionally buy this product, please kindly resend this letter to the World Human Right Organization. Thousands people here who are under the persecution of the Chinese Communist Party Government will thank and remember you forever.\"\n\nThe letter claims detainees work 15-hour days and are paid less than $2 USD a month for forced labor. It says thousands are held there, and that many are persecuted Falun Gong practitioners.\n\nAnd it doesn't end there. It goes on to say , \"People who work here, suffer punishment 1-3 years averagely, but without Court Sentence (unlaw punishment). Many of them are Falun Gong practitioners, who are totally innocent people only because they have different believe to CCPG. They often suffer more punishment than others.\"\n\n[Julie Keith, Damascus, Oregon]:\n\" The first thing I did was Google the labor camp and it horrified me... some of the stories coming from there. But it really made me happy that I don't live in a country where that kind of thing happens.\"\n\nChina's labor re-education system is notorious for rights abuses. The system is used heavily in the Communist regime's persecution of the Falun Gong spiritual practice. In 2008, the US State Department estimated up to half of the 200,000 registered detainees in Chinese labor camps were Falun Gong adherents.\n\n[Julie Keith, Damascus, Oregon]: \n\"I was aware there were prison camps and forced labor, but just not anything so horrific.\"\n\nJulie says she's she spoken to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security Investigations, who are now looking into the claims.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSears Holdings Corporations, which runs Kmart, has also said it is holding its own investigations.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntd.tv\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "Woman Finds Hidden Letter from Chinese Labor Camp Inside Kamart Product", "publishedDate": "2012-12-28T08:07:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "2YjmBezpyT0", "description": "Ethan demos how to avoid chunking or hitting it fat.", "title": "Stop Chunking - How I Play Golf (Ethan Chung)", "publishedDate": "2011-08-15T05:26:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Yjun7hYb38", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "Come to PC land xox omg", "publishedDate": "2014-08-20T10:09:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Yk2fjcvtdI", "description": "Galapagos islands, Sta Fe Island, the spotted eagle ray is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Speciesexternal link", "title": "Spotted eagle ray Aetobatus narinari", "publishedDate": "2014-10-02T11:47:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2YkQFMmwJA0", "description": "Video of different cover art available on The Torments 7\" 45 from Monster Mash Records", "title": "The Torments - Gravedigger", "publishedDate": "2013-10-28T13:02:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "2YlbTSmkLek", "description": "She's on the prowl in the front yeard", "title": "This is Honkie The Cat", "publishedDate": "2008-04-12T00:46:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Ylc0Uh72K0", "description": "Prof. Cao says about molecular mechanisms of pathological angiogenesis that contributes to obesity, metabolic diseases and diabetic complications.\n\nYihai Cao is an international leading scientist in vascular biology who is a highly talented, imaginative and creative scientist.

current state-of-the-art methods. The semi-direct approach eliminates the need of costly feature extraction and robust matching techniques for motion estimation. Our algorithm operates directly on pixel intensities, which results in subpixel precision at high frame-rates. A probabilistic mapping method that explicitly models outlier measurements is used to estimate 3D points, which results in fewer outliers and more reliable points. Precise and high frame-rate motion estimation brings increased robustness in scenes of little, repetitive, and high-frequency texture. The algorithm is applied to micro-aerial-vehicle state-estimation in GPS-denied environments and runs at 55 frames per second on the onboard embedded computer and at more than 300 frames per second on a consumer laptop. We call our approach SVO (Semi-direct Visual Odometry) and release our implementation as open-source software.\n\n(The code will be available after the conference)\n\nPaper: http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/ICRA14_Forster.pdf\n\nC.

Ambos sexos en cada una de sus cuatro alas poseen una mancha que se asemeja a un ojo, lo cu\u00e1l les da su nombre. Son insectos con un pelaje que las cubre y que les da la apariencia de ser afelpadas.\n\nCuriosamente las hembras son nocturnas mientras que los machos son diurnos. El encuentro para poder aparearse tiene lugar durante la ma\u00f1ana, cu\u00e1ndo las hembras, luego de una noche de actividad se posan sobre un \u00e1rbol y el macho la encuentra al oler las feromonas sexuales de la hembra a trav\u00e9s de sus antenas. Es por las antenas donde huele este insecto y por eso el macho las tiene mas desarrolladas que la hembra.\nLuego del apareamiento el macho queda exhausto y muere, la hembra entonces pondr\u00e1 sus huevos en una planta, que suele ser un mait\u00e9n (Maytenus boaria), un \u00e1rbol nativo de Chile aunque tambi\u00e9n se da en maqui (Aristotelia chilensis) o peumo (Cryptocarya alba). Las cuncunas nacen luego de poco menos de dos meses, tienen un color gris\u00e1ceo y crecen r\u00e1pido aliment\u00e1ndose de las hojas del mait\u00e9n. Luego que alcanzan su desarrollo m\u00e1ximo las cuncunas hacen su capullo, los de las hembras suelen ser mas grandes que los de los machos. Un dato curioso es que si tocas esos capullos \u00a1se mueven! Distintas especies de mariposas hacen esto si se las molesta cu\u00e1ndo son capullos.\nLos adultos alados emergen luego de 5 meses de desarrollo dentro de este y cuentan con al rededor de una semana para encontrar pareja y reproducirse. Pueden enfocarse 100% a esta tarea ya que su sistema digestivo est\u00e1 atrofiado: viven de sus reservas energ\u00e9ticas acumuladas en la fase de oruga. \n\nFuente: http://especieschilenas.blogspot.com/2013/04/la-mariposa-de-cuatro-ojos-polythysana.html", "title": "Polythysana Cinerascens", "publishedDate": "2014-01-29T20:17:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "2YnvnC32upA", "description": "Bas van Elteren geeft tips hoe je het beste een Rododendron kunt onderhouden.

So we just discussed and showed a truck into what's called a banana split. Now through that transition, I discussed and explained a little bit on what's known as a calf slicer. I'd like to just go over that again and add some more detail. So let's start again on attacking the turtle and entering into the truck, but focusing on attacking that leg. Let's do that. Okay. So arms in turtle. And I have my hook. And same thing, it's not working. So right here. Now let's talk about attacking this leg. I can engage, I really want to hold onto close by the toes, not really by the ankle here. Right here. Now I can also do two in one. It doesn't have to be each leg. I can focus on just one leg. \n\nAs I sit, I want to place this foot on my foot here, on my heel. Okay. And as I sit back, I can push a little bit with my weight and pull in. Okay. Now I have my submission there. Now if my opponent rolls, because it is quite painful, I'm going to follow my partner. And sometimes I can't get the banana split. So you see this position I'm laying here? Now same caution. I do not want to expose my arm. See, I have the submission right there, so it's quite dangerous. So if you can't do the banana split, we can still attack with this calf slicer. Just need to make sure that I don't expose my elbow. And I stay with the same details, controlling the toes, pushing off with my foot, and pulling in. \n\nLet's do that again. Okay. Have the hook in. . I hook and turn and face my target. Two on one in this case. I sit back. I make sure I'm controlling the toes. And I place my foot  right here. And I sit back and pull. If he rolls, I move with him. Make sure I'm not exposing the arm. The submission there. And I apply the same submission.

Some played with G.I.Joes or dreamed of being a fireman. A lucky few were able to keep playing their entire lives and John Ormandy just happens to be one of those lucky people. When John was a young boy, he enjoyed playing with model trains, as did most little boys, and he now owns his own model train and toy store.\n\nWhen John's original train needed repair, he discovered that the manufacturer, the M\u00e4rklin company from Germany, didn't have a service department in the anywhere in the United States and his train would have to be sent to Germany for the needed repairs. Seeing opportunity at hand, he negotiated with M\u00e4rklin, and now is one of the largest M\u00e4rklin dealers in the country. Specializing in repairing and selling both new and used model trains, Ormandy's stocks everything you need to build a train set complete with landscaping and they provide appraisal service to owners of vintage models. M\u00e4rklin is his first love due to their superior quality, hence the saying, \"M\u00e4rklin Builds a Train, All The Others Try.\" John also stocks a large selection of Lionel, L.G.B., Schuco, and many other fine European trains along with products manufactured in the U.S.A. and throughout the rest of the world. Above the store is the Medina Toy and Train Museum which is open on the weekends and showcases an exhilarating display of antique toys and trains. The museum is so popular that over thirty thousand people have been through this museum in the two years it has been open with many coming from out of state and even other countries to delight in his display.\n\nSo the next time that your train is due for a bit of repair or you're looking for trains, supplies, or just a trip down memory lane, stop in and don't forget to tell John that The Advocate sent you!", "title": "Ormandy's Toys and Trains Medina, Ohio 44256", "publishedDate": "2009-03-25T21:53:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ZOZENExzFs", "description": "SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/user/SelinasNailArt\n\nProducts used:\nhttp://www.bornprettystore.com/\nRose Decals:\nhttp://www.bornprettystore.com/1sheet-charming-flower-rosette-patterned-nail-water-decals-transfers-sticker-g055g124a-p-12672.html\nhttp://www.bornprettystore.com/1sheet-graceful-arabesque-flower-patterned-nail-water-decals-transfers-sticker-g115g102c-p-12674.html\nNail Art Stud Wheels:\nhttp://www.bornprettystore.com/350pcs-round-square-stud-rhinestones-nail-decoration-wbox-sale-p-7278.html\nhttp://www.bornprettystore.com/300pcs-dazzling-heart-star-leaf-drop-shaped-stud-rhinestone-nail-decoration-wbox-p-12410.html\n\nMore Nail Art Ideas:\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO1ck88tbrw&list=UU9mJ5SsiDpAjABy7nhzRggA\n\nFind Me On: \n\u2665IG: http://instagram.com/selinasnailart#\n\u2665FB: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Selinas-Nail-Art/195540147266570\n\u2665TWITTER: https://twitter.com/Selinas_NailArt\n\nContact E-mail: slrodriguez06@gmailcom\n\nKEYWORDS: nail art, nail designs, selina's nail art, selinas nail art, nail art 2012, nail art design step by step, nail art for short nails, nail tutorial, nail art tutorial, nail polish", "title": "Rose Water Decal & Gold Studs Nail Art | Bornprettystore.com Review", "publishedDate": "2014-07-02T16:55:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ZO_uGvrVpo", "description": "Willie Eames is an amazing singer, songwriter, and guitar player in Lexington, Kentucky.

Such acts of courage and patriotism, which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should be encouraged rather than stifled. We need to empower federal employees as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance. Barack Obama will strengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in government. Obama will ensure that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process.\n\n\n\nAdditional Keywords: sarah palin john mccain education economy bush friedman hayek ludwig von mises institute immigration health care global warming supreme court bailout bail out drugs sex gay marriage election 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024religion ayers new york times oil revolution free state project libertarian party freedom secession independence united states u.s. constitutionalist market anarchist anarchism anarchy mary ruwart bob barr michael badnarik government gun rights guns fascism communism secede civil disobedience law federal reserve department of homeland security feds fed sovereign tyranny irs john lynch taxation taxes tax real id rebellion police abuse campaign for liberty live free or die congress congressional district iraq war patriot act socialism slavery coercion force campaign for liberty cato Institute murray rothbard hayek milton friedman alan greenspan tim geithner united nations new world order senator Dr Ron Paul President Senate Congress Senator Congressman business presidential campaign Barack Hussein Obama CNN hot family hello fox news web internet breaking news mature movies music love new videos other world how to free best citizen citizenship government legal illegal money real homes you youtube celebrity priceless currency generation", "title": "Change is DEAD No More Begging To The Slave Master", "publishedDate": "2013-07-29T21:14:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ZTf8kLYQQI", "description": "Running in huaraches at different paces.

It is made of a special red-colored sand stone, which imparts a rich look to it.  The Sikandra Fort in stands in great grandeur amidst a lush green garden, which is surrounded on all sides with lofty walls. \n\nThe blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) is an ungulate species of antelope native to the Indian Subcontinent that has been classified as near threatened by IUCN since 2003, as its range has decreased sharply during the 20th century. The native population is stable, with an estimated 50,000 individuals.\n\nThe blackbuck is the only living species of the genus Antilope. Its generic name stems from the Latin word antalopus, a horned animal. The specific name cervicapra is composed of the Latin words capra, she-goat and cervus, deer.\n\nBlackbucks generally live on open plains in herds of 5 to 50 animals with one dominant male. They are very fast. Speeds of more than 80 km/h (50 mph) have been recorded.\n\nThey are primarily grazers and avoid forested areas. They require water every day and may move long distances in search of water and forage in summer. Usually, they feed during the day. Their diet consists mostly of grasses, but they have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia trees in the Cholistan Desert. In the Velavadar National Park, they were observed feeding on pods of Prosopis juliflora during seasonal lows in forage quality. The maximum life span recorded is 16 years and the average is 12 years.\n\nsource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

The activated carbon reduces antibacterial properties of in water possibly contained pathogens and frees it from the water hard salts and chlorine. The tourmaline-precious minerals filling causes an ionization of the water and lowers the redox potential. Calcium mineral elements (Maha-Q) to make the water soft and precious.The filter is suitable for 8000 L of water, which is equivalent to a daily application of a duration of 4-6 months. Thereafter, the contents of the filter are easily replaced.\n\n\nWhy is it so important to use water with alkaline pH?\n\n\nThe body's organs and body tissues consist of 70 to 80% water solutions, the respective pH limits are clearly defined. You can function normally within the pH limits. Particularly strict are the limits for the pH of the blood. The pH of blood is 7.35 to 7.45 (basic!). A person can only survive if the pH of his blood in these limits. Therefore it is vital that everything we eat processed by our bodies so that the pH of the blood remains within these limits.\n\nAt present 80% of the population suffer due to acidosis. A farmiliar quote: \"You're not sick - you are too acidic.\"\n\nWith acidosis, the body's base depots empties to the point that over time the connective tissue is weak (cellulitis), bone density decreases (osteoporosis), the teeth become loose (periodontitis), turn out the hair, aching joints (rheumatism , gout, arthritis), fungal infections occur more frequently (foot, nail, skin and genital fungus). There is a harmful for the body metabolism, which the development of many diseases hervorruft.Deswegen it is so important to supply our body with water, the pH in the alkaline range. With the aid of the inert minerals filter, which is located in the shower head, the shower water has a basic pH value is replaced by 8.0 to 9.0\n\n\nWhy is our health, water and redox potential in the negative range so important?\n\n\nEach liquid possesses a certain redox potential which  is measured in millivolts (mV). Also the, blood, blood plasma and interstitial fluids of the human body have a particular redox potential which can be calculated and measured. The redox potential of the blood, calculated using the Nernst equation taking into account the pH, has the following values:\n\n\u2022 Arterial blood - about minus 57mV\n\n\u2022 Venous blood - about minus 7mV\n\nThe measurements carried out of most tap water show alarming result. The redox values \u200b\u200bof the water we are use every day are beyond the body's own. It is so important to supply our body with water, the redox potential in the red area near the values \u200b\u200bof the blood liegt.Mit using the filter ionizer of precious minerals receives the water has a reduced redox potential.\n\nmore at: www.dina-aschbach.com", "title": "Aschbach_Alkaline_Water_Duschkopf_englisch.wmv", "publishedDate": "2012-07-26T10:40:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Z_tLo-fbNA", "description": "The Klamath Indians of Oregon get their tribal rights back.

In fact, using powerful glasses can worsen eye problems. Therefore, one should use glasses only when absolutely necessary.\n\nOther than a few diseases such as cataract and glaucoma which occur due to bacterial infections, many eye disorders are related to the malfunctioning of the ocular muscles caused by chronic mental and emotional tensions.

Check out my website for more food http://migrationology.com/\n\nI arrived to Varanasi, India, in the winter, in early February, and when I was walking around on the streets I noticed a huge pan of something yellow that almost looked like soap suds. There wasn't just a single street food vendor selling this stuff, there were many many of them and they always attracted quite a few customers who would stop on the side of the road, grab a quick dish, chow it down furiously and then continue on their way. So one day while I was in Varanasi, I decided it was time to try it for myself. During this video, I had no clue what it was or what it included, I was just curious to sample it and see what it all included. So I found a vendor with a fresh supply and he informed me that it was called malaiyo. \n\nMalaiyo is a seasonal famous Varanasi dessert, it's available throughout the state of Uttar Pradesh but normally only in the winter. It's a milk dairy based dessert, almost like a pudding that's been fluffed with air. I ordered a clay bold full of malaiyo, which cost just 10 Rupees, and I was all ready to dig in. It was extremely light and fluffly, really the texture was about like thick soap suds. It was like eating sweet egg bubbles. Along with the creamy foam, the malaiyo was seasoned nicely with lots of sugar and I could really detect a lot of cardamon, a spice that's commonly added to desserts in India. Finally, each dish was sprinkled with a few pistachios to make it complete.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my first taste of Indian malaiyo. It's not something I would eat everyday, but I sure loved it. It was extremely light, offered zero filling for the stomach but just tasted good and was a nice sweet treat while walking through the chaotic streets of Varanasi, India.\n\nFollow my food adventures at http://migrationology.com/ & http://www.eatingthaifood.com/ Delhi Travel Guide: http://migrationology.com/delhi-travel-guide-ebook/\nBangkok Travel Guide: http://migrationology.com/ebook-101-things-to-do-in-bangkok/\nThai Food Guide: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/eating-thai-food-guide/\nFinally, subscribe so you don't miss the next tasty adventure http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=migrationology", "title": "Malaiyo - Indian Foam Dessert in Varanasi, India", "publishedDate": "2013-06-05T13:02:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ZooG0fYYmY", "description": "Darius performs the Toreador Song from Carmen on Popstar to Opera Star, episode 2.", "title": "Darius Campbell - Toreador Song (Popstar to Opera Star)", "publishedDate": "2010-01-23T03:55:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ZpFSS5yLU0", "description": "This video describes the Thymine dimer", "title": "Thymine Dimer", "publishedDate": "2013-04-06T18:19:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ZpYJPwtt04", "description": "", "title": "\u0627\u0636\u062d\u0643 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0643\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u062e\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0633\u0644\u0651\u0627\u0644 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a   jdid salal 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-04-01T12:33:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Zq09JOcfIk", "description": "memes hadi & chow9i khatri", "title": "ENTI BA9IYA WA7ED ( mauritanie)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-12T22:51:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Zq3HMPZrQ8", "description": "The scenes from Love Stage!! anime english subbed episode 03\nRyouma x Izumi x Ryouma, Shougo x Rei\nOur fanpage https://www.facebook.com/YaoiStage", "title": "Love Stage!! - Yaoi scenes [Ryouma x Izumi]", "publishedDate": "2014-09-18T10:55:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Zqnc2ssNmQ", "description": "Bedelende jongen Lepelaars (Platalea leucorodia) bij een ouder, in het Zandvoortweggebied, op de avond van 25 juli 2014", "title": "Lepelaar ~ Platalea leucorodia ~ Zandvoortweg ~ 2014-07-25", "publishedDate": "2014-08-13T14:04:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ZqrHxaV6mk", "description": "Kayak Angler Magazine checks out the 2014 Outdoor Retailer Open Air Demo.

Yes, we get rain and often times lots of it. \n\nWhen the roof is on hopefully it's installed well enough to protect you, but what about during the process?  What's protecting you then?\n\nMost companies use traditional 30 lb felt paper to protect your home during the re-roof process.  There are a few issues with that however.  Water absorption can be one problem.  Nail penetrations can be another.  The footsteps around the nail or staple penetrations will be stressed causing traditional felt to tear and water leaks for occur.\n\nThe best line of defense is to use a synthetic felt like Diamond Deck from CertainTeed.  Pro Roofing uses Diamond Deck on all CertainTeed roofs we install to maximize the quality of the job.\n\nWe're not kidding when we say we use only premium roofing materials.  Call us for an up close look at the Diamond Deck.  We'll bring a sample to your home and let you see why it's the best roofing felt around.  425.814.7313\n\nFEATURES:\nLightweight -- Easy to work with and carry\nExcellent 6-month UV stability -- Finish the roof when the Seattle weather permits\nExcellent tear resistance -- Durability, reduced puncture risk\nSuperior wet/dry traction -- We can work faster and safer\nCool gray surface color -- More comfortable working environment\n\nCertainTeed's Diamond Deck High Performance Synthetic Underlayment is manufactured to provide best-in-class performance in terms of both weather protection and contractor safety.\n\nDiamond Deck is a synthetic, scrim-reinforced, water-resistant underlayment that can be used beneath shingle, shake, metal or slate roofing.

Thus, the primary goal is maximum relief from pain. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of sustained-release pregabalin and methylcobalamin in reducing neuropathic pain in Indian patients, in the real-life situation.\n\nMethods: This was a multicenter, prospective, open-labeled, single-arm, observational, 14-day study. Patients received fixed dose combination of 75 or 150 mg sustained-release pregabalin combined with 1500 mcg immediate release methylcobalamin, depending on the clinical requirement. Data was collected for pain reduction and other positive and negative symptoms associated with neuropathy, including hyperesthesia, paresthesia, numbness/tingling, burning sensation, muscle weakness, sleep disturbances, and impairment of movement. Pain intensity was measured on a ten-point visual analog scale (VAS) (0 represented \"no pain,\" and 10 represented \"worst pain ever\"). The safety of the drug was also evaluated throughout the study duration. Data was analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.\n\nResults: The overall reduction in mean VAS score over 14 days was 72.3%. The reduction in mean VAS score was significant as early as the first week. Both positive and negative symptoms of peripheral neuropathy were significantly improved in greater than 50% patients within the 2 weeks. Giddiness (4.7%), followed by sedation (3.6%), dizziness (2.9%), drowsiness (2.3%), and nausea (2.3%) were the most commonly observed adverse effects. The overall efficacy and tolerability was rated as good to excellent by greater than 95% of the investigators and patients.\n\nConclusion: Fixed dose combination of sustained-release pregabalin and methylcobalamin significantly reduced neuropathic pain, with significant improvement in both the positive and negative symptoms associated with neuropathy, in Indian patients and was well tolerated.\n\nRead the original research paper here: http://www.dovepress.com/sustained-release-pregabalin-with-methylcobalamin-in-neuropathic-pain--peer-reviewed-article", "title": "Sustained release pregabalin with methylcobalamin in neuropathic pain - Video abstract 45271", "publishedDate": "2013-05-29T01:03:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_1CNUZ44Cw", "description": "\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e13\u0e4c \"\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e36\u0e01\" \u0e08\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e19\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e07\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e36\u0e01\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e07\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49\u0e08\u0e31\u0e01\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a Third Kamikaze\n\u0e08\u0e30\u0e25\u0e38\u0e49\u0e19\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e36\u0e01\u0e0a\u0e27\u0e19\u0e15\u0e37\u0e48\u0e19\u0e40\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e41\u0e04\u0e48\u0e44\u0e2b\u0e19 \u0e44\u0e1b\u0e0a\u0e21\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e43\u0e19 Clip \u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22 !!", "title": "[Behind MV] \u0e2a\u0e31\u0e21\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e13\u0e4c\"\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e36\u0e01\"\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a Third Kamikaze !!", "publishedDate": "2014-08-17T11:40:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_1PWHNQLKU", "description": "No work has begun yet on the Highlands Highway where a major landslip over the weekend stopped all economic movements.\n\nTrucks, people and goods are still stranded on either sides of the highway as landowners demand compensation for works to begin.", "title": "No work yet on Highlands Highway landslip", "publishedDate": "2013-05-08T00:05:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_1ZxQuEETM", "description": "Le Roi Mohammed VI dans les rues de Tunis", "title": "Le Roi Mohammed VI dans les rues de Tunis (1)", "publishedDate": "2014-06-02T16:59:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_23tAp4Gg8", "description": "Divine Comedy's parody of Michael Jackson's \"Bad.\"\n\nSpecial thanks to Natalie Madsen for choreography and her father-in-law for being awesome. \n\nHey!

It does not require complicated instruments . His research work is  by collecting the unused articles around us and applying them as the no cost aid in the teaching learning process or for common man's requirements. The rubbish is  also be collected and used for manifesting the creativity and protecting the milieu. This phenomenon is implemented through an NGO namely SROSTI (Social development research organisation for science, technology and implementation) At/P.O.- Bahanaga in the District of Balasore, Odisha,India which is founded by Mihir during the year 1987. Though he had not got any financial aid or assistance from anybody but the organisation is decorated with thousand and thousands of scientific models, a garden of five acres, a laboratory measuring 150'-0\"x15'-0\" , sophisticated Audiovisual systems, workshop to materialise the thoughts of the children etc. He had a jeep which is used to transport his models to different rural  areas for displaying of  \"simple innovation \" programmefor which he do not accept any fees. Different kinds of new models are built in the workshop by the students under the strong supervision of the resource person of SROSTI. Of course, this laboratory is a living wonder in the realm of science. \nThat, Mihir panda had constantly been rendering service since 1987 to popularize science and mathematics among the millions of students ,teachers and common people through programme \"simple innovation\". He had manufacturing low cost models from the waste and unused materials  & instrumental in changing and enriching the lives of the rest in the society by inculcating a sense of positive attitude in their mind towards science. Being fired by the zeal of dedication and determination Mihir panda had been devoting most of my time and energy for making science easily, accessibly to anybody and everybody. The students who were immensely preoccupied with fear psychosis especially for science and mathematics have tremendously changed their attitude and developed an appetite for learning science and mathematics in a jocund manner.  The simple innovation of Mihir panda had helped the farmers, phycally challanged persons,house wives and for any body.His  hundreds of innovations are  counted for people science.\nAlthough in recognition to his research he had been awarded by different organizations, but it is a matter of regret that, he had not received any financial assistance from any Govt./Non Govt. organization, as a matter of fact he had been passing through a precarious financial position and pressing hard to materialize his noble dream by Playing cheerfully with science and mathematics. \nIn his Laboratory there are more than Thirty Thousand model designs to demonstrate the different experiments of science through Audio-visual class, play way methods to learn science and mathematics, observing natural Bonsai and many more...  for the teachers and students as well   without any fee.", "title": "magic ballon", "publishedDate": "2011-05-08T03:31:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_Ov4Zluufg", "description": "Un feuillage d\u00e9coratif, des formes vari\u00e9es et un entretien facile, voici les principales qualit\u00e9s du dracaena, un arbuste originaire dAfrique tropicale et dAsie.", "title": "Le dracaena - Jardineries Truffaut TV", "publishedDate": "2010-03-26T13:28:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_P-t0idgqI", "description": "Comfortably Numb ( solo ) played by Tina S (15 y.o) played on her Vigier Excalibur Custom.\nFacebook page : https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tina-S/181555232026760?ref=hl\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/Tina_Guitare\nTaught and filmed by her teacher Renaud Louis-Servais ( http://www.youtube.com/renaudls )", "title": "Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb Solo Cover", "publishedDate": "2014-04-28T15:58:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_PfOKqJpak", "description": "Astro Lords is a science-fiction, free-to-play, massively multiplayer online game developed with Unity 3D.

Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) was once a star player on the Richmond High School basketball team in Richmond, CA, and years later, after establishing himself in publishing and marketing, he returns to the school and to the team as the new basketball coach. Carter quickly sees that his work is cut out for him -- the team is having an awful season, and their fights off the court are more decisive than their play on the court. While Carter wants to make the Richmond cagers into a winning team, he also wants a lot more -- to teach the boys to respect themselves and one another, and that they must excel in the classroom as well as in the gymnasium. Under Carter's guidance, the team turns their losing season around, with the state title a genuine possibility. However, when Carter learns that a number of his players have let their grade point averages slip below 2.3, as mandated in a contract he entered into with the students, he decides to lock the team out of the gym and send them into study hall until their marks improve. Carter's plan quickly becomes a subject of controversy among parents and team boosters, and their objections are soon picked up by the local news media, many of whom are not sympathetic to Carter's belief that his players must have goals beyond college ball or the NBA. Coach Carter also features Rob Brown and Rick Gonzalez as members of the team, and R&B diva Ashanti in her film debut as the girlfriend of one of Carter's players.\n\n\"coach carter\",\"coach carter clip\",\"coach carter part 1\",\"coach carter full movie\",\"samuel l jackson\",\"channing tatum\",\"rick gonzalez\",\"rob brown\",\"robert richard\",\"nana gbewonyo\",\"sonya eddy\",\"box videos\",\"pencil videos\",\"sports dramas\",basketball,biography,drama,\"inspirational stories\",\"sports stories\",\"triumph of the underdogs\",\"van toffler\",\"david gale\",\"michael tollin\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++304499,/m/0f5xn,/m/084snt,/m/09knm1,/m/05knq2,/m/087v8v,/m/06lvlf,/m/026y610", "title": "Coach Carter (6/9) Movie CLIP - Our Deepest Fear (2005) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-24T19:56:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_fJY95NDp8", "description": "Resultado positivo da t\u00e9cnica de Woo em c\u00e3o proveniente do Pantanal Sul Mato Grossense.", "title": "T\u00e9cnica de Woo - Trypanosoma evansi", "publishedDate": "2011-02-26T16:09:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_fRgKbivj4", "description": "Romanian National Championships 2014 - Moldovan Paul Adrian - Tatar Cristina - Samba", "title": "Romanian National Championships 2014 - Moldovan Paul Adrian - Tatar Cristina - Samba", "publishedDate": "2014-03-10T12:40:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_fVZWYw8KM", "description": "I love the Scenes..the Boys..and I like the Song.

Up to now it absolutely was mainly type-1 which affected a percentage of children however, due to spread of poor dietary habits, obesity and metabolic syndrome, the incidence of type-2 is on the rise. This was once considered as an adult disease but is no longer considered rare amongst children and young adults. There is a third form of diabetes named MODY which stands for maturity-onset diabetes with the young. This can be different from types 1 and two for the reason that it is a genetically carried condition.\nYou'll find steps you can take to keep your child safe and sound from the risk of diabetes. Here are a few tips:\nYou can keep them active by setting limits on how long they view tv or play online games. Find activities which involve exercise.\n\nAll the family can get involved with physical exercises such as boating, cycling, bowling, pitch-and-put golf. Make it fun and make it regular. \n\nMake dietary changes. Eliminate snacking and introduce quite a lot of vegetables and salad to your meal table. Put out little pots of hummus with colourful strips of red and yellow peppers, crunchy carrot sticks and strips of celery to scoop up the hummus. Cook food in a little olive oil and avoid too much fat on meat. Instead of chips and processed foods such as beef burgers, sausages and chicken nuggets, go for plain roast or fried chicken, home-made fish cakes or lentil and split pea dishes. These types of food are much more nutritious without the fat and sugarthat cause obesity.\n\nProvide a great example. Children discover from their parents and they'll adopt your habits. If your routine is unhealthy theirs shall be too. \n\nSpend time looking at your individual creative solutions. Put on paper your thoughts and ideas and discuss them during those precious moments when all the family are together. Often when people have their say it is simpler to implement new schemes.\n\nRemember, it is never too early to teach children. This is the time they have to learn to be healthy. \nIf your kid already has type-1 or type-2 diabetes, you will understand how important it is to assist them to manage the disease. It can be a stressful issue for parents, dealing with the control of sugar levels, but with a little knowledge and regular monitoring, it can turn into routine that could be performed with minimum hassle. \nOne of the most worrying aspects is recognising indications of hyperglycemia. Regular monitoring will assist you to spot if your child has a pattern of high blood sugar at certain times of the day. You can then adjust the routine to make things more stable.\nIt is hard for a parent to require on frequent blood testing because children will first  resistant to having this done. You may have to be quite clever in deciding on ways to get them to be feel better about it or at least to recognize its importance for their wellbeing. You already know your very own child best and for this reason you'll be the very best person to decide on the tactics to work with. \nDiabetes presents emotional issues to every one, but with children it is very important to look out closely for almost any indication of emotional problems. Most youngsters like to feel the same as their peers; it is understandable that the rigours of managing diabetes may result in situations which cause them to have feelings of \u2018difference.\u2019 \nGive your child or teenager every opportunity to communicate their feeling to you. Bottled-up emotion can lead to depression so encourage them to talk it through. Be understanding; don\u2019t try to make light of their worries. It's so important to let them see you acknowledge their feelings and also their pain.\nFluctuating blood glucose can prevent the brain from dealing rationally with anger. For every person who finds themselves scuffling with a chronic medical problem there's always likely to be a component of frustration. The issue that including the bravest, most long-suffering person, will ask themselves is \u2018why me?\u2019 For a child it is incredibly tough to accept a condition like diabetes. \n\nPLease visit http://cureyourtype2diabetes.com/type2diabetes.html & get detailed information.\n\nThere are serious complications associated with this condition, watch this short video and be in the know. http://youtu.be/_JzcjDFbJgc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx25WBRqIJ9CRs_UvHN5RqQ\n\n\n\nDIABETES SYMPTOMS IN CHILDREN :\n00:00:05  diabetes symptoms in children\n00:00:13  diabetes in children symptoms\n00:00:21  juvenile diabetes\n00:00:29  childhood obesity\n00:00:38  signs of diabetes in children\ndiabetes symptoms in children\nhttp://youtu.be/FNpA9zfM7NI", "title": "diabetes symptoms in children Diabetes kills diabetes symptoms in children", "publishedDate": "2014-08-05T17:43:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_uZ8AZfPTU", "description": "", "title": "Lead India The Tree", "publishedDate": "2013-09-09T21:51:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_vHXejECgc", "description": "http://patrignone.com", "title": "More slug sliminess", "publishedDate": "2013-10-01T14:42:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_vP_DYK-Ys", "description": "Ignite playing Slowdown", "title": "Ignite - Slowdown (acoustic) - Live in Essen", "publishedDate": "2008-05-13T11:33:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_vPm5K9U7A", "description": "Just a shortened clip of the Synesthesia video on youtube, for my psych class.", "title": "Synaesthesia Psychology", "publishedDate": "2007-11-29T18:26:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_vPwgy7y1I", "description": "", "title": "mest Cichlidae", "publishedDate": "2012-03-17T15:07:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_vStueOwyQ", "description": "MusloV Wonosobo Leksono", "title": "Musang Pandan Bonding", "publishedDate": "2014-09-23T13:56:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "2_ve-mNaYmI", "description": "Ultrasound guided Median nerve block\n\nVisit us at www.ra-uk.org - the website of Regional Anaesthesia -United Kingdom (ESRA UK Division)\n\nProduced by the The Nerve imaging Group\n\n\u00a9 Please note all video content is copyrighted and remains the property of The Nerve imaging Group.

I arc welded two \"L\" brackets; one on the top edge of the bead roller and one on the bottom. That added a ton of strength and prevents any flexing during usage. I mig welded some round rod stock that I had to the stand to hold the extra dies. I also re-purposed an electric motor and wired controller that I found on a wheelchair lift that had been sitting in my shed for a few years. I welded brackets to hold the electric chain drive unit to the bead roller. Next, I took an old PC game steering wheel with brake & gas pedal and rewired the pedals to work as a foot controller; the left pedal rolls the metal to the left and the right pedal rolls to the right. I also wired in a 110 AC converter to DC 12 volt to power the 12 volt motor. This bead roller is now better than the $1200 powered units! I spent about $250 and worked on it for about 5 hours.

The Spanish mackerel is a long, large-growing species and requires a different approach than smaller stocky species such as snapper. This same method can also be applied to other large pelagic species such as wahoo, cobia, etc.\n\nIf you've never filleted a Spanish mackerel, follow the steps you see here, pause it if you have to, and with a bit of luck you too will be left with a couple of white meaty fillets just like this. \n\nFor more educational fishing videos head to our website www.getfishing.com.au", "title": "How To Fillet Fish: Spanish Mackerel", "publishedDate": "2013-09-01T03:09:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2a5AICDKs7g", "description": "Buy Shocking Blue ''At Home'' album here : http://itunes.apple.com/nl/album/at-home/id293336477", "title": "Shocking Blue - Venus", "publishedDate": "2010-06-08T14:47:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "2a5RWDg2R3w", "description": "Showing some examples of the genus Copernicia that do well on the Treasure Coast.", "title": "Copernicia alba and baileyana Palms", "publishedDate": "2012-07-16T21:33:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "2a5ZAHmV1DU", "description": "Dillon Francis -  What\u2019s That Spell (Ft.

This is for guys and you wouldn't do this between a male and female. \n\nIt's two kisses on the right cheek and three if you know the person well. If very good friends or if someone comes to respect you then it's a double tap of noses (eskimo style taps). If you are greeting an elder, kiss on the forehead as a sign of respect.\n\nOh and if there are three people in the room, there's no three-way greeting. One on one only!\n\nImportant!! It's two or three on the right cheek for us. Different nationalities tend to switch sides. So to avoid the unintended kiss on the lips, you can hold the persons left arm to ensure the person isn't moving anywhere :)\n\nDo you have a question about Qatari Etiquette and Culture?

Batoids can be divided into two subgroups based on their method of propulsion through the water (for review see Rosenberger 2001): using the body and tail (axial-based locomotion) or large pectoral fins (pectoral fin-based locomotion). Pectoral fin-based locomotion has traditionally been divided into two further categories; oscillation and undulation. Undulation of the pectoral fins is defined by having more than a single wave present on the fins at a time (Webb 1994). Batoid fishes that use this method include most stingrays and skates. By contrast, oscillation of the pectoral fins has less than half a wave on the fins at a time (Webb 1994). This group includes the pelagic rays such as manta, cownose, eagle and bat rays. A recent study by Rosenberger (2001) showed that most species demonstrating pectoral fin-based locomotion fall along a continuum between undulation and oscillation. For example, the southern stingray (Dasyatis americana) exhibits both forms of pectoral fin locomotion determined by swimming behavior and speed. As their velocity increases they shift from the oscillatory to the undulatory form. The following footage shows D. americana exhibiting first undulatory and then oscillatory swimming patterns as they slow down; and the spotted eagle ray (Rhinoptera bonasus) demonstrating only the oscillatory behavior. Of the species studied, Rosenberger (2001) found that R. bonasus was the only species to exhibit strictly oscillatory behavior.\n\nCredits\nCinematography: Dr. Forest Rohwer &\nDr. Stuart Sandin\nEdited by: Neilan Kuntz\nWritten by: Neilan Kuntz\nLocation: Borneo, Malaysia (Sipadan) (2003)\nPalmyra Atoll, Line Islands, Central Pacific (2004)\n\nRosenberger, L.J.

First and foremost, it's really important to remember that not all parrots talk. A lot of people buy a parrot and they're disappointed to find out that that bird does nothing but make noise or that it never learns to say a single word. You've got to get a parrot because you enjoy having a bird and enjoy the way that they are, not just because you want a talking companion. \n\nKeep in mind that parrots don't have a mute button like a TV. So, you get a parrot that you want to talk and maybe it will talk all day long, maybe it will scream all day long. You've got to be able to accept the noise and accept that the talking might just never come to them. \n\nThat said, some parrots do learn to talk very well. First, they learn to talk on their own. They learn by listening to things. So, the first thing you can do to encourage it to talk is to talk to the bird. Keep in mind that the words and phrases you use are all up for repetition. So, don't say things to your parrot that you wouldn't want it to say back. \n\nTo encourage your parrot to say specific phrases, pick five or ten phrases that you really want your parrot to repeat and try to say them on a regular basis. Try to talk to your parrot when it is in a heightened state. That's usually when their eyes are pinning or they're attentive. Oftentimes, this is when you just walk in the door, the parrots are excited. The first thing that most parrots learn to say is hello because that's the first thing that they hear whenever someone walks into a room, and that's when they're excited to see someone new. \n\nSome parrots talk in a more calm environment when they think no one's looking. African grays, Capes and other parrots like that are more shy and will tend to talk in their cages. Meanwhile, some other parrots are more bold and love the attention. Amazons and cockatoos are more prone to talking in person and for attention instead. \n\nLastly, you can try to capture your parrot's vocalizations on cue. The way to get your parrot to say what it says when you want it to say it is to capture it on cue using a clicker. Whenever you hear your parrot saying the phrase that it learned that you want it to say, click the clicker and go and give it a treat. \n\nOver time, the parrot's going to learn to say that phrase more and more often. What you're going to try to do is predict when your parrot's going to say it, and say your cue. For example, if you want to say \"hello\" and you want your parrot to say \"what'cha doing\" in return, whenever your parrot says, \"what'cha doing\" respond with \"hello\" and then give it a treat. Over time, since it's going to be saying it over and over again, first you say 'hello' and if it responds back with \"what'cha doing\" you can go and give it the treat. \n\nIf it doesn't, then keep saying 'hello' until is says the response and then you'll have the reason to click and give it a treat. Just remember, not all parrots are going to learn to talk. However, the more you talk to them, the better their chances of picking some talking up are.", "title": "How to Teach Your Parrot to Talk | Parrot Training", "publishedDate": "2013-09-10T12:34:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "2aRqIGeqQsI", "description": "Varnam\nRaga Ananda bhairavi / Thala Adi\n\nComposer: Tanjore Ponniah Pillai\nChoreographer: Sivanandam and Rukmini Devi\nNayaki:Virahotkandida\nNayaka: Anukulan\n \n\"Oh friend!

Winters Company offers plumbing, heating, cooling. If you need service today; we're the business to call. My website is wintershomeservices.com. I'll be talking to you today about plumbing. \n\nHow you go to the plumbing business? I can tell you about my personal experience. And I am master plumber in Commonwealth of Massachusetts. We serve right now a three year apprenticeship back when I become a plumber. Now, it's a five year apprenticeship. So, when apprentice is somebody that is going to work on the direction of a master plumber or licensed plumber for that time period and teach him or her how to install things correctly by code. And how to install fixture, plumbings, piping, etc. all to coat.\n\nOnce, they are an apprentice, a registered apprentice, they are eligible to attend school. And they have to attend school for extra amount of hundred of hours. So, we have practical, and then, we have written examinations that we go through at the end of that apprenticeship.\n\nAt the end of apprenticeship, you have to take a test. Usually, it's a state proctored exam lasting anywhere from to four to six hours. And once, you have taken that exam, you find out at that point if you become a licensed plumber. Once you become a licensed plumber then you have to work in the field as a licensed plumber to become a master plumber which is what I am.\n\nFirst thing here, I believe everyone needs to do is take a lot of business courses, accounting especially. Accounting courses, learning how to price things, learning how to become a profitable business because without profit, you go to be, your business is going to be out really soon.\"", "title": "How to Become a Plumber | Plumbing Repairs", "publishedDate": "2011-06-09T19:40:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "2aVLvj28eD8", "description": "", "title": "Coturnice (Alectoris graeca)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-18T21:42:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "2aVMUm20uw4", "description": "Le ministre de l'Economie, Pierre Moscovici, a estim\u00e9 n'avoir commis \"aucune faute\" et a r\u00e9cus\u00e9 mercredi 3 avril la moindre \"complaisance\" ou \"volont\u00e9 d'entraver la justice\" de la part de Bercy ou du gouvernement dans l'affaire Cahuzac.

Alice In THunderdome is Rob's sixth full length album and third solo album. Almost six years has passed since his last full length and as you will see, a lot has changed since then. He spent much of his time away touring and working on the album, as well as releasing an album with Aesop Rock as a member of the group Hail Mary Mallon.\n\nSome of what you\u2019ve come to expect from Rob Sonic remains, dense word play, \u201cheavy-electric\u201d beats and a unique approach to Rapping are all present and accounted for. The familiarity however, may end there for some, as Rob approaches this album in an entirely different and new way, there is nothing that tries to be Trendy or friendly about this album, it approaches you, introduces itself and immediately gets down to Brass Tacks.\n\nThe record has extremely personal touches strategically situated on a canvas of pure aggression, it's as if Rob is offering your senses a truce and launches an attack before they can agree, as high as Rob wants you to get, is as low as you can go, which is after all how many of us live our lives, or at least at some point or another have, we\u2019ve gone in to the Rabbit hole and come out in the wastelands.\n\nRob is not another Hero\n\nAnd Alice In Thunderdome is not just another record.\ncredits\nreleased 26 August 2014\n\nAlice In Thunderdome (Full Credits)\n\n1.

(c) J-Lynne Records, Inc. 2012. Receive love, relationship advice and inspiration through song. \n\nJennifer Lang releases \"Hi\" as her next music video from her latest album \"3'0 Clock Saturday\" in her usual soulful stylings reminiscent of an early Anita Baker.  As a follow up to the \"Fairy Tales\" video, this latest endeavor is a hopeful song about the possibilities of new romance.\n\nJennifer Lang reminds us of that first spark that occurs when we first meet the eyes of that attractive \"someone\" from across a crowded room.  Her sensual vocals act almost like a musical version of our inner thoughts, wondering what the other person is thinking and if this could be \"the one\".\n\n\"Hi\" is a smooth flowing tune that can be very addictive.  The words in the song make you think and reflect on past relationships and encounters, how the physical beauty is the initial appeal which only draws our focus toward the inner being of the person when a true love connection has been made.  \n\nNot since Alicia Keys has an artist been so successful at story telling with a message.  Given another less talented artist, the song could come off a bit \"preachy\" or condescending, but Ms. Lang pulls it off as if she can read our very minds.  \n\nThe music video incorporates beautiful time lapsed footage of many of the famous New York City landmarks taken at night with colorful lights and interesting interactions of potential lovers.  It's easy to remember those first feelings and excitement of dating someone new because the video perfectly matches the words and message of the song's lyrics without drawing your attention away from Jennifer's vocals.\n\n3 O' Clock Saturday is an eclectic grouping of 14 songs that are easy to listen to, either alone or with the one you love.  It's the sort of artistic achievement that we haven't heard since Anita Baker's \"Rapture\" album where every song is a masterpiece and every track tells a story.  From the thought provoking \"Hi\" to the upbeat \"Jenny's Groove\", each selection is layered with thought provoking lyrics and power vocals that leave you wanting more.\n\n3 O' Clock Saturday, along with Jennifer Lang's Debut album, \"Just a Lang Thang\", are being offered on Amazon, eMusic, and iTunes.  Click here to purchase her latest achievement  http://www.JlynneRecords.net\n\nhttp://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lang3\n\nLyrics:\n\nChorus:Hi, what do you see? When you look at me tell me what do you see? Hi, What do you think? When you look at me tell me what do you think? If I just went by looks, you'd have me shook. (v1) If I just went by sight. I'd love you with all of my might.Repeat Chorus (v2) You talk real smooth, I guess you'll make your move. You sound sincere, you're trying to pull me near. There's more to a man than flesh and blood, the soul of a man is key. His mind, his thoughts, what does he want, that's what, you've gotta see.

In the United Kingdom, former British colonies, and the United States a Victorian house generally means any house built during the reign of Queen Victoria (1837--1901). \n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution successive housing booms resulted in the building of many millions of Victorian houses which are now a defining feature of most British towns and cities.\n\nIn the UK, Victorian houses follow a wide range of architectural styles. Starting from the early classicism inherited from Regency architecture, the Italianate style gained influence in the 1840s and 1850s, and the Gothic style became prevalent by the 1880s. \n\nLater in the Victorian era, the Queen Anne style and the Arts and Crafts movement increased in influence, resulting in the transition to styles typically seen in Edwardian houses. \n\nVictorian houses are also found in many former British colonies where the style might be adapted to local building materials or customs, for example in Sydney, Australia and Melaka, Malaysia.\n\nIn the United States, Victorian house styles include Second Empire, Queen Anne, Stick (and Eastlake Stick), Shingle, Richardsonian Romanesque, and others.\n\nVictorian Houses - description courtesy of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_house\n\n\nvisit our website  http://weathertightroofinginc.com\ncontact us  http://www.weathertightroofinginc.com/Roofing-Specialists-Contact-Us-Hemet-CA.html\nlike us on Facebook  https://www.facebook.com/WeathertightRoofing\nfollow us on Pinterest  http://pinterest.com/weathertight\nfollow us on Twitter  https://twitter.com/WeathertightRoo\nsubscribe to our Youtube channel  http://www.youtube.com/user/WeathertightHemet\nadd us on Google+   https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/116501500045980587313/116501500045980587313/posts#116501500045980587313/posts\n\nWeathertight Roofing\n1100 N.

The name derives from the Latin for turnip, r\u0101pa or r\u0101pum, and is first recorded in English at the end of the 14th century. Older writers usually distinguished the turnip and rape by the adjectives 'round' and 'long' (-'rooted'), respectively. Rutabagas, Brassica napobrassica, are sometimes considered a variety of B. napus. Some botanists also include the closely related B. campestris within B. napus.\n\nB. napus is cultivated mainly for its oil-rich seed, the third-largest source of vegetable oil in the world.\n\nRapeseed oil is used as diesel fuel, either as biodiesel, straight in heated fuel systems, or blended with petroleum distillates for powering motor vehicles. Biodiesel may be used in pure form in newer engines without engine damage and is frequently combined with fossil-fuel diesel in ratios varying from 2% to 20% biodiesel. Owing to the costs of growing, crushing, and refining rapeseed biodiesel, rapeseed-derived biodiesel from new oil costs more to produce than standard diesel fuel, so diesel fuels are commonly made from the used oil. Rapeseed oil is the preferred oil stock for biodiesel production in most of Europe, accounting for about 80% of the feedstock, partly because rapeseed produces more oil per unit of land area compared to other oil sources, such as soybeans, but primarily because canola oil has a significantly lower gel point than most other vegetable oils. About 66% of total rapeseed oil supply in the European Union was expected to be used for biodiesel production in the 2010-2011 year.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Part of their style is inspired by Nindo traditional dance. The group sings in Kigogo, swahili and have even tried out a little English. Nyuki Mautya is hoping to do more of their work and maybe travel a little to other regions, but are limited by their funding. So if you are interested in helping them out to buy some uniforms and help them share their music, please contact Semeni Tondoka (Current leader, swahili only) at: (Within Tanzania) 0757264435, (or from outside Tanzania)  +255 757264435. English speakers can also email ryanfmason@gmail.com.\n\nNyuki Mautya Belelga Kongwa ni kikundi cha kucheza ngoma za asili kilichopo katika kijiji cha Mautya, wilaya ya  Kongwa Tanzania. Kikundi hicho kilianzishwa toka mwaka 1981, kimekuwa kikitumia mashairi ya nyimbo zao kuelimisha jamii juu ya UKIMWI, ukeketaji wa wanawake, malaria na mambo mengine yanayohusu jamii.

It belongs to the octopus family Octopodidae. It can be commonly found in amongst rubble in the sponge gardens and seagrass beds of coastal estuaries where they can be found hiding in their lair. The lair of the species is easily identified by the bivalve shells that are scattered around its entrance. Divers will often see the octopus with their head protruding from the lair and the octopus will retreat down its burrow if it feels threatened. The species can also be found on rocky coastal reefs to depths of 40 metres.\nThe Sydney Octopus feeds on shellfish. It drills through the shell and poisons the contents, pulls the shell apart and then eats the paralysed contents. It is more active at night as it will leave its lair and search the surrounds for crustaceans and shellfish to feed on. A favourite food source of the Sydney Octopus is rock lobster, especially small juvenile lobsters. The Sydney Octopus can be easily identified by its white eye and it is generally grey to brown in colour with orange arms. The species can grow quite large with an armspan that reaches more than 2 metres.", "title": "Exploring a Sydney Octopus by TBD Team", "publishedDate": "2011-07-12T13:16:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "2b3-OYp2I-E", "description": "Click for subscribe to channel : http://www.youtube.com/user/AutoportMagazine\n\nThe all-new 2015 Volkswagen Golf Sportsvan.

God is my favorite song...ever.\n\nJohn Lennon/Plastic Ono Band is the debut solo album by John Lennon. It was released in 1970 after Lennon issued three experimental albums with Yoko Ono and Live Peace in Toronto 1969, a live performance in Toronto credited to The Plastic Ono Band. The album was recorded simultaneously with Yoko Ono's debut avant garde solo album Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band at Ascot Sound Studios and Abbey Road Studios using the same musicians and production team, and featured nearly identical cover artwork. John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band is generally considered one of Lennon's finest solo albums and a landmark recording. Rolling Stone named it the twenty-second greatest album of all time.\n\n\"Plastic Ono Band\" refers to the conceptual band Lennon and Ono had formed in 1969 of various supporting musicians they would use on their various solo albums.\n \nAfter the Beatles' break-up in April 1970, both Lennon and Ono undertook primal therapy with the guidance of Arthur Janov for four months in Los Angeles. Janov's therapy technique emphasized emotionally reliving repressed childhood traumas rather than analytical discussion. Lennon's experience in primal therapy strongly influenced both the lyrical content of the album, pushing Lennon towards themes of child-parent relationships and psychological suffering, and the simple but intense style of the album's music.\n \nReturning to England that September, Lennon and Ono called upon Phil Spector, who had produced Lennon's hit \"Instant Karma!\" earlier that year, to co-produce both the albums with them at Abbey Road Studios.\n \nThroughout the album, Lennon touches upon many personal issues: his abandonment by his parents in \"Mother\"; the castigation of class issues in \"Working Class Hero\"; a reminder that despite his rage and pain, Lennon still embraces \"Love\"; and \"God\", a renouncement of external saviours. Here Lennon states that he believes only in himself, and his wife Yoko.\n \nPhil Spector, a co-producer on this album, played piano on \"Love\". Lennon and Ono produced the album largely on their own, as Spector was unavailable during most of the recording sessions. Lennon even went so far as to post an ad in Billboard magazine inviting Phil to come visit him for the weekend.\n \n\"Look at Me\" dates from The Beatles period, and is built on a finger-picking guitar pattern very similar to the one Lennon used in \"Dear Prudence\", \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\" and \"Julia\". Lennon learned this guitar technique from Donovan while the two were in Rishikesh. The album was released in Japan under the title \u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9b42 (John no Tamashii?), which translates as \"John's Soul\".\n \nIn 2000, Yoko Ono supervised a remixing of John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band for its remastered CD reissue, including two bonus tracks: Lennon's 1971 hit \"Power to the People\" and \"Do the Oz", "title": "John Lennon-\"Isolation\" from the 2000 remastered version of \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\"", "publishedDate": "2011-11-02T02:20:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "2b6E7s6V11M", "description": "", "title": "Littoral : un homme meurt noy\u00e9 \u00e0 Biarritz", "publishedDate": "2014-10-20T16:29:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2b6Ulu-KoUM", "description": "In loving memory of my beautiful and amazing friend, Talia Castellano..

After 35 years of research, Dr.Pichaet, chairman and CEO of Asian Phytoceuticals disclose during a press conference on Monday that the beneficial effects of the fruit are due to the substance known as GM-1. Doses of GM-1have been proven to be capable to balance the body's immune system and in turn making it stronger against pain, fever, inflammation, diarrhea, infection, ulcer and cancer. In 2008 Dr. Pichaet lead a scientific team at The Mangosteen Research and Development Center Thailand to conduct Operation BIM. As a result the new BIM formula has been prepared using extracts of five kinds of Thai fruit and grain claim to help boost the activation of T Helper cell which plays an important role in establishing and maximizing the capability of the immune system. Experiences conducted with volunteers have conclusively proven that the patented BIM product significantly increases cancer patient's life expectancy and improve their quality of life. Test carried out in laboratory and on test subjects in Thailand as well as in partnering countries such as the USA and Italy have yielded satisfactory results. The 3 studies have conclusively supported each other that the quality of life of people suffering from cancer definitely has improved. As in some case the life expectancy has been increased significantly. http://www.healthychoice.in.th/Health-testimonial/Last-Stage-Cancer.html\nhttp://www.bim100ka.com/", "title": "Thai Scientists Unveil Mangosteen Anti Cancer Properties", "publishedDate": "2013-11-02T14:16:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "2b6ryp7nMFc", "description": "John van Den Brandt is a wildlife photographer and the owner of Wild Wind Images, based in Appleton, WI.

We routinely use the Kattan Memorial Sloan Kettering prostate cancer nomogram to counsel our patient's risk of extracapsular disease (http://www.mskcc.org/applications/nomograms/prostate/)\n\nA positive surgical margin (PSM) occurs when prostate cancer cells are observed at the edge of the specimen, impyling that cancer cells remain in the patient. This pathological finding increases the risk of disease recurrence identified by a detectable and rising PSA after surgery. A PSM is the only recurrence risk factor that is related to the surgeon and his technique. The most important factor to minimize this risk is surgical experience. There is a litany of data to suppor that surgeon \"expertise\" defined as a surgeon who has performed more than 300 robotic procedures leads to the optimal cancer-free outcomes. As such, we generally counsel patients seeking robotic surgery to search for a surgeon with over 250-300 case experience.
