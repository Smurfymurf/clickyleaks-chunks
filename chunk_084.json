The film introduces us to a father and his son; the older man is obese, unwell, and oppressive in his dealings with the younger, who is also deaf and mute. A series of cryptic, spellbinding episodes reveals a tyrannical paternalism at work that has long since hardened into a closed circuit of mutual pain. Enter a mysterious and beautiful woman of unspecified identity, who becomes an agent of change, embodying both an evolved consciousness and the power of the female as a rebuke to bankrupt patriarchy.\n\nCharacteristically experimenting with film form, Shirvani is rigorous and masterful in his storytelling here, introducing situations and behaviors without qualification so that minute details surge with symbolic weight. Sensitively modulated sound and searching camerawork extract telling clues from myriad strata while the implied narrative attaches to the powerfully realized, archetypical characters like a vapor. - Shannon Kelly", "title": "FAT SHAKER Trailer", "publishedDate": "2013-01-16T03:14:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Fy7w68u_hA", "description": "Seen from the Mannheim Road overpass, two Union Pacific SD40-2s work switching in the massive Proviso Yard.

Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers were all discussed. All have a role to play, and all attack high blood pressure at different places in the body\u2019s process of maintaining blood pressure. Often, combinations must be used to control high blood pressure. This vignette will further discuss different types of medications that are available to control high blood pressure.\n\nThe next kind of medicine to control high blood pressure is the calcium channel blockers. They are further divided into two different groups: one that opens up the arteries of that lowering the blood pressure inside such as nifedipine and amlodipine, and one that lowers the heart rate such as Verapamil or Diltiazem. These medications are not really considered first-line therapies, but at times they do have a role to play in lowering blood pressure. Verapamil and Diltiazem are also used in certain heart rhythms when the heart rhythm is too fast. The good news with these medications is that there is increasing evidence that they may reduce stroke and heart attacks. However, they do have side effects including headache and swelling in the legs, and of course there\u2019s always a chance that the heart rate can be lowered too much,  causing heart failure or just general fatigue.\n\nAngiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are a new kind of blood pressure medicine that are being used more and more. They work in a similar way to the ACE inhibitors. They differ in that they do not cause a cough, and so many physicians use this type of medication when the ACE inhibitors cause a cough. This kind of medication includes Losartan, Olmesartan, Eprosartan, Telmisartan, Candesartan, Valsartan, and Irbesartan. It is now thought that they have similar effects on heart failure, kidney disease and heart attacks that ACE inhibitors have, although there are not as many studies done on ARBs as there are on the ACE inhibitors. On a more personal note, I very rarely use these medications because of their high costs and to me personally, they just don\u2019t seem very strong in actually reducing high blood pressure.\n\nThere are several other classes of medication that are used less frequently. For instance, in very high blood pressures, some doctors use a medication called hydralazine that helps open the arteries up a bit allowing the pressure inside the artery to decrease. This medication is used three times a day, and often causes lots of swelling in the legs. Furthermore, not everyone responds to it.  There is also a class of high blood pressure medicines called alpha blockers, such as doxazosin, that actually increase the risk of stroke and heart failure when used.\n\nFinally, there probably needs to be a special word given to the medication called clonidine. Clonidine or Catapress is available as a pill or a patch. It\u2019s considered a pretty strong medication, and is one that used a lot when blood pressures are very high, especially if we think somebody is at or near a stroke or kidney failure. It is not used very often long-term because of its two main side effects: it\u2019s very sedating, and it gives a very dry mouth. Both of these symptoms get a little better over time, but for most people they never completely get used to them, either.\n\nAs one can see, there are a lot of choices out there for high blood pressure, and this vignette just scratches the surface. If you have high blood pressure, please consult your physician as to what to do, but we hope that the information above gives you a little bit more information as to how we approach and treat high blood pressure.", "title": "The Treatment Of High Blood Pressure II", "publishedDate": "2014-09-27T21:05:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "4GBKE9KOL8Y", "description": "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8aac\u660e\u306f\u7701\u7565\u3002\n\nHARD ROCK\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\uff08\u5fdc\u63f4\u56e3\u7684\u306b\u306f\u30c1\u30a2\u306e\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\uff09\u3067\u306eMakes No Difference\u30d5\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30dc\u30fbS\u30e9\u30f3\u30af\u3067\u3059\u3002\n3\u3064\uff08100\u00d73\uff09\u843d\u3061\u3002\n\n\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb300\u304c\u53d6\u308c\u305f\u3089\u6d88\u53bb\u30fb\u66f4\u65b0\u3059\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\n...\u3057\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002", "title": "Elite Beat Agents \"Makes No Difference\" Divas S Rank", "publishedDate": "2006-11-13T15:58:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4GBjOT4cXt4", "description": "*", "title": "The Mad Cow Barn", "publishedDate": "2012-08-03T18:59:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "4GC3Y0DeKQY", "description": "Another video from Canadian MGTOW.

Herpes is a sexually transmitted disease. It mainly occurs when the infected skin comes in contact with a herpes free skin. The virus of Herpes gets transferred. More than 50 percentage of people suffer from this problem and the worst part is most of them are unaware that they have got herpes. This is because in most cases Herpes Virus doesn't show any symptom so people are unaware of it even though they might have it inside. Normally doctors give antiviral as cure to Herpes but it never cures it. It just suppresses it for the time being and when you stop using it, Herpes virus are activated again. \n\nIn this video we will show you that there is a natural herpes treatment program which can help you get rid of Herpes completely. It is a permanent Herpes Solution. It has been developed by Sarah Willokx who herself suffered from Herpes at one time of her life. When she got no satisfactory solution to it she decided to take matter into her own hand and did a research about herpes problem. She studied many ancient books about herpes and came up with a complete & natural solution to herpes. She tested it on herself and she got rid of herpes. Then she decided to go one step further and help others like her who are suffering from this major problem.\n\n It's not that doctors and medical world is unaware about it, but they don't let people know because most of these solutions are cheap. This is block there profit percentage and thus reduce their income significantly. This is the prime reason they hide it from you.

There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "How to Get Rid of Eczema - Stop Suffering and Get Your Clear and Beautiful Skin Back", "publishedDate": "2014-01-28T11:09:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "4GKAtDf5HZs", "description": "a fan cable's loose ends look like the missing connections in every meaningless hookup  in lincoln clarkes unplugged   the lovedoctor's spectrographic treatment of lincoln's business like sleeve resembles the myriad appearances a high realist like canada's clarkes deconstructs in powerful photographs", "title": "lincoln clarkes unplugged", "publishedDate": "2013-12-26T22:30:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "4GKdwCGc6UM", "description": "A train engineer is missing after his train derailed on Thursday morning into the Moisie River in Quebec. \n\nThe train was towing three locomotives and 240 railcars, many of them empty, CBC News reported, when a landslide is believed to have pushed it off the tracks and caused it to plunge into the river.\n\nAccording to the Quebec Environment Ministry\u2019s emergency team, the accident also caused the locomotive to spill diesel into the Moisie River for hours after it ran off the tracks. \n\nThe locomotive\u2019s reservoir could carry up to 18,000 litres of fuel, but it is not clear how much fuel was in the tank at the time of the accident.

Osborne\nScreenwriter: Don Mancini, John Lafia, Tom Holland\nFilm Description: Child's Play seems to have been concocted by a parent who went berserk after standing in line for hours on end to purchase a Cabbage Patch doll in the early 1980s. The film opens with serial killer Brad Dourif taking refuge in a doll factory. Dourif is killed by the cops, but not before he has invoked a voodoo curse which transfers his soul into one of the dolls. That particular doll, nicknamed Chuckie, is unwittingly purchased by Catherine Hicks for her son Alex Vincent. Several murders occur shortly thereafter; all evidence points to Alex, who insists that his cherub-faced doll is responsible. Detective Chris Sarandon, the man responsible for Dourif's death, doesn't swallow Alex's story, but he agrees to investigate because he's sweet on Alex's mom. The slasher-flick ending of Child's Play would seem to have settled Chuckie's hash for good and all, but guess again--the film spawned numerous sequels.\n\n\"child's play\",\"child's play clip\",\"child's play full movie\",\"child's play 3\",\"child's play trailer\",\"child's play 2 full movie\",\"child's play 3 full movie\",\"laura moskowitz\",\"alex vincent\",horror,\"syringe videos\",\"tom holland\",\"david kirschner\",\"elliot geisinger\",\"evil videos\",\"scalpel videos\",\"hospital videos\",\"andy barclay\",\"barrie m osborne\",\"dr ardmore\",\"jack colvin\",\"slashers and serial killers\",\"cult horror\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9230,/m/0975xp,/m/0696j1", "title": "Child's Play (8/12) Movie CLIP - Frying the Doctor (1988) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-10-21T21:04:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "4GUsEj7-C1c", "description": "Have you experienced issues connecting to multiplayer matches?\n\nNews By: Meg Turney\nHosted By: Meg Turney\nMusic By: @EvGres at EpicWins.com\n\nFollow The Know on Twitter: http://twitter.com/RT_TheKnow\nFollow The Know on Facebook: http://facebook.com/RT.TheKnow\n\nRT Store: http://bit.ly/1rH5ixT \nRooster Teeth: http://roosterteeth.com/ \nAchievement Hunter: http://achievementhunter.com\nSubscribe to the RT Channel: http://bit.ly/13y3Gum\nSubscribe to the Let's Play Channel: http://bit.ly/11ac5D0\nSubscribe to The Know Channel: http://bit.ly/1kCYEoz\nSubscribe to the Slow Mo Guys Channel: http://bit.ly/OqINYx\nSubscribe to the Game Fails Channel: http://bit.ly/15RbCXV", "title": "Halo: The Master Chief Collection Multiplayer Having Problems - The Know", "publishedDate": "2014-11-11T18:44:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "4GVEUPeg9wg", "description": "A short film honoring Jimmy Shendo", "title": "Walking The Life  Road", "publishedDate": "2010-07-26T15:22:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "4GVGwTXjwbA", "description": "no one saw what was about to happen.                                    \n                                            \n                                                                \n                                                              \n                                                                 \n                                                                 \n                               ....................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Note!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I built the whole thing, not using a preexisting refrigeration device, like a cryocooler. A compressor is used to get the air to 320 atmospheres. I pre-cool it and then send it through a regenerative cooling tower. I throttle the gas and got a small amount of liquid air. The entire cooling process took about 1.5 hours from an ambient temperature of 50F.  The temperature of the liquid air was about -315F using an RTD thermomemter.  I plan to modify this to get a better yield. If viewers express an interest I will make a tutorial page outlining exactly how I built this.

The species has been successfully introduced to many parts of the world for shooting, including vast areas of North America, where it is most commonly known as Hungarian partridge, or just \"Hun\". Widespread and common throughout its large range, the Grey Partridge is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This partridge breeds on farmland across most of Europe into western Asia, and has been introduced widely into North America. They are common in some areas of southern Canada and the northern United States.\n\nThe Grey Partridge is a rotund bird, 28--32 cm (11--13 in) long, brown-backed, with grey flanks and chest. The belly is white, usually marked with a large chestnut-brown horse-shoe mark in males, and also in many females. Hens lay up to twenty eggs in a ground nest. The nest is usually in the margin of a cereal field, most commonly Winter wheat. The only major and constant difference between the sexes is the so-called cross of Lorraine on the tertiary coverts of females -- these being marked with two transverse bars, as opposed to the one in males. These are present after around 16 weeks of age when the birds have moulted into adult plumage. Young Grey Partridges are mostly yellow-brown and lack the distinctive face and underpart markings. The song is a harsh kieerr-ik, and when disturbed, like most of the gamebirds, it flies a short distance on rounded wings, often calling rick rick rick as it rises. They are a seed-eating species, but the young in particular take insects as an essential protein supply. During the first 10 days of life, the young can only digest insects. The parents lead their chicks to the edges of cereal fields, where they can forage for insects. They are also a non-migratory terrestrial species, and form flocks outside the breeding season. Though common and not threatened, it appears to be declining in numbers in some areas of intensive cultivation such as Great Britain, probably due to a loss of breeding habitat and possibly food supplies. Their numbers have fallen in these areas by as much as 85% in the last 25 years. Efforts are being made in Great Britain by organizations such as the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust to halt this decline by creating Conservation headlands. In 1995, it was nominated a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species. In Ireland, it is now virtually confined to the Lough Boora reserve in County Offaly where a recent conservation project has succeeded in boosting its numbers to 900, raising hopes that it may be reintroduced to the rest of Ireland.\n\nThe Jungle Bush Quail, or Perdicula asiatica is a species of quail found in Indian Subcontinent, ranging across India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nVery different from the female, the male jungle bush quail has a white moustache, heavily barred white underparts, and variegated wings. The female has a uniform, rich chestnut breast and belly. However, both the male and the female have red and white streaks on the head. It is roughly 6.3--7.2 in (16--18 cm) in length and weighs 2--2.85 oz (57--81 g).\n\nThe diet of the jungle bush quail consists mainly of seeds. particularly of grasses, although it also takes insects. Breeding takes place after the rains and lasts until the onset of colder weather, with the precise period varying across the range; five or six eggs are produced and incubation takes between 16 and 18 days. The species is not globally threatened as it has an extensive range and tends to avoid agricultural areas. The population in Sri Lanka has contracted since the 1950s, but is thought to be widespread and common elsewhere in the range.\n\nThe jungle bush quail is largely sedentary, although the birds in Nepal are thought to migrate in winter.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

State House Majority Leader and Republican Mike Turzai gave a recent hint, saying the new law \"is gonna allow Gov.

For your consideration.\n\n\n\"Millennium left a very deep impression in its first season. It set the tone firstly as a detective and crime series that looks at the nature of evil. It had strong biblical references with a darker tone, debating between the spiritual and psychological nature. I wanted to revisit that aspect, (before Glen Morgan and James Wong's character and mythology development) which made it compelling, even for a lay-viewer. I did not want to confuse the audience with the Millennium Group's conspiracy aspect. I wanted to see Frank fall into temptation and possibly take up Legion's offer to avenge all the wrongdoings that has befallen him (death of Catherine and maybe even Jordan's). It has been a theme that has been touched many times throughout the series and at the end of Season 1, though the timeline is after Season 3 or the apocryphal Season 4 & 5. I wanted to see if Frank a man of principle, a modern-day Job would at the end of the movie - find his way to triumph that temptation.\"\n\n\nCreator\nChris Carter\n\nCast\nLance Henriksen  ...

It was once believed that the nerve was compressed in the opening from the inside to the outside of the skull; but newer leading research indicates that it is an enlarged blood vessel - possibly the superior cerebellar artery - compressing or throbbing against the microvasculature of the trigeminal nerve near its connection with the pons. Such a compression can injure the nerve's protective myelin sheath and cause erratic and hyperactive functioning of the nerve. This can lead to pain attacks at the slightest stimulation of any area served by the nerve as well as hinder the nerve's ability to shut off the pain signals after the stimulation ends. This type of injury may rarely be caused by an aneurysm (an outpouching of a blood vessel); by a tumor; by an arachnoid cyst in the cerebellopontine angle; or by a traumatic event such as a car accident or even a tongue piercing.\n\nShort-term peripheral compression is often painless, with pain attacks lasting no more than a few seconds. Persistent compression results in local demyelination with no loss of axon potential continuity. Chronic nerve entrapment results in demyelination primarily, with progressive axonal degeneration subsequently. It is, \"therefore widely accepted that trigeminal neuralgia is associated with demyelination of axons in the gasserion ganglion, the dorsal root, or both.\" It has been suggested that this compression may be related to an aberrant branch of the superior cerebellar artery that lies on the trigeminal nerve. Further causes, besides an aneurysm, multiple sclerosis or cerebellopontine angle tumor, include: a posterior fossa tumor, any other expanding lesion or even brainstem diseases from strokes.\n\nA large portion of multiple sclerosis patients have TN, but is not a symptom of MS. Only two to four percent of patients with TN,[citation needed] usually younger, have evidence of multiple sclerosis, which may damage either the trigeminal nerve or other related parts of the brain. It has been theorized that this is due to damage to the spinal trigeminal complex. Trigeminal pain has a similar presentation in patients with and without MS.\n\nPostherpetic Neuralgia, which occurs after shingles, may cause similar symptoms if the trigeminal nerve is damaged.\n\nWhen there is no [apparent] structural cause, the syndrome is called idiopathic.", "title": "Trigeminal Neuralgia", "publishedDate": "2012-09-30T02:21:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "4HnjyJEXO00", "description": "\u4f11\u65e5\u306e\u671d\u3001\u98fc\u3044\u4e3b\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u5bdd\u574a\u3057\u305f\uff2d\uff29\uff38\u732b\u30df\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\uff081\u624d\u7537\u5b50\uff09\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0http://ameblo.jp/hikaiti/", "title": "\u304a\u3075\u3068\u3093\u3067\u304a\u306d\u307c\u3046\u732b\u3000Cat doze in the futon", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T12:16:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "4HoRUxR-bdY", "description": "", "title": "URL Rewrite - Windows Server 2008 - IIS 7 - Install and Configure Rules", "publishedDate": "2012-03-13T05:53:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Hos_xeIIWk", "description": "Beautiful old city center full with Fachwerk hauser and  churches\n\nMusic Smartsound royalty free library\nAlbum Urban Drama track Breaking bonds\nCamera Sony HDR 730", "title": "Korbach Germany Hanseatic League City", "publishedDate": "2014-07-03T11:11:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Hp-FzGUh3g", "description": "Syphilitic Abortion no 4\u00ba Blasphemic Art Festival 12/04/2014\n Na Sede dos Ex Alunos do La Salle Carazinho/RS\n1.

Die Zaunwinde ist eine typische Schlingpflanze, die ihre St\u00fctze mit einem spiralf\u00f6rmigen Wachstum umwindet. Der deutsche Name dieser Pflanze weist auf einen typischen Standort der Zaunwinde hin, man findet sie oftmals in G\u00e4rten an den die Grundst\u00fccke umgebenden Z\u00e4unen und Hecken. Da sich die Pflanze schnell vermehrt und gr\u00f6\u00dfere Str\u00e4ucher im Wachstum behindern kann ist sie nicht besonders gerne gesehen.\n\nDie Zaunwinde wurde bereits im Mittelalter aufgrund der abf\u00fchrenden Wirkung ihrer Wurzeln und Bl\u00e4tter als Heilpflanze gesch\u00e4tzt. Die mit der Zaunwinde verwandte Ackerwinde, die sich durch deutlich kleinere, rosafarben gestreifte Bl\u00fcten und einen niedrigeren Wuchs von der Zaunwinde unterscheidet, kann ebenfalls als Abf\u00fchrmittel benutzt werden. Die medizinische Wirksamkeit der kleineren Ackerwinde ist jedoch geringer als die der Zaunwinde.\n\nDie sich bis in eine H\u00f6he von 3 m windende Zaunwinde ist eine ausdauernde, kahle Pflanze mit rundlichen, stumpfkantigen St\u00e4ngeln. Die gro\u00dfen, langstieligen Bl\u00e4tter sind spitz herzf\u00f6rmig. Vom Juni bis September bildet die Zaunwinde gro\u00dfe, wei\u00dfe, einzelnstehende Bl\u00fcten aus den Achseln der Bl\u00e4tter.\nStandort / Hier findet man die Zaunwinde\n\nDiese Heilpflanze ist, mit Ausnahme der n\u00f6rdlichen Gebiete, fast \u00fcberall in Europa bis in H\u00f6henlagen von etwa 1400 m zu finden. Bevorzugte Standorte der Zaunwinde sind Wegr\u00e4nder, Z\u00e4une, Uferb\u00f6schungen und Auenlandschaften mit n\u00e4hrstoffreichen B\u00f6den.\nWirkung der Heilpflanze / Heilwirkung - Zaunwinde\n\nDie Zaunwinde wirkt abf\u00fchrend und gallenflussanregend.\nIn der Naturheilkunde verwendete Pflanzenteile\n\nIn der Naturheilkunde benutzt man von der Zaunwinde die Wurzeln und die vom Juni bis in den September gesammelten Bl\u00e4tter. Die Pflanzenteile werden kleingeschnitten und schonend im Schatten getrocknet.\nAnwendung mit der Heilkraft dieser Pflanze\n\nWichtige Inhaltsstoffe dieser Heilpflanze sind: Gerbstoffe, Harz (mit Glykosiden) und Mineralsalze\n\nDie Zaunwinde wird nur innerlich angewendet. Anwendungen mit Zaunwinde in der Naturheilkunde finden Sie unter folgenden Stichworten:\n\nLeber, Verstopfung\nBitte beachten Sie auch diesen Hinweis\n\nObwohl die Anwendungen mit Heilkr\u00e4utern oft eine positive Wirkung auf Beschwerden haben, sollte man vor der Heilpflanzenanwendung immer R\u00fccksprache mit einem Arzt halten.

Hoe het ook zij -- stoer Texaans of broeierig in Southern-style -- wat vooral belangrijk is, is dat Matt Harlan werkelijk prachtige liedjes voor het voetlicht brengt, die melodieus zijn en rijk zijn ingevuld met banjo, mandoline, pedal steel, Hammond en geweldig klinkende akoestische en elektrische gitaren.

These meteors caused injury from shattered windows, and broken glass. It is believed these meteors broke off from the larger meteor 2012-Da14, which missed the earth by less than 30,000 miles the same day. Had Da-14 stuck earth, it would have destroyed everything within a 10 mile radius much like a nuclear bomb.

The company was told not to give out any data, but they did mention component shipments for the new Iphone will begin in August. That is a further indication of an Apple iPhone 5 release date in September 2012. One of the greatest iPhone 5 features is the new display with In-Cell-panel which will be thinner and respond more accurately to touch. Apple Daily released photos from the Apple iPhone 5, which indicate an aspect ratio change for the first time since the introduction of the iPhones from 3:2 to 16:9 and four inches in size. This is an optimal size for movie http://www.youtube.com/user/FriendBlend12?feature=mheeplayback and gaming. iPhone 5 pictures show how small the new interface is, with the introduction of nine pins, signals could be better separated. Developers have found in the code of iOS 6 evidence that speaks about a dock connector with nine pins. Other rumored iPhone 5 specs include: a smooth new liquid metal body, a better battery, 4G LTE, iWallet. The http://www.tumblr.com/blog/koppster1 iPhone 5 news say: it will be 7.6 mm thick, which is significantly thinner than the previous iPhones.http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004285780711\n\n\n\nhttp://puremadonna.com/\nhttp://snooki.net/\nhttp://askpolitics.com/", "title": "\u2605\u2605\u2605Interested With Iphone?

Within 90 days of applying the solution, the results have been extremely positive - we can't quite believe it.  The curling on the fingers has lessened - from 45 degrees to only 15 degrees !!! AND the best part is, as she continues to apply the solution, her hand is getting better day by day.

Mozart \n\"Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail\" \n Welche Wonne, Welche Lust\nLucia Popp - Blonde\n Tribute for coming up Lucia Popp's birthday on 12/11.\n\n~Synopsis~\n\nACT I. Turkey, 1700s. Pasha Selim has bought three Europeans from pirates - Constanze, a Spanish woman of good family; Blonde, her English maid; and Pedrillo, servant of Constanze's fianc\u00e9, Belmonte. Belmonte has traced them to a seaside palace, where Constanze has become the pasha's favorite and Pedrillo the gardener. Blonde has been given as a gift by the pasha to his overseer, Osmin. Belmonte's first encounter is with Osmin, who acts polite until Belmonte mentions Pedrillo, the custodian's rival for Blonde. He drives Belmonte away and then rails at Pedrillo, who has come in hopes of making peace with him. Belmonte returns to find his former servant, who tells him the pasha loves Constanze but will not force himself on her. Pedrillo will try to arrange a meeting between Constanze and Belmonte and an escape by boat with Blonde, if they can get past Osmin. In hiding, Belmonte yearns for Constanze, who soon appears with Pasha Selim. When the pasha asks her why she is always depressed by his courtship of her, Constanze replies she cannot forget her love for her fianc\u00e9 from whom she was separated. After she leaves, Pedrillo introduces Belmonte to the pasha as a promising young architect. Selim welcomes him and, departing, arranges a conference for the next day. Osmin bars the way when Belmonte and Pedrillo try to enter the palace, but he is confused easily, and the two foreigners march him around in circles. Dizzy, Osmin does not notice they have gained access.\n\nACT II. In a garden, Blonde confounds Osmin with her cleverness and faces him down when he threatens her. Constanze finds Blonde and complains of her sad state, which does not improve when the pasha again asks her to marry him. She proudly refuses, preferring torture, even death. When they have gone, Blonde and Pedrillo dance into the garden, discussing their plan of escape: they will get Osmin drunk, and all four lovers will leave on Belmonte's ship. Later, Pedrillo goes about his business, finding Osmin cooperative, though drinking wine is against the Moslem religion. Thoroughly inebriated, the fat man weaves away with the bottle, leaving the coast clear for Belmonte to meet Constanze. Their reunion is shared by Blonde and Pedrillo.\n\nACT III. Just before midnight, Pedrillo places a ladder against the ladies' window and sings a serenade, the signal for escape. But he wakes Osmin, who is not too hung over to realize what is going on and takes them all to the pasha, who is angry. Belmonte suggests the pasha collect a handsome ransom from his wealthy family, the Lostados. At this, the pasha realizes that Belmonte is the son of an old enemy, the man who exiled him from his own country. But eventually he decides that rather than take blood for blood he will repay evil with good, freeing Constanze and Belmonte, even Blonde and Pedrillo. This does not sit well with Osmin, who will lose Blonde, but he is promised other rewards. The grateful lovers praise their benefactor as they prepare to set sail.", "title": "W.A.

With age, cork becomes brittle and will eventually fall off or crumble apart, but in our thirty years of cleaning mouthpieces we've found cleaning (or soaking) the mouthpiece does NOT  accelerate the process. \n\nThe tools used in this video are available here:\nSterisol Germicide Spray:\nhttp://www.hysonmusic.com/product/accessories/woodwind-accessories/sterisol-germicide-spray/\n\nHyson Music Swab:\nhttp://www.hysonmusic.com/product/band/woodwind-accessories/clarinet-accessories/maintenance-care/hyson-music-clarinet-cleaning-swab/\n\nHyson Music Mouthpiece Brush for Woodwinds:\nhttp://www.hysonmusic.com/product/band/woodwind-accessories/clarinet-accessories/yamaha-woodwind-mouthpiece-brush/\n\nAlso, a nice accessory to add to your clean mouthpiece is a mouthpiece patch, not only does it greatly improve the comfort of your teeth on the mouthpiece, but it also protects the mouthpiece from wear and tear:\n\nhttp://www.hysonmusic.com/product/band/woodwind-accessories/clarinet-accessories/yamaha-clarinet-saxophone-mouthpiece-patches/", "title": "Cleaning a Woodwind Mouthpiece (Clarinet, Bass Clarinet, Alto Saxophone, Tenor Saxophone, etc)", "publishedDate": "2011-09-10T16:39:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "4J9WTG4jrbc", "description": "Modern Music School Halkida\nGuitar --Antonis Vogiatzoglou\nBass- Giannis Papanestis \nDrums-Spiros Ligonis\nThank you for watching! \n\nConnect with us:\nOn Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/mmschalkida\nhttps://www.facebook.com/antonis.vogiatzoglou", "title": "Modern Music School Halkida live-Antonis Vogiatzoglou   (Steve Vai -- Jibboom)", "publishedDate": "2013-12-08T18:45:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "4J9x8EkFtvo", "description": "Sami Smith in the Moonlighter at Sublimity HarvestFest 2012 on Friday night", "title": "Moonlighter Sublimity Friday 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-09-16T04:10:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "4JA4OBvoEy0", "description": "Learn how to harvest Stinging Nettle (Urtica dioica) or common nettle in this video!

Sound familiar?\n\nThe Shelterbelt Theatre proudly announces the premier of The Battle of Battles, a new comedy by local, award-winning playwright Joe Basque.\n\nBased on a true Renaissance story, The Battle of Battles begins at the dawn of the Sixteenth Century. Florence has been at war for a decade. No one remembers how it started.  No one knows how it can end.  Machiavelli schemes to divert the public's attention with an artistic competition between the two greatest artists of the age\u2014Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.  All Machiavelli must do is convince Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Florence to buy in to his plan while keeping the artists from killing each other.  What could possibly go wrong? \n\nDirected by Daena Schweiger, the cast includes Noah Diaz as Salai, Mike Palmreuter as Machiavelli, Randy Vest as Leonardo da Vinci, Andy Niess as Michelangelo, Paul Schneider as Piero, Sara Planck as Tina, and You, as the Audience.  JoAnn Goodhew stage manages.  A stellar design staff includes set design by Bill Van Deest, costume design by Lindsay Pape, lighting design by Homero Vela, sound design by Daena Schweiger, properties by Britt Jorns and Rachel Salerno. Brian Callaghan mans the booth.  Projections are designed by Roxanne Wach, Kevin Barratt is the fight choreographer and the show's dramaturge is Camilla Cusani-Visconti.\n\nThe Battle of Battles runs from April 18 through May 11 at 3225 California Street, Omaha. \n\nThe curtain rises at 8 pm Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and 2 pm on Sunday.  The April 20 Easter Sunday show begins at 6 pm. A special TAG Nite Out preview on Thursday, April 17 benefits the Theatre Arts Guild scholarship fund. The theater opens thirty minutes before curtain. Make \nreservations online at shelterbelt.org or by calling (402) 341-2757. Tickets are $15 and $12 for Students, Seniors and TAG members.  All Thursday and Sunday performances are only $10.

Seit 1996 ist er mit seinen Arbeiten im internationalen Kunsthaus ARTES vertreten und erhielt Auftr\u00e4ge von Gro\u00dfunternehmen wie Airbus, Bentley, Rolls-Royce und VW f\u00fcr die er exklusive Radierungen kreierte.

He is a freelance artist since 17 years now. Before it he \nworked for several companies in Hamburg and its surroundings as \nlithographer.\nIn a very sensitive and empathic way he brings out the deep characters \nof his illustrations. Their charisma may touch the contemplators soul.\nHis style is a composition of realism and impressionism.\n\n\nThe technique\n\nLehmann sways the mature technology of etching. He cuts his mirrored \npictures into a metalsurface to create a design in intaglio just like \nthe old masters Rembrandt or D\u00fcrer did. He inks the metal plate with one \ncolor and puts it with a moistened sheet of paper in a high pressure \nprinting press. The numbers of the crafted impressions are low to keep \nup the value. Every single print will be finished in a special way and \ncolored as may be necessary. So every print is a genuine original.\n\n\nThe artists reputation\n\nConoisseurs all over europe appriciate the impressive quality of his \nfine etchings. His etchings of flowers and portraits of musicians, poets \nand other characters of the contemporary history and also views from \nvintage cars to lighthouses formed his kudos.\nHis works could be seen at the Frankfurt Book Fair, Frankfurt Ambiente, \nIAA Frankfurt Car Fair and Art Fair Europe.\nLehmann crafted etchings for clients as Caterpillar, Volkswagen, Airbus, \nBreitling, Rolls Royce and Bentley.\nA German philosopher and university prof characterized his works as \n\"truly gorgeous, technically perfect and equally absolutely romantically \nempathetic.\" \"His art concentrates the beauty of the moment\", a doctor \nof literature lauded Lehmanns etchings.", "title": "Waldhorn  Exklusiv David Moltz  Original-Radierung Bernd Lehmann", "publishedDate": "2008-12-16T22:38:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4JipHEz53sU", "description": "Minaj's new album 'Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded' is out now!

It is one of the most commonly seen wild animals of central and northern India, often seen in farmland or scrub forest. The mature male appears ox-like and is also known as the blue bull. A blue bull is called a nil gai or nilgai in India, from nil meaning blue and gai meaning a bovine animal (literally 'cow'). It is also present in parts of southern Nepal and eastern Pakistan. The species has become extinct in Bangladesh. It was known as the nilghor during the rule of Aurangzeb in the Mughal era. It is the only member of genus Boselaphus.\n\nThe Keoladeo National Park or Keoladeo Ghana National Park formerly known as the Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, India is a famous avifauna sanctuary that plays host to thousands of birds especially during the summer season. Over 230 species of birds are known to have made the National Park their home. It is also a major tourist centre with scores of ornithologists arriving here in the hibernal season. It was declared a protected sanctuary in 1971. It is also a declared World Heritage Site.\n\nKeoladeo Ghana National Park is a man-made and man-managed wetland and one of the national parks of India. The reserve protects Bharatpur from frequent floods, provides grazing grounds for village cattle and earlier was primarily used as a waterfowl hunting ground. The 29 km2 (11 sq mi) reserve is locally known as Ghana, and is a mosaic of dry grasslands, woodlands, woodland swamps, and wetlands. These diverse habitats are home to 366 bird species, 379 floral species, 50 species of fish, 13 species of snakes, 5 species of lizards, 7 amphibian species,7 turtle species, and a variety of other invertebrates. Every year thousands of migratory waterfowl visit the park for wintering breeding etc. The Sanctuary is one of the richest bird areas in the world. It is known for nesting of its resident birds and visiting migratory birds including water birds. The rare Siberian cranes used to winter in this park but this central population of Siberian Cranes is now extinct. According to Sir Peter Scott Keoladeo Sanctuary is the world's best bird area.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.
