People will be able to sympathize with the lyrics of the song as it ponders on whether the lover is doing well despite being without them, wishing they could turn back time. \nAlready in the spotlight for the O.S.T collaboration between the Groove Entertainment and Park Sun-Joo, the drama \"Fermentation Family\" is the opening drama for JTBC, depicting different human characters, which vary as much as the diverse types of kimchi, to show how they care for one another and solve conflicts through family love and friendship. \n\n\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9(FIX) _ \u30b5\u30e9\u30f3\u30a4\u30fb\u30c9\u30a5\u30ea\u30e7\u30a6\u30a9\uff08\u611b\u304c\u6016\u3044\uff09(\u767a\u52b9\u5bb6\u65cfOST Pt.3)\n\n\u5b9f\u529b\u6d3e\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7'\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\uff08FIX\uff09'\u306e\u7518\u7f8e\u306a\u30e1\u30ed\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u3002\nJTBC\u6c34\u6728\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\u767a\u9175\u5bb6\u65cf\u306eOST.Part3\u300c\u611b\u304c\u6016\u3044\u300d\u30011\u670826\u65e5\u516c\u958b\u3002\n\n\u6700\u9ad8\u306eOST\u88fd\u4f5c\u4f1a\u793e'\u30b6\u30fb\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d6\u30fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c6\u30a4\u30f3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8'\u3068\u6700\u9ad8\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u3042\u308a\u97f3\u697d\u76e3\u7763\u306e\u30d1\u30af\u30fb\u30bd\u30f3\u30b8\u30e5\u304c\u624b\u3092\u63e1\u3063\u305fJTBC\u306e\u6c34\u6728\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\"\u767a\u9175\u5bb6\u65cf\"\u306eOST.Part3\u300c\u611b\u304c\u6016\u3044\u300d\u304c1\u670826\u65e5\u306b\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\n\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\uff08FIX\uff09\u306e\u7518\u7f8e\u306a\u58f0\u3068\u9b45\u529b\u304c\u5f15\u304d\u7acb\u3064\u300c\u611b\u304c\u6016\u3044\u300d\u306f\u3001\u5225\u308c\u305f\u604b\u4eba\u3078\u306e\u601d\u3044\u304c\u65e5\u306b\u65e5\u306b\u52df\u308b\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3092\u3046\u307e\u304f\u8868\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u66f2\u3060\u3002\u5225\u308c\u305f\u604b\u4eba\u306e\u3053\u3068\u304c\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3001\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u3044\u305f\u9803\u306b\u623b\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3092\u8868\u3057\u305f\u7d14\u7c8b\u306a\u611f\u6027\u306e\u6b4c\u8a5e\u306f\u3001\u805e\u304d\u624b\u306e\u5171\u611f\u3092\u50ac\u3059\u3002\n\u30b6\u30fb\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d6\u30fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c6\u30a4\u30f3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30d1\u30af\u30fb\u30bd\u30f3\u30b8\u30e5\u3001\u5f7c\u3089\u306eOST\u30fb\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3059\u3067\u306b\u8a71\u984c\u3092\u547c\u3093\u3060\u6c34\u6728\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\"\u767a\u9175\u5bb6\u65cf\"\u306f\u3001\u97d3\u56fd\u306e\u30ad\u30e0\u30c1\u307b\u3069\u591a\u69d8\u306a\u4eba\u9593\u50cf\u3092\u793a\u3057\u3066\u5f7c\u3089\u306e\u7d46\u3084\u611b\u3001\u845b\u85e4\u3092\u63cf\u304d\u306a\u304c\u3089\u5bb6\u65cf\u611b\u3068\u53cb\u60c5\u3092\u8a9e\u308bJTBC\u306e\u958b\u5c40\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\u3060\u3002\n\n\uc2e4\ub825\ud30c \uadf8\ub8f9 '\ud53d\uc2a4(FIX)'\uc758 \uac10\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc120\uc728\nJTBC \uc218\ubaa9 \ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8 \ubc1c\ud6a8\uac00\uc871 O.S.T Part.3, '\uc0ac\ub791\uc774 \ub450\ub824\uc6cc' 1\uc6d4 26\uc77c \uacf5\uac1c\n\n\ucd5c\uace0\uc758 O.S.T \uc81c\uc791\uc0ac'\ub354\uadf8\ub8e8\ube0c\uc5d4\ud130\ud14c\uc778\uba3c\ud2b8'\uc640 \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc544\ud2f0\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc774\uc790 \uc74c\uc545\uac10\ub3c5\uc778 \ubc15\uc120\uc8fc\uac00 \ubb49\uce5c JTBC \uc218\ubaa9 \ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8 '\ubc1c\ud6a8\uac00\uc871' OST.

That's the program that provides eligible Sandy homeowners with 10,000 dollar grants to incentivize them to stay in their homes. Nearly all that money has now been distributed. We've sent checks now to 18,200 people of the 18,500 people who applied. And so, nearly all that money has now been distributed and everybody who has applied has gotten that check, short of 300 families left. Ninety eight percent of that has been processed, mailed out, and in the hands of people and we're happy that we've been able to do that. 1,339 Brick residents have received those grants totaling over 13 million dollars, 73 homeowners here in Brick have signed the RREM Program grant awards totaling nearly 7.5 million dollars here in Brick. Brick residents have received nearly 27 million dollars in FEMA individual assistance and Brick also received a 5 million dollar loan from FEMA under the Community Disaster Recovery Loan Program to help them with the individual expenses in town.

There he photographs an eclectic band of \"catadores\" \u2014 or self-designated pickers of recyclable materials. Muniz's initial objective was to \"paint\" the catadores with garbage. However, his collaboration with these inspiring characters as they recreate photographic images of themselves out of garbage reveals both the dignity and despair of the catadores as they begin to re-imagine their lives.

It is one of two species in the genus Azadirachta, and is native to India and the Indian subcontinent including Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Typically growing in tropical and semi-tropical regions. Neem trees now also grow in islands in the southern part of Iran. Its fruits and seeds are the source of neem oil.\n\nNeem is a fast-growing tree that can reach a height of 15--20 metres (49--66 ft), rarely to 35--40 metres (115--131 ft). It is evergreen, but in severe drought it may shed most or nearly all of its leaves. The branches are wide and spreading. The fairly dense crown is roundish and may reach a diameter of 15--20 metres (49--66 ft) in old, free-standing specimens. The neem tree is very similar in appearance to its relative, the Chinaberry (Melia azedarach).\n\nThe opposite, pinnate leaves are 20--40 centimetres (7.9--15.7 in) long, with 20 to 31 medium to dark green leaflets about 3--8 centimetres (1.2--3.1 in) long. The terminal leaflet is often missing. The petioles are short.\n\nThe (white and fragrant) flowers are arranged in more-or-less drooping axillary panicles which are up to 25 centimetres (9.8 in) long. The inflorescences, which branch up to the third degree, bear from 150 to 250 flowers. An individual flower is 5--6 millimetres (0.20--0.24 in) long and 8--11 millimetres (0.31--0.43 in) wide. Protandrous, bisexual flowers and male flowers exist on the same individual tree.\n\nThe fruit is a smooth (glabrous) olive-like drupe which varies in shape from elongate oval to nearly roundish, and when ripe is 1.4--2.8 centimetres (0.55--1.10 in) by 1.0--1.5 centimetres (0.39--0.59 in). The fruit skin (exocarp) is thin and the bitter-sweet pulp (mesocarp) is yellowish-white and very fibrous. The mesocarp is 0.3--0.5 centimetres (0.12--0.20 in) thick. The white, hard inner shell (endocarp) of the fruit encloses one, rarely two or three, elongated seeds (kernels) having a brown seed coat.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Adventitious roots, contractile roots, structural roots \u2212 you name a type of root and we've got something to say about it.\nThat's because roots are the most common cause of pipe blockages; something else we know a fair bit about. The potential of tree roots to inhibit flow within your pipes, create blockages and damage can't be underestimated.\nRoots do have a vital role to play in your garden, of course. Without roots, there would be no foliage as roots provide your plants with a secure supply of nutrients and water as well as anchorage and support.\nWe thought you might be interested in knowing a little bit more about these amazingly clever, yet potentially destructive, organisms.\nRoot architecture\nThe pattern of development of a root system is termed root architecture. The architecture of a root system can be considered in a similar way to above-ground architecture of a plant in terms of the size, branching and distribution of the component parts.\nThere are two types of roots which are commonly found in suburban gardens around Melbourne: fine roots and coarse roots.\nFine root are primary roots (usually less than 2 mm diameter) that have the function of water and nutrient uptake. They are often heavily branched and support fungi. These roots may be short lived, but are replaced by the plant in an ongoing process of root 'turnover'.\nCoarse roots are roots that have undergone secondary thickening and have a woody structure. These roots have some ability to absorb water and nutrients, but their main function is transport and to provide a structure to connect the smaller diameter, fine roots to the rest of the plant.\nHaving a balanced architecture allows fine roots to exploit soil efficiently around a plant and the plastic nature of root growth allows the plant to then concentrate its resources where nutrients and water are more easily available. A balanced coarse root architecture, with roots distributed relatively evenly around the stem base, is necessary to provide support to larger plants and trees.\nTree roots normally grow outward to about three times the branch spread. Roots on one side of a tree normally supply the foliage on that same side of the tree. Thus when roots on one side of a tree are injured, the branches and leaves on that same side of the tree may die or wilt.\nRoot depths\nThe distribution of vascular plant roots within soil depends on plant form, the spatial and temporal availability of water and nutrients, and the physical properties of the soil. The deepest roots are generally found in deserts and temperate coniferous forests; the shallowest in tundra, boreal forest and temperate grasslands.\nSome roots can grow as deep as the tree is high but the majority of roots from most plants are found relatively close to the surface where nutrient availability and aeration are more favourable for growth. Rooting depth may be physically restricted by rock or compacted soil close below the surface, or by sewer pipes.vaporooter is the solution to controlling tree roots\nhttp://www.longbeach.net.au", "title": "Vaporooter will control trees like this", "publishedDate": "2011-06-17T20:44:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9LGfmziTVoY", "description": "Foxtail Fern Asparagus densiflorus Meyeri HD 01 by Laborator TEBA\nOferta Speciala - plante si seminte de vanzare     http://www.albizia.ro/\n+40 74 782 1314    /    074 782 1314     Arbori, Plante si Flori cu pret redus.\nAsparagus densiflorus Meyeri\nScientific classification\nClade:  Angiosperms\nClade:  Monocots\nOrder:  Asparagales\nFamily:  Asparagaceae\nSubfamily: Asparagoideae\nGenus:  Asparagus\nSpecies:  A. densiflorus\nBinomial name: Asparagus densiflorus\nAsparagus fern Species:\nAsparagus aethiopicus\nAsparagus densiflorus\nAsparagus plumosus\nAsparagus setaceus\nAsparagus virgatus\nAceste imagini au fost luate cu Samsung Galaxy - Smartphone - HD 1920 X 1080\nDaca dori\u021bi se vede\u021bi si alte video cu plante si flori ave\u021bi link-uri mai jos:\nBuganvillia Rosie - Red 06\nhttp://youtu.be/ETgq4VRwfNE\nBuganvillia Magenta Rosie - Red 05\nhttp://youtu.be/nF9h1j21co0\nBuganvillia White Flowers - Spotted Leaves 04\nhttp://youtu.be/IAFTrj-A8uA\nBuganvillia planta flori albe - white 03\nhttp://youtu.be/j8Gey3q1Wd0\nBuganvillia planta flori galbene - yellow 02\nhttp://youtu.be/XO6vReKa8Yw\nBuganvillia planta flori magenta - purple 01\nhttp://youtu.be/ysNDpRAGtuY\nLiliac Indian sau Crape Myrtle, Boboci noi cu flori si pastai vechi 01 \nhttp://youtu.be/7m_KCDbNS-w\nLiliac Indian sau Crape Myrtle, Boboci noi cu flori si pastai vechi 02\nhttp://youtu.be/mdYTFJyZxHU\nLiliac Indian sau Crape Myrtle, boboci noi cu flori si pastai vechi 03\nhttp://youtu.be/lTc47e0yJ0Y\nLiliac Indian sau Crape Myrtle, Boboci noi cu flori albe 01\nhttp://youtu.be/NBra6ybPOVM\nLiliac Indian sau Crape Myrtle, Boboci noi cu flori albe 02\nhttp://youtu.be/VGXnFjfZHNU\nLiliac Indian sau Crape Myrtle, Boboci noi cu flori albe 03\nhttp://youtu.be/EpLBvFioJCs\nLiliac Indian sau Crape Myrtle, Boboci noi cu Flori roz 01\nhttp://youtu.be/CwdH9b-CZpI\nLiliac Indian sau Crape Myrtle, Boboci noi cu Flori Roz 02\nhttp://youtu.be/fuwJAd6ldys\nLiliac Indian - Lagerstroemia Indica Flori Roz 03\nhttp://youtu.be/IQr8jxrX3Yg\nLiliac Indian - Lagerstroemia Indica Flori Roz 04\nhttp://youtu.be/fwRD12uS8jQ\nRobinia hispida salc\u00e2m rosu             http://youtu.be/xUZgRrHnUrY\nPaulownia tomentosa kiri dragon paulovnia empress   http://youtu.be/zQhxeJleSxY\nAlbizia julibrissin        http://youtu.be/lsSIRjCWkRY\nSpiraea Japonica       http://youtu.be/ZL-gagxmkbM\nCordyline Australis Purpurea 01   http://youtu.be/L6wvtpb_5yU\nCordyline Australis Purpurea 02   http://youtu.be/3EQbCyDzecM\nCordyline Australis Purpurea 03   http://youtu.be/kldr_C7xXms\nPentru alte plante, flori si copaci decorative vizita\u021bi:\nYOU TUBE Channel: LaboratorTEBA\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/laboratorteba", "title": "Foxtail Fern Asparagus densiflorus Meyeri HD 01", "publishedDate": "2013-12-01T05:03:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "9LGhHrxTbCw", "description": "Thom Hartmann's crazy alert", "title": "Crazy Alert!

Think of a Mexican wave in a football crowd: the wave moves around the stadium, while each spectator stays in their seat only moving up then down when it's their turn.\n\nThere are two types of waves, transverse and longitudinal. In transverse waves, the oscillations are at right angles to the direction of the energy transfer. Light and other types of electromagnetic radiation are transverse waves.\n\nIn longitudinal waves, the oscillations are parallel to the direction of the energy transfer. Sound waves are longitudinal waves. These waves show areas of compression and rarefaction, the areas of compression are where the parts of the wave are close together, while the areas of rarefaction are where they are far apart.\n \nWaves have an amplitude, a wavelength and a frequency. The amplitude of a wave is its maximum disturbance from its undisturbed position. Which basically means the distance between the middle and it's highest point. The wavelength of a wave is the distance between a point on one wave and the same point on the next wave.  And the frequency is the number of waves that pass a certain point each second. The unit of frequency is measured in hertz, but it's also measured in kilohertz, megahertz and gigahertz for very high frequencies.\n\nThe speed of a wave is related to its frequency and wavelength, according to this equation: v=f x (lambda) where v is the wave speed in metres per second, f is the frequency in hertz and (lambda) is the wavelength in metres. For example, a wave with a frequency of 100 Hz and a wavelength of 2 m travels at 200 m/s. But that's nothing compared to light's 299 792 458 m/s. That's pretty damn fast.", "title": "Transverse and Longitudinal Waves", "publishedDate": "2013-11-17T19:33:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "9LkX-CjH-ow", "description": "Uighur protesters briefly scuffled with police during a protest near the Chinese consulate in the Turkish city of Istanbul.

Those innocents know they are in the majority, but they do not know who is Traitor and who is not.\n\nThe Traitors must use the element of surprise and their special equipment, if they are to succeed. The Innocent just have to survive, which means finding out who the Traitors are and killing them before they kill you. Of course everyone is holding a big gun, and everyone looks suspicious...\n\nFor the Innocent, knowledge is power: who is acting strangely? Who can be linked to evidence found on corpses? Who is still alive, even?\"\n\nCheck out our free game! \u25bc \n\nApple iOS http://t.co/1SXu4VU8HM\nGooglePlay: http://bit.ly/IwMMWA \nAmazon: http://amzn.to/1jSWZsz\n\nWant some gear? \nUS Store: http://seananners.spreadshirt.com\nEU Store: http://seananners.spreadshirt.net\nUK Store: http://seananners-uk.spreadshirt.co.uk\n\nMinx: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheRPGMinx\nAaron: https://www.youtube.com/user/ItsUncleSlam\nDelirious: https://www.youtube.com/user/H2ODelirious\nChilled: https://www.youtube.com/user/CriousGamers\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/SeaNanners\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/SeaNannersPage\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seananno", "title": "#1 NEWS TEAM (Garry's Mod Trouble in Terrorist Town)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-13T16:00:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "9LmENZ38Vk0", "description": "Cubbykraft Australia is the most popular place for kids Cubby House Kits all pre-cut and ready to assemble this video by cubbykraft shows how to install the roof of a cubbyhouse", "title": "How to build a Cubby House roof part 1", "publishedDate": "2012-07-20T06:45:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Lmsp1PQ5UA", "description": "for more crafts goto: http://www.myfroggystuff.blogspot.com", "title": "How to make a dollhouse lamp", "publishedDate": "2011-07-14T12:56:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "9LmyWN6fjqs", "description": "Link Del CD: http://www.4shared.com/rar/Dlervq_q/AFG.html\n\u266b Lilly Goodman \u266b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk8wab6ioIo\nLilly Goodman Nadie Me Dijo Con Letra https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgw8b-ZwuBA\nLilly Goodman El Dios Que Me Ve \u266b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaceWyxYfqs\nLilly Goodman Mi Necesidad \u266b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdhrXsbeZSM\nLilly Goodman Nadie Me Dijo \u266b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r69beGVX4A\nLilly Goodman Nadie Me Dijo \u266b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r69beGVX4A\nLilly Goodman Ve Por Tu Sue\u00f1o \u266b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDZpwIYFDZs\nLilly Goodman Me Amas \u266b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKLgmuVmJPs\nLilly Goodman De Aqu\u00ed a 20 A\u00f1os \u266b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LmyWN6fjqs\nLilly Goodman Tu Presencia \u266b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo77q4YxI3o\nLilly Goodman Solo Quedas Tu \u266b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3wkIwdEyxw\nLilly Goodman Vive Rie Vuela \u266b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCEgJJRB8Vw\nLilly Goodman Take Care of Me \u266b https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz05KVtHYDU\nLilly Goodman Nadie Me Dijo Con Letra https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgw8b-ZwuBA\nLilly goodman lo mas nuevo \u266b Musica Cristiana \u266b\n01.

Visit to read the complete transcript, watch additional reports on this topic, and more information on award-winning journalist Amy Goodman.\n\nStudents at Wesleyan University in Connecticut are continuing to protest against the school's decision to change its admission practices by ending what is known as \"need-blind admissions\" to all applicants. Qualified students now face possible rejection if they are deemed unable to pay full tuition, now around $60,000 a year, making it one of the most expensive schools in the country. Students say the new policy will target the poor and middle class.\n\nDaniel Plafker, Wesleyan Student Activist: \"The reason we're out here today is to stand in opposition to proposed cuts to the need-blind financial aid policy. Essentially what that allows the admissions office here to do, and in other places, is to actively discriminate against applicants, based on their socio-economic class. This is a decision that was made behind the backs of students, without transparency, behind closed doors, at a time when most of the students weren't even on campus to know about it.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Democracy Now! video production fellow Nemo Allen attempted to interview Wesleyan President Michael Roth about the policy change after the school's football game. Roth refused to answer questions and then grabbed Allen's microphone and walked away with it.\n\nNemo Allen: \"Why has there been a total lack of transparency with this decision being made? President Michael Roth of Wesleyan University, why has there been a total lack of transparency?\"\n\nMichael Roth: \"There has been a lot of transparency. There has been a lot of transparency.\"\n\nNemo Allen: \"There has been? Excuse me, Roth, you have to give that back.\"\n\nMichael Roth: \"Who are you? I don't have to do anything.\"\n\nNemo Allen: \"I'm with Democracy Now! You have to give it back.\"\n\nMichael Roth: \"Thank you. I will. We're going to walk over to Media Relations.\"\nWesleyan President Michael Roth eventually returned the microphone after being instructed to do so by a police officer.\n\nTune in to Democracy Now! for our upcoming Election Night broadcast on November 6: http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2012/10/10/expanding_the_debate_upcoming_democracy_now_election_specials\n\nTo watch the entire weekday independent news hour, read the transcript, download the podcast, search our vast archive, or to find more information about Democracy Now! and Amy Goodman, visit http://www.democracynow.org.\n\nFOLLOW DEMOCRACY NOW!

DLT was cleared of 12 charges last month, but faces a retrial on two other charges. The Harris trial has not yet begun.\n\nClifford is best-known in Britain for selling so-called \"kiss-and-tell\" stories about the rich and famous to scandal-hungry tabloid newspapers.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntd.tv\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "Celebrity Publicist, Max Clifford, Due to Stand Trial on Sex Charges", "publishedDate": "2014-03-04T14:41:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Mg-wO8W_zQ", "description": "KIYUNA RYO Male Kata Finale - 2014 World Karate Championships\nSubscribe to the WKF YouTube channel and don't miss the action \u2192 http://bit.ly/N7c4H0", "title": "KIYUNA RYO Male Kata Finale - 2014 World Karate Championships", "publishedDate": "2014-11-09T17:21:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Mg1_-fzNas", "description": "SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 - I9300 - CAPTAIN AMERICA BATTERY DOOR CASE INSTALLATION TUTORIAL", "title": "X case - S3 - I9300 - CAPTAIN AMERICA - AVENGERS - BATTERY DOOR CASE - INSTALLATION TUTS", "publishedDate": "2013-06-17T12:42:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "9MgF8Py9KNg", "description": "Heal yourself , find esteem, calm, and retain your life focus with these supportive audios.

Males are usually larger than females and have longer tails. Males play a part in rearing the young. Pheasants typically eat seeds and some insects.\n\nThe best-known is the Common Pheasant, which is widespread throughout the world in introduced feral populations and in farm operations.

Nevada currently mines 79% of all the gold in the United States, which is equivalent to 5,640,000 troy ounces (175 t) in 2009. Total gold production from Nevada recorded from 1835 to 2008 totals 152,000,000 troy ounces (4,700 t), worth over US $228 billion at 2011 prices. Almost all the gold in Nevada comes from large open pit mining and cyanide heap leaching recovery...\n\nUnlike coal and oil extraction, where mining companies pay royalties for minerals obtained from public lands, gold mining companies do not pay any royalties for deposits claimed on federal public lands. This is because gold mines on public land operate under the General Mining Act of 1872.\n\nAlthough Nevada was known much more for silver in the 19th century, many of the early silver-mining districts also produced considerable quantities of gold. The Comstock Lode, for instance, produced 8,600,000 troy ounces (270 t) of gold through 1959, and the Eureka district produced 1,200,000 troy ounces (37 t). And the Robinson copper mine has produced well over 2,700,000 troy ounces (84 t) gold, along with over 4 billion pounds (1,500,000 tonnes) of copper...\n\nCarlin Trend\n\nGold was discovered in the vicinity of Carlin in Eureka County in the 1870s, but production was small. Placer deposits were discovered in 1907, but the deposits were too small to cause much excitement. It was not until 1961 that the Newmont Mining Corporation found the large low-grade gold deposit at Carlin that the mining industry began to take notice. The Carlin mine began producing gold in 1965... It was not until the gold price shot up in the late 1970s that mining companies rushed to look for similar deposits.\n\nThe Carlin Trend, part of what is also known as the Carlin Unconformity by geologists, is 5 miles (8 km) wide and 40 miles (60 km) long running northwest-southeast, has since produced more gold than any other mining district in the United States. The trend surpassed 50,000,000 troy ounces (1,600 t) of gold in 2002...\n\nGolden Fleece Mine (Nevada)\n\nThe Golden Fleece Mine, Washoe County, Nevada, near Poeville site, was operated by the Golden Fleece Gold & Silver Mining Company, incorporated on February 2, 1875, which held one patented claim on the site. W. F. Stewart had published a geological report on the mine in 1879, which had an eight-foot vein of ore. The small mining site was located at latitude: 39.584753, longitude: -119.903055 and has received more interest from historical point of view, than for its yield of gold. Several other mines were operating in the Poeville Mining District during 1863 and mid 1880.\n\nGoldfield\n\nGoldfield was discovered in 1900, and began major gold production in 1902. The ore occurs in altered shear zones in Tertiary dacite and andesite. Total gold production through 1959 was 4,200,000 troy ounces (130 t).\n\nRobinson/Ely\n\nThe Robinson district at Ely, Nevada produced about 3,000,000 troy ounces (93 t) of gold through 1990...\n\nhttp://nvghosttowns.topcities.com/pastpro/gilbert.htm\n\nThe Hardscrabble district was first mined in the 1870s but it was short-lived and little was produced. During the 1880s, a small camp called Garfield, named after the recently assassinated President James Garfield, formed five miles south of the future location of Gilbert. The camp was located next to the Alto Divide mine at Cook Spring. A small mill operated there for many years. The first serious mining in the northern part of the district began in June 1896 when Herman Gilbert and Homer Thompson, searching for a rich lode Charles Lampson had found earlier but then lost the location of, located a new lode they named the Carrie mine. The partners moved a house from Candelaria to the mine. The mine proved most promising but in May 1900, the boom began at Tonopah and the two men headed there to seek their fortune leasing mines. Sadly, both died in 1905 before having the chance to return to work the Carrie mine.\n\nGilbert's sons, Fred and Logan, returned in 1916 and leased the Carrie mine from the company formed to manage their father's and Thompson's estate. But in 1918, the brothers sold the mine and went to the booming Divide district, just south of Tonopah. Charles Lampson returned to the area in 1922 and after a couple of years, found an old marker he had placed on his discovery in the 1890s. He proclaimed the mine the Last Hope and showed the Gilbert brothers its location. The mine was officially located on September 10, 1924 but the public didn't find out about the new strike until October 30...", "title": "Gold in Nevada: New Strike at Last Hope Mine 1927 Kinograms Newsreel", "publishedDate": "2013-05-05T17:30:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "9MqzKihSrFI", "description": "", "title": "Seamless extrusion of Aluminium Tubes (direct)", "publishedDate": "2012-10-04T09:22:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "9MrMpIxApUA", "description": "S\u00edguenos en Twitter: \n@DanteACMusic \n@RachelDdRG\n\nEsperamos que os guste mucho. \n\u00a1\u00a1LIKE Y SUSCRIBIROS!! \n\nGrabado en Sonido Cr\u00f3nico.", "title": "Dante - Todo lo que pidas (Con Reichel)", "publishedDate": "2014-03-14T14:43:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "9MsVGqgpjSc", "description": "The 420 kilometer diameter Odysseus impact basin dominates Saturn's icy moon Tethys.

Se encuentran dentro del cerebro y producen las conexiones entre las diferentes zonas de este \u00f3rgano.\nLas c\u00e9lulas nerviosas se producen en la etapa de gestaci\u00f3n, y no se reproducen.\nCada neurona posee un cuerpo neuronal o soma, que consiste de un n\u00facleo rodeado de una peque\u00f1a cantidad de citoplasma. El cuerpo de la neurona es siempre irregular y puede adoptar distintas formas; sus n\u00facleos son esf\u00e9ricos y de gran tama\u00f1o. Sus citoplasmas poseen fibrillas y presentan unos corp\u00fasculos llamados de Nissl que representan un papel fundamental en el impulso nervioso. Del soma neuronal, surgen prolongaciones citoplasm\u00e1ticas que pueden ser de dos tipos:\nLas dendritas: Que son m\u00faltiples filamentos, cortos y ramificados en sus extremos. Hacen contacto con otras c\u00e9lulas nerviosas. Su funci\u00f3n es la recolecci\u00f3n de los est\u00edmulos que llegan a la neurona y tambi\u00e9n del transporte de los nutrientes necesarios al interior de la c\u00e9lula nerviosa.\n\nEl ax\u00f3n: Es un largo filamento cil\u00edndrico de citoplasma que sale del cuerpo de la neurona. Esta rodeado de una prolongaci\u00f3n de la membrana de la neurona. En su interior presenta mitocondrias y neurofilamentos. Cada neurona tiene solo un ax\u00f3n aunque en ocasiones este puede presentarse ramificado. Muchos de los axones de las c\u00e9lulas nerviosas se hallan recubiertos por una vaina de l\u00edpidos denominada mielina. Esta vaina acelera la velocidad de transmisi\u00f3n de los impulsos nerviosos, los axones provistos de mielina transportan el impulso nervioso con una velocidad 20 veces mayor que los axones amiel\u00ednicos.\n \nLa mielina es una cubierta constituida por materia grasa y esto se debe a que esta forma esta constituida por giros conc\u00e9ntricos de la membrana celular y que la misma a su vez esta compuesta por dos estratos muy finos de prote\u00ednas y un estrato de grasa interpuesto entre ellos.\n\nLos axones se re\u00fanen en grupo y forman los nervios. Los nervios son visibles, y consisten en cientos de axones. Contienen una mezcla de fibras sensitivas y motoras. Los nervios pueden, por lo tanto, conducir los diferentes tipos de impulso. Estos impulsos viajan en sentido opuestos seg\u00fan sean sensitivos o motores. Los axones de las neuronas pueden miden hasta un metro de largo. Los nervios, o fibras nerviosas son estructuras que llevan a al periferia los impulsos motores para los m\u00fasculos o secretores para las gl\u00e1ndulas, tambi\u00e9n conducen los impulsos sensitivos recogidos en la periferia.\nEntre las neuronas existe una masa celular de origen ectod\u00e9rmico llamada Neuroglia que ocupa los espacios intercelulares que quedan libres; su funci\u00f3n es de sost\u00e9n y nutrici\u00f3n. El tejido nervioso esta compuesto por el conjunto formado por las neuronas y la neuroglia.", "title": "La neurona", "publishedDate": "2012-08-23T04:34:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "9N-ncnHRms0", "description": "22 Miranda Street, Blockhouse Bay\nWestern Realty Ltd Licensed (REAA 2008)\nMahalia Levi\nRay White Glen Eden\n\nThis 1950&#39;s weatherboard home is no stranger to the warmth of the sun.

Over the last three years we have lost just three games while winning three league and two CIF championships. My first two years I earned MVP honors playing quarterback. As a sophomore I had a career high game of 360 all-purpose yards in one game before being called up to varsity to start at receiver and tight end. While I am big, strong and tough, I personally believe my best assets are my versatility, tenaciousness and relentless determination. As you will see in my videos, I have superb hands and am rarely brought down by the first tackler. I take as much pride in making a good block or tackle as I do in making an excellent catch. I am a team leader, always giving 110% and sacrificing for the benefit of the team. Lastly, the effort I put forth on the field is matched by the work I perform in the classroom. My goal is to fulfill my potential as a scholar-athlete in the classroom and contribute in any way I can to my team's success on the field.\n\nEmail: CodyTuttle@Hotmail.com\n\nMore Video At: www.youtube.com/user/warriorct8", "title": "CODY TUTTLE (WR/TE/ATH) - UCLA June 20, 2010", "publishedDate": "2010-06-27T22:15:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9N3T2WsXnJ8", "description": "Price: $79.00\nMake a sweet splash with these saucy summer sandals!\nThong-style construction with adjustable buckle closure.\nLaser-cut leather upper.\nMan-made lining.\nLightly cushioned man-made footbed.\nFlexible man-made sole.\nImported.\nMeasurements:\nHeel Height: 1/2 in\nWeight: 7 oz\n\n\nnine west strut stuff womens black leather\nnine west until then womens red leather\nnine west flats\nnine west kenie", "title": "Nine West Polygala", "publishedDate": "2014-07-09T06:47:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9N3mYum_OMw", "description": "", "title": "How To Play Wheels Of Steel By Saxon On Guitar", "publishedDate": "2012-08-27T21:35:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9N4FH4jYwBA", "description": "Rising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Indah Nevertari - Buttons - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Indah Nevertari - Buttons - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11\n\nOpening Rising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Rising Star Winning 11: http://youtu.be/MSsXajBRk-0\n\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Hanin Dhiya - Hurt - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11: http://youtu.be/WhRS2XzgBPA\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Hanin Dhiya - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/bxjmhxKrimM\n\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Sonny Saragih - Love Of My Life - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11: \nhttp://youtu.be/UNqdOwUFHxI\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Sonny Saragih - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/5Gi-jBc0PNY\n\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Evony Arty - I Try - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11: http://youtu.be/dOyyYG7itOA\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Evony Arty - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/pE267F361Mg\n\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - BluesMates - Sesuatu - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11: http://youtu.be/z6ciuO4o-0s\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Syahrini Peluk Dang Cium Vokalis BluesMates: http://youtu.be/l07dXLvdM40\n\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - CND - Let Her Go - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11: http://youtu.be/Q38q6NTCBuI\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk CND - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/M_waMPuEu-0\n\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Ghaitsa Kenang - Muda (Le O Le O) - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11: http://youtu.be/6knNqn06AC0\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Ghaitsa Kenang - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/gmMwAvvKK54\n\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Indah Nevertari - Buttons - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11: http://youtu.be/9N4FH4jYwBA\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Indah Nevertari - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/Eg4PN9srCVw\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Ahmad Dhani Feat Syahrini & Indah Nevertari - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11: \nhttp://youtu.be/KJEBDr2K6lk\n\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Talita Arsyta - Impossible - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11: http://youtu.be/FyaYszwHrVA\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Talita Arsyta - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/k8X4R5sxGB0\n\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - ERKA - Mencintaimu - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11: http://youtu.be/J2yMtI98tY8\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk ERKA - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/bvadm-K-rpY\n\n Rising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Reyna Qotrunnada - Rahasia Hati - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11:\nhttp://youtu.be/jypkua9QNK8\n\nRising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Mega Mauro - Con Te Partiro - Rising Star Indonesia Winning 11: \nhttp://youtu.be/2ufQtggEkqU", "title": "Rising Star Indonesia 31 Oktober 2014 - Indah Nevertari - Buttons - Rising Star Indonesia", "publishedDate": "2014-10-31T17:20:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "9N4e0_l3CUo", "description": "Watch our video on seaweed wild food foraging, an increasingly popular thing to do from our coastal cottages in Pembrokeshire.

The La Ferrassie Neanderthal man was short but stocky. If a modern man came nose-to-nose with a Neanderthal, could he take him in a fight?\n \nPossibly. A Neanderthal would have a clear power advantage over his Homo sapiens opponent. Many of the Neanderthals archaeologists have recovered had Popeye forearms, possibly the result of a life spent stabbing wooly mammoths and dismantling their carcasses. Neanderthal also had a wider pelvis and lower center of gravity, which would have made him a powerful grappler. \n\nThat doesn't mean that we would be an easy kill for our extinct relative. Homo sapiens probably has a longer reach and more stamina. And we could deploy these advantages to maximum effect using our superior wits.  Neanderthals on average were about 4 inches shorter than modern American men. So, a guy of above-average build would have an excellent chance of defeating a Neanderthal in hand-to-hand combat if he could keep his opponent at arm's length, survive the initial onslaught and wear him down.\n\nOf course, Neanderthals are lightweights compared to some of our other evolutionary neighbors. You would not want to encounter Homo heidelbergensis on a deserted sidewalk. Some specimens were more than seven feet tall, and they were cannibalistic at times, which means they knew how to fight other archaic humans. Paranthropus boisei would also have been a terror in combat.  That creature had powerful jaws, enormous teeth, very well-developed back muscles and is often described as a gorilla head on a human body.", "title": "Neanderthal vs Homo Sapiens:  Who Would Win in a Fight?", "publishedDate": "2012-10-26T00:08:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "9NPaFJDo9fc", "description": "Robins go in and out of their nest in the pampas grass", "title": "Robins nest", "publishedDate": "2013-07-07T20:27:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9NPdKUPJmTg", "description": "Secret Service Director Julia Pierson addresses the House Oversight Committee about a recent White House intrusion.", "title": "Director: White House intrusion was 'unacceptable'", "publishedDate": "2014-09-30T15:51:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9NPno0EBVS8", "description": "In this exclusive interview, Anna Wintour, Editor of Vogue, speaks to Telegraph Fashion Director Hilary Alexander about the support New York Fashion Week gives to exciting new designers, giving London Fashion Week a run for its money.\nVideo Director: Pete Fergusson", "title": "Anna Wintour talks to The Telegraph at New York Fashion Week", "publishedDate": "2010-09-14T05:10:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "9NQkyQ7iuSE", "description": "VOTE FOR ME HERE:: \nhttp://bsta.rs/9be32\n\nLike x Comment x Rate X SHARE\nCONNECT WITH ME \n iLL Conscience  [Email]-- iLLConscience@gmail.com \nYouTube : YungMuzikProducer\nFacebook.com/illconscienceofficial\nTwitter - Ill_Conscience", "title": "iLL Conscience - \"Underdog\" Don't Fu[n]k Up Our Beats 6 *DFUOB6*", "publishedDate": "2014-03-10T06:20:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "9NR1MTmc-hw", "description": "This video discusses the difference between a townhome & a condominium.", "title": "\"The Difference Between a Townhome & a Condominium\" HAR's Consumer Knowledge Series", "publishedDate": "2009-10-13T15:39:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "9NR38EMIzM4", "description": "www.neovn.com", "title": "ANTRACOL", "publishedDate": "2011-05-24T07:45:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "9NR6qfdQP9E", "description": "HERES THE UPDATED VERSION http://youtu.be/aDCJnCtuAXM !!!!

When the body ages there is a reduction in its ability to convert B12 which leads to a deficiency in the body. Elderly and vegetarians are especially susceptible to being deficient in b12.\n\nVitamin B12 is extremely important in the body for:.\n- Enhancing mood and healthy energy levels.\n- Promoting red blood cell production.\n- Supporting healthy nerve tissue and brain cells.\n- Supporting conversion of homocysteine to the vital amino acid methionine.\n\nWhy is Methyl B-12 Different?\nMethlycobalamin(Methyl B12) is more bioactive than other forms of B12(cyanocobalamin) which triggers Methyl B12 to be much better absorbed and retained by the body.\n\nWhy Choose Apex Natural \u2122 Methyl B-12 Solution?\n1.

GQM22 product line includes the world's top multilayer ceramic capacitors equipped with electrodes made of base metals. These capacitors are designed for the rated voltage of 500 Volts. GQM22 capacitors offer a high quality, small capacity allowance and perfect high-frequency performance.      Though it is well known that base metal electrodes allow reducing losses and improve performance, such electrodes did not enjoy wide use until recently as they have restrictive parameter adjustment requirements and firing conditions.     Murata employed its own material engineering achievements and an innovative ceramic co-firing technology in GQM22 capacitors which allowed using base metal electrodes.     GQM22 capacitors are a perfect choice for matching and connecting circuits used in power amplifiers of mobile communication equipment, WiMax and LTE base stations and other similar radio-frequency devices.     Together with other available Murata's capacitors designed for the rated voltage of 100 and 250 volts, GQM22 line will offer you high performance and low equivalent series resistance within VHF, UHF and gigahertz ranges. These innovative capacitors provide 40% performance improvement at 1 megahertz as compared to Murata's general-purpose capacitors intended for medium and high frequencies.     GQM22 dimensions are as follows: 2.8 mm per 2.8 mm per 1.15 mm with the capacity varying from 0.5 to 100 picofarad. That's why you can easily use such capacitors in the equipment requiring small allowance i.e. the capacity allowance is \u00b10,1 picofarad.

In der Anatomie wird zwischen echten, das hei\u00dft mit einem fl\u00fcssigkeitsgef\u00fcllten Spalt versehenen, und unechten Gelenken unterschieden. Mit einem Pseudogelenk ist dagegen der beweglich gebliebene Knochenbereich nach einem nicht verheilten Knochenbruch gemeint.\n\nVorg\u00e4nge und Erscheinungen im Inneren eines Gelenkes werden als intraartikul\u00e4r bezeichnet (z.

Eine Gelenkspiegelung wird Arthroskopie genannt.\n\nAuszug aus Wikipedia: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelenk\n\nWollen Sie Ihre Schmerzen sofort lindern?

This may seem an odd statement to make about something which is so bloody funny. But so it seems to me. Gogol, with his play, has been making people laugh for over 150 years, but we laugh because we recognize ourselves, we recognize the pomposity and venality of human beings when they find themselves, or put themselves, in positions of power, petty or otherwise. Gogol has crafted a wonderful comic situation, where he is able to expose the pathetic desires and appetites of a small town ruling clique, but he does so in order to highlight the social injustice that lies beneath the surface. As Gogol himself says in \"An Author's Confession\" (1847):\nI decided to gather in one pile all the bad in Russia of which I was then aware, all the injustices which are committed in those places, and on those occasions where justice above all is demanded of man, and at the same time, to laugh at everything.\nThe English version by Adrian Mitchell leaps off the page, written as it is by a poet and playwright with a great love and gift for language, and is all the more readily accessible to actors because Mitchell himself was a consummate performer of his own poetry, acutely aware of the effect of rhythm and rhyme. He and Gogol seem to be made of the same stuff. It is especially poignant that Adrian Mitchell died prematurely just over 2 years ago, and we dedicate this production to his memory. I sincerely hope he would have loved it.

(And no, I didn't get paid to write this. I'm covering this because this technology appears to be a viable lifesaving invention.)\n\nThe Xenex Germ-Zapping Robot uses pulsed xenon-generated UV light to achieve what the company calls \"the advanced environmental cleaning of healthcare facilities.\" Because ultraviolet light destroys the integrity of the RNA that viruses are made of, it renders viruses \"dead.\" (Viruses aren't really alive in the first place, technically speaking, so the correct term is \"nonviable.\")\n\nEbola, just like most other viruses, are quickly destroyed by UV light. That's why Ebola likes to spread in dark places where sunlight doesn't reach. (Think of Ebola as a \"vampire\" virus that feeds off human blood but shuns sunlight...) The Xenex robot destroys Ebola on surfaces in just two minutes, zapping them with a specific wavelength of UV light at concentrations that are 25,000 times higher than natural sunlight.\n\n\nKill Ebola with electricity and UV light; no toxic chemicals needed\n\nThe reason I'm covering this medical technology is because I'm seriously impressed with the concept and the green technology behind it. The Xenex unit generates UV light using xenon -- one of the noble gases -- rather than toxic mercury. So there's no toxic mercury to deal with, even when disposing of the equipment after its useful life.\n\nSo many of the approaches to disinfection in hospitals today are based on harsh, toxic chemicals that pose a secondary risk to the health of hospital patients and staff. But UV light emitted by the Xenex robot leaves no chemical residue whatsoever and requires no chemical manufacturing plant to manufacture. This is truly \"light medicine\" because it disinfects using specific frequencies of light.\n\nStudies touted by the manufacturer appear to show extraordinary disinfection results spanning both bacterial superbugs and viral strains:\n\n- 57% reduction in MRSA at Moses Cone\n\n- 53% reduction in C.diff infections at Cooley Dickenson\n\n- 50% reduction in bacterial contamination at Cambridge Health Alliance\n\n- 30% reduction in C.diff at the MD Anderson Cancer Center\n\n- 62% reduction in microbial load at the St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center\n\nAlready in 250 hospitals and growing...\n\nThe Xenex UV robot is already being used in about 250 hospitals. That number is likely to increase dramatically due to the current global Ebola outbreak.\n\nThe base price of the Xenex unit is around $100,000, and the unit pays for itself very quickly by preventing expensive infections.

Three videos use a mix of live-action scenes and colorful animation featuring Wise Owl and his niece Wendy. An interactive format uses video pauses that allow viewers to share ideas and discuss what characters should do next. The kit also contains three colorful posters that visually reinforce the program's key messages as well as a Teacher's Resource Book with cooperative learning games and illustrated hands-on activities.\n\nEach of the three videos relates to a different drug safety question:\n\nIs That Good for Me?\nIn this video, viewers learn how choices\u2014such as what to eat and when to go to bed\u2014can affect our minds and bodies, either positively or negatively. After Wendy and Wise Owl illustrate the benefits of healthy decisions, viewers are asked to consider a scene where alcohol is present. This introduces the concept of dangerous substances like alcohol and tobacco. The positive effects of healthy decisions are also related to social skills and friendship. \n\nWhat Is a Drug?\nThis video introduces the term drug and specifically relates it to alcohol and tobacco. The harmful effects of these substances are carefully described in age-appropriate graphic segments and live-action scenarios. Viewers are asked to share ideas about other dangerous drugs and why it's important to avoid them. Each scene also emphasizes the benefits of a healthy, drug-free lifestyle.\n\nWhat Is Medicine?\nIn this video, viewers learn that medicines and other substances, like vitamins, can be helpful. At the same time, scenarios clearly illustrate the dangers of using medicines incorrectly. Viewers learn who is allowed to give them medicines, when medicines should be taken and how to take them safely. Viewers are also encouraged to ask permission before touching or tasting any substance, even one that looks like food. \n\nWise Owl's Drug Safety Kit also includes:\n\nTeacher's Resource Book with pre/post test\nFilled with a variety of age-appropriate activities to further learning.\n\n3 Full-Color Posters\nEach poster reinforces an important message from the videos with colorful illustrations of young people and the animated characters Wise Owl and Wendy. \n\n\"Healthy or Not?\" Cards\nBased on a similar Wise Owl video segment, each 5 x7 card features an object or activity that students can identify as \"healthy\" or \"not.\" The back of each card features questions and discussion prompts to guide the teacher. \n\n60 Wise Owl Stickers \nColorful stickers are presented to students when they practice healthy behaviors modeled in the videos. Examples include, I exercised, I made a safe choice, and I got plenty of sleep.\n\nReproducible Activity Sheets", "title": "Wise Owl's Drug Safety Kit:  What is a Medicine?", "publishedDate": "2012-01-10T17:55:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9OK6tQjdcVY", "description": "by Giannis Pantelidis\ncamera Ioanna mk mk\ntattoo artist Kostas Stamoulis\nTattoo studio Smokink Guns", "title": "portrait of woman angel and deadness tattoo by kostas", "publishedDate": "2014-04-23T16:16:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "9OKBuDYWvsw", "description": "http://www.m-yfilms.blogspot.com/\n\nThis short tongue-in-cheek advert was featured in the middle of a Hepatitis C awareness video that I shot and edited at HMP Wayland in 2004 (and updated in 2010).\n\nThe project was scripted by HMP Wayland's Hep C Support Group,with additional material from myself, and won 2 Koestler Trust awards.", "title": "HMP Wayland - aka - Wayland Sports and Social Center (2004)", "publishedDate": "2010-02-19T02:01:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "9OKZzmqdgjk", "description": "Video game intro for Gunboat for Amiga.\nLiked this intro?

Over the past 4 years, the German music creator has warmed the trance scene with several strong, Balearic trance productions. Whether played out in their dance versions for the ten thousands of clubbers, or slipped into the ears through home speakers or headphones in the chilled out lounge versions, Shah's tracks have pleased crowds all across the globe. \n\nShah released some of his biggest productions under the Sunlounger moniker. The very first Sunlounger track, 'White Sand' turned the heads and made the trance scene wonder who managed to capture the Balearic spirit so perfectly. Their need to hear more was fulfilled with two complete Sunlounger albums, 'Another Day On The Terrace' in 2007, followed by 'Sunny Tales' in 2008. \n\n'Sunlounger - The Downtempo Edition' is a collection of the chill versions of the tracks of both albums. 24 guitar-driven, melodic infusions of pure sunlight captured in beats, synths and the true Shah sound. Relax, ease your mind and slip this one into your player. Let the Balearic senses take over completely, with Sunlounger as your guide.  \n\nFor more information visit:\nhttp://www.armadamusic.com\nhttp://www.armadadownloads.com", "title": "Sunlounger feat.

Recently, scientific research has confirmed a strong connection between the protective nutrients found in maqui berries and richer, disease-free mode of living.\n\nThe Power of Maqui\n\nWith an amazingly high ORAC value, maqui berries offer more antioxidants than any discovered fruit -- with a particularly high potency of anti-aging flavonoids like anthocyanins and polyphenols. Recent studies have demonstrated these antioxidants to support a wide variety of bodily functions, including improved brain performance, heart health, liver strength, anticancer activity and -- as the Machupe Indians likely know -- overall longevity. Plus, the fruit offers a premium source of vitamin C, calcium, iron, potassium, and is a natural anti-inflammatory food.\n\nAntioxidant Advantage\n\nWith such a profoundly rich supply of health-improving phytochemicals, even using just small amounts of maqui powder will vastly enhance the nutritional benefits of other foods or recipes.
