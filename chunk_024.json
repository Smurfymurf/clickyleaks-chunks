This is based on a gross misrepresentation of the Ahmadiyya views and I would like to present the following to remove this misunderstanding. \nAt the very outset I would like to state categorically that Ahmadies believe the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of God be upon him) to be Khataman Nabiyyeen - Seal of the Prophets, as has been stated in the Holy Quran and it is an awful fabrication against the Ahmadies that they do not believe in the doctrine of Khatm-i-Nabuwwat. The difference is only in interpretation of the title and not in the title itself. \n\nThe Promised Messiah and Mahdi, the Holy Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam (peace be upon him) says: \n\n\"I swear by the glory of God and His Majesty that I am of the faithful, a Muslim and I believe in Allah, the High, in His Books, and in His Messengers and in His Angels and in Life after death. And I believe that our Prophet Muhammad the Elect of God (peace of Allah be on him and His blessings) is the most eminent of the prophets and the Seal of Apostles.\" (Hamamatul Bushra, page 6) \nHe again says: \n\"The charge made against me and my Community that we do not believe the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and His blessings) to be the Seal of Prophets is a big falsehood. The faith, the conviction, certitude and the utterness that characterize our belief in the Holy Prophet as the Seal of Prophets, are markedly absent in the belief of these people (those who level this charge at us).\" (Al-Hakam, March 19, 1905) \nMany Muslims believe that the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of God be on him) is the last prophet and that no prophet can come after him. I shall first state and examine the arguments that are given in support of this belief, then show that this is true only in a certain sense. \nThe Holy Quran says: \"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Apostle of Allah and Khataman Nabiyyeen--The Seal of the Prophets.\" (33:41) \n\nThe real meaning of Khatam is a seal (see Tajul Aroos, Lisanul Arab, and Qamoos), and the phrase should be interpreted in the light of this meaning. Ibn Khaldun says it is wrong to interpret the word Khatam in this verse to mean the last or the end (see Muqaddama Vol. II, p. 54, Paris). He holds that the word Khatam denotes the consummation and completion of a thing, which he further explains by the words, authenticity, perfection and validity. When a seal is put to a letter it becomes authentic and complete. The seal may be put in the end or in the beginning. According to him, therefore, Khataman Nabiyyeen would mean the truest and the most perfect of prophets and not the last in point of time. It refers to his status and place among the prophets and not to the time of his advent.\n\nFor more details:\nhttp://www.alislam.org/library/finality.html", "title": "Concept of Khatm - e - nabuwat - Explained Part 3", "publishedDate": "2010-08-13T23:07:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "0SIBh7kooJo", "description": "Goodness, this is the most catchy utau original I've heard next to Sky High.

It seems like pretty much everyone has heard the word on the street --Mefjus is a prodigy of drum and bass that you cannot await for the next production to surface. And this time you can believe the hype, whatever discipline of drum and bass -- Mefjus masters them all. Sound design and songwriting, originality and suspense -- it\u00b4s all here. \n\nLead track \u201eDouble Tap\" opens with a big movie score intro and rolls out with great drums after the drop. The bass stabs gave the track its name - two well-aimed shots are fired at the same target with very little time in between, in this case bass stabs shots that hit the dancefloor hard. \n\n\u201eBilateral\" on the flip has a more experimental rhythm making use of triplets a lot. Combined with fresh and unheard sounds this one is strictly for the heads. As the title suggests \n\n\u201eDogs and Frogs\" hints at the state of mind that music is made here, all for fun and not for study -- or does it refer to the huge sounds that croak from the speakers? If you prefer dance to it like a dog and jump like a frog, in any case this one is another dancefloor sureshot straight from the jungle. \n\n\u201eOut of Scale\" (Mefjus remix) is closing this ep with a bang. The orginal by Wintermute was released on Trust in Music sister label \u201eKatakis\". The rework convinces with an original drumbeat, the trademark Mefjus \"high pitched snare\" and lots of switches -- all built around this twisted winding lead sound that is known so well from the original.\n\nOut on September 10th 2012\n\n12\" vinyl:\n\n1.

You can remove the unsightly blemish with simple ingredients and persistence.\n\n\nStep 1: Use borax and lemon juice\nMake a paste by mixing borax and lemon juice and apply it to the rust stain. Allow the paste to dry and then rinse it down the drain.\n\nStep 2: Try cream of tartar\nMake a paste by combining a mild scouring powder, cream of tartar, and hydrogen peroxide. Apply the paste to the rust stain and let it sit for 30 minutes. Then rinse the paste away.\n\nStep 3: Use TSP\nDissolve 2 to 3 tablespoons of trisodium phosphate, or TSP, in a gallon of water, stop the drain, and pour the solution over the stain. Then scrub the rust mark with a sponge or rag. When the stain is removed, thoroughly rinse the sink and fixtures.\n\nTip\nWear chemical-resistant rubber gloves when using trisodium phosphate.\n\nStep 4: Use oxalic acid\nCombine one part oxalic acid to 10 parts water. Apply the solution to the rust stain and then thoroughly rinse.\n\nStep 5: Use a pumice stone\nRun warm water over a pumice stone so that it absorbs some of the water and softens. Then scrub the rust stain with the stone.

If you are, then this is for you.\nConveyancing is the process of transferring the legal title in land -- such as a property or a home -- from one party to another.\nA standard conveyancing transaction involves three individual stages:\n1. Completing the contract\n2. Processes involved before the transaction\n3. Processes involved after the transaction\nYou should consult a Sunshine Coast conveyancing professional if you are:\n1. Buying or selling a property\n2. Subdividing a property\n3. Updating a title (for example, after a divorce)\n4. Registering, altering, or removing an easement\nConveyancing on the Sunshine Coast will differ slightly depending on whether you are buying or selling. \nFor a buyer, our Sunshine Coast conveyancing team will:\n1. Prepare, explain, and submit legal documents, including the contract of sale and the transfer documents\n2. Research the details concerning the property and its certificate of title and check for easements, type of title, and other issues that may need addressing before the transaction takes place\n3. Place your deposit in a trust account\n4. Gauge the change of rates and taxes\n5. Assist in the settlement process: during settlement, your conveyancer can act on your behalf, advise you of when the settlement is finalised, and contact your bank or other financial institution to advise when the final payments will be made\n6. Represent your interest in the property with the seller or the seller's agent\nFor a seller, our Sunshine Coast conveyancing team will:\n1. Complete all legal documents and ensure that they are all in order\n2. Represent you and respond to the buyer's requests on your behalf: for example, you may wish to extend dates and deadlines or you might receive questions concerning the property title\nThe transfer of land is extremely complicated and absolutely must be completed correctly by our experienced Sunshine Coast conveyancing professionals.\nFollow us on social media to get regular Sunshine Coast conveyancing updates and click the link below this video to get a free estimate of costs delivered instantly to your email inbox.", "title": "Conveyancing Sunshine Coast", "publishedDate": "2014-03-06T07:06:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "0SWLtHOLNmg", "description": "Label: PGP RTS\n\nZabranjeno svako kopiranje video i/ili audio snimaka i postavljanje na druge kanale!\n\nMusic: \nlyrics:  \nArr:     \nVideo:", "title": "Esma Redzepova - Basal basal seljadin - (Audio 1975) HD", "publishedDate": "2014-08-12T13:22:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "0SWNNk4S0Eo", "description": "Female baboons flirting for attention... and maybe something more.", "title": "Chacma Baboon (www.wildafri.com)", "publishedDate": "2010-11-23T11:55:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "0SWfBO5WH9M", "description": "Ayla gives a lesson to her disrespectful date.\n\nVisit our official website!\nhttp://www.abs-cbn.com\nhttp://www.push.com.ph\n\nFacebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/ABSCBNnetwork\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ABSCBN\nhttps://twitter.com/abscbndotcom\n\nYouTube:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ABSCBNOnline\n\nIf you are in the Philippines, watch the full episode on IWanTV! http://www.iwantv.com.ph\nIf you are outside the Philippines, watch the full episode on TFC.tv! http://www.tfc.tv", "title": "MOON OF DESIRE Episode : Escape", "publishedDate": "2014-04-01T11:17:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "0SX7OMSEUSI", "description": "Dead Wrong by Enemy Mind from their 2008 self titled.

Their trapping mechanism has also been described as a \"mouse trap\" or \"man trap\", based on their shape or rapid movement. However, the term snap trap is preferred as other designations are misleading, particularly with respect to the intended prey. Aldrovanda is aquatic and specialised in catching small invertebrates; Dionaea is terrestrial and catches a variety of arthropods, including spiders.\nCarnivorous plants (sometimes called insectivorous plants) are plants that derive some or most of their nutrients (but not energy) from trapping and consuming animals or protozoans, typically insects and other arthropods. Carnivorous plants appear adapted to grow in places where the soil is thin or poor in nutrients, especially nitrogen, such as acidic bogs and rock outcroppings.

Patterson, an aerospace engineer, according to the video.\nBushman then detailed incidents with aliens at Roswell presenting what he said was photo evidence of the extraterrestrial beings.\n\u201cThey were approximately four and a half to five feet tall,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have three back bones. They\u2019re actually cartilage.\u201d\nBushman said that the aliens had fingers and toes like humans, but claimed they communicated in a much more advanced way.\n\u201cThey\u2019re able to use their own voice by telepathy to talk to you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou walk in the room with one of them, and all of a sudden you find yourself giving the answer to your question in your own voice.\u201d\nAccording to Bushman, there are two types of aliens.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a cattle ranch,\u201d he said, noting that some could live for more than 200 years. \u201cOne group is wranglers, and the others are rustlers the stealers of cattle.\nBushman said that the wranglers are \u201cmuch more friendly and have a better relationship with us.\u201d He also said that the alien planet is some 65 light-years away from Earth, but can be traveled to in under an hour using alien technology.\nAccording to a Texas news outlet, a biography accessed through an Internet archiving site appeared to validate claims that Bushman worked at Lockheed Martin, saying he worked in advanced aircraft concepts.\n\nReferences:\nhttp://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/10/31/on-deathbed-former-lockheed-martin-engineer-with-top-secret-clearance-opens-up-about-aliens/\n\nhttp://www.inquisitr.com/1569327/ufos-are-real-top-area-51-scientist-reveals-in-deathbed-video-18-aliens-work-for-u-s-govt/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated terms:\nalien artifacts alien greys aliens ancient astronauts Anunnaki Apocalypse Area 51 asteroid astral projection astral travel astral world astronaut Atlantis ATS Black ops fallen angel fallen angels cataclysm CIA galactic federation of lights conspiracy crop circles Crystal skull disclosure Egyptian  Sumerian end of the world end of times ET technology ETs Experiments Extraterrestrial extra terrestrial contact extra terrestrial life extra terrestrial planet shadow people shadow person ghost haunting haunted house FBI flying rods flying saucer miracle miracles angel angels HAARP Conspiracy theory how to survive nukes Maya calendar Maya prophecies military Mysteries Mysterious Lights Mystery`s NASA Nibiru new world order News planet Nostradamus nuclear bases numerology Objects near the sun orb orbs paranormal Phoenix lights Planet X ancient prophecies prophecy Psychic Phenomenon Red planet Religion reptilian reptilians Roswell 1947 Secret aircraft sky fish Solar maximum Space supernatural surviving Disclosure Time traveler time travel time machine UFO disclosure UFO's unidentified  coast to coast am near death experience near death experiences NDE NDE's angel angels demon demons haunted haunting heaven hell bible code Virgin Mary web bot Loch Ness monster Nessy Sasquatch bigfoot secret society heaven sighting caught on camera strange odd weird creature creatures unknown guardian angel miracle miracles freemasonry freemason unidentified unidentifiable unidentified creature strange creature strange object unidentified animal unidentified object harpazo caught on video caught on camera isil isis obama ebola virus blood moon rapture boyd bushman ufo video boyd bushman aliens boyd bushman area 51 boyd bushman death bed confession boyd bushman deathbed confession boyd bushman deathbed video boyd bushman death bed video boyd bushman last video boyd bushman alien video boyd bushman alien photos boyd bushman ufo photos area 51 scientist boyd bushman alien confession boyd bushman interview boyd bushman last interview boyd bushmans deathbed confession boyd bushman's deathbed confession ufo's alien's boyd bushman ufo boyd bushman alien coast to coast am", "title": "Evidence for UFOs & Aliens Revealed by Lockheed Martin Engineer Boyd Bushman", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T09:21:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "0SkaCmZEHds", "description": "Keke Palmer performs to Ty Dolla $ign \"Type of Sh*t I Hate\" (Explicit) with choreography by Rosero McCoy. \n\nDirected by: Tim Milgram", "title": "Keke Palmer - Type of Sh*t I Hate - Choreography (Explicit)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-10T15:56:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Skchr5F7bw", "description": "Spot spo\u0142eczny \"Sp\u00f3jrz inaczej na osoby niewidome 2014\"", "title": "Niewidomi z Lasek spot spo\u0142eczny 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T08:56:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Ske8gCxhAk", "description": "", "title": "Goldenrod / Solidago sp", "publishedDate": "2013-12-15T06:12:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Skeucpa1zg", "description": "Quick tutorial on left- hand and right- hand spin on the cue ball and what uses it has.

She was mated once on Mar 24 and had no signs of contractions at 63rd day. I thought it was an easy surgery and predicted 30 minutes. Instead, all 6 pups were not crying but just moving their tongues despite head swinging and massage for more than 8 minutes. So, the whole surgery took 2 hours from 7 pm to 9 pm with much time reviving the pups. On the next morning, the owners told me that all 6 pups were suckling the dam and were OK. \n\nAll 6 pups would have died without resuscitation and so it was miraculous that the first pup cried loudly some 15 minutes after the first pup delivery.  \n\nAfter completion of surgery some 90 minutes later, I thought the largest pup would not survive as he had not cried but was just moving his tongue. His nose was cyanotic and he only moved his tongue and was life-less. \n\n5/6 survived. Good results. I put the pup's mouth into my mouth and blew into his lungs to inflate them after another round of head swinging to remove the mucus. I heard a crackling sound of the lungs opening. Surprisingly, he started to breathe normally.  . \n\nNever predict when Caesarean section will be completed as there may be complications as in this case as much time is just spent massaging the pups to make them cry. The home breeder couple from Woodlands were most happy with the outcome which is never guaranteed. Head swinging around 6 times just after delivery, massaging to back of the neck vigorously with the head down, tickling the hard palate, clearing the nose of fluids from the lungs and when necessary as in the large pup, blowing air into the lungs (mouth-to-mouth) which may not be every vet's cup of tea.

This story is a universal lesson of pure reality. Budka illuminates these stories by replacing the cold, lifeless lithographer's stone with swelling, breathing wood - wood that already has its own life story embedded within its grain. The wood absorbs Budka's drawings and incantations, forming an emotive picture of primal instincts, a cosmos of natural reactions - pain, frustration, animality, sexuality and love. But it is the skin that tells the body's story. In Budka's work the wood is the body and the paper becomes the skin that retains and maps the imprint of affectivity within the matrix of its own cellular structure.\n\nPioneering an Earth-friendly approach to the lithographic process, the alchemy of Mokulito allows Ewa to substitute water for chemicals.

If instead a geodesic grid is used, the positive curvature of the sphere makes itself known in the form of pinch-points, discontinuities, or poles. The icoasahedron distributes the curvature most evenly (in 12 equidistant points). The CA rules shown here were discovered through an interactive evolution tool. The emergent gliders are shown both on the periodic rectangle as well as on a geodesic grid. The curvature concentrated at the icosahedral points can be seen to warp the glider paths, and cause unique interactions.

Its total sales in both America and Europe reached 500,000 copies.[8] It convinced many colonists, including George Washington and John Adams, to seek redress in political independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and argued strongly against any compromise short of independence.

Orb i orange f\u00e4rg/Orb orange in colour. Maybe MUFON Orange County, 16835 Algonquin St. #248, Huntington Beach, CA 92649, USA, should look at this? You can hear a strange voice in the background: \"...and notice that it appears at two places at once\".\n\nBilocation - (1) The ability of a person or spirit to appear to be in two places at the same time. Especially during incidents of astral projection. (2) The art of being able to be at two places at once.\n\nCrow - (1) Since Crow is the keeper of sacred law, Crow can \"bend\" the laws of the physical universe and \"shape shift\". This abilty is rare and unique. Few adepts exist in today's world, and fewer still have mastered Crow's art of shape shifting. This art includes doubling, or being in two places at one time consciously; taking on another physical form, and becoming the \"fly on the wall\" to observe what is happening far away. (2) Native peoples consider the crow a shape-shifter (someone or something that has the abilty to expand into other realms of consciousness). The shape-shifter can be in two places at once and take on other physical forms. The crow dwells beyond the realm of time and space. The crow can merge into the past, present, and future and travel in and out of darkness and light. Early alchemists had a similar symbolism, associating the crow with the \"initial\" state that embodies both matter and spirit.\n\nDeath Omen - Usually, a death omen is an indicator that the person who is visited by it is going to die. Sometimes the apparition can manifest in several places at once (bilocation).\n\nOcelot - Regeneration through solitude, connection with physical and spiritual worlds, ability to be in two places at once, clear vision, connection to the unseen, at home in the trees and in the water. The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), also known as the dwarf leopard, is a wild cat distributed extensively over South America including the islands of Trinidad and Margarita, Central America, and Mexico. They have been reported as far north as Texas. North of Mexico, they are found regularly only in the extreme southern part of Texas, although there are rare sightings in southern Arizona. The ocelot is similar in appearance to a domestic cat. Its fur resembles that of a clouded leopard or jaguar and was once regarded as particularly valuable. As a result, hundreds of thousands of ocelots were once killed for their fur. The feline was classified a \"vulnerable\" endangered species from 1972 until 1996, and is now rated \"least concern\" by the 2008 IUCN Red List.\n\n\"For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither anything hid, that shall not be known and come to light.\"\nLUKE 8:17\n\nTHIS IS THE CUE I USED TO MAKE CONTACT:\n\nEXTRATERRESTRIAL/PRESENT TIME/AVAILABLE/PRIMARY RESIDENCE", "title": "Orb i f\u00e4rg/Orb in Colour", "publishedDate": "2013-05-04T09:23:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "0TY1PPZ0OHM", "description": "Happy Halloween my Doge\n\nSong:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-ZGAGcJrk", "title": "Wat 2 Spoopy 4 Doge", "publishedDate": "2013-10-31T00:07:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "0TY9UB_zpxw", "description": "Enlarged Mid Great Saphenous Vein with Valve  http://www.venousdoppler.com/", "title": "Phlebology Biosound Esaote MyLab 25 Great Saphenous Vein", "publishedDate": "2008-03-07T21:59:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "0TZac7RqyD8", "description": "Glass Sink Basins.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nGlass Sink | Glass Vessel Sink | Glass Bathroom Sinks ...\nhttps://www.glasssinksonline.com/\nGlass sinks resource for bathroom sinks, vessel glass sink and glass basins - designer kitchen sinks and glass-countertops for artistic luxury interiors!\nVessel Sinks at Lowe's Canada\nwww.lowes.ca \u203a Building Materials \u203a Plumbing \u203a Sinks \u203a Bathroom Sinks\nResults 1 - 40 of 173 - EB_GS Eden Bath Reflections Glass Vessel Sink.

Watch the video for an analysis of the fault and a suggested drill.  It can also help with, Hanging Back, Bad Weight Transfer and keeping the arms in front of your body.\nTranscript\nGood lesson here for golfer junior golfers. One of the most common faults of junior golfers is that they create, creating their speed, they create a very fast hip rotation and transition, that good when your a junior golfer to create some golf head speed, but eventually you need to learn to match up your body and your arms a little more to create some consistency. Using this pair as an example: you can see his first movement in this transition, which it should be, your hips should be going first, too much separation between the speed of the hips and the speed of the arms; the hips are almost, even though the arms are at the top of the back, hips are open to the target, weight is spinning back into the left heel, you can see that by the left toe coming off the grind. The arms get out away from the body, resulting in an open club face. You've got a lot of club faced rotation to catch up, he's got to use his hands very quickly through the ball to square the club face, creates speed but doesn't create much consistency. If you saw a current swing of this player just recently, you'll see that these aspects are improving a lot, but the tendency is still there. There's still a little too much difference between the speed of his hips to the speed of his arms, raise his arms slightly, even though it's better, there's still a tendency for the weight to be spinning back to the left heel, arms to get out away from the body, the club face get little bit open. \nSo improving but still some progress needed. If this is you this is a good drill and I am taking you through from the start. What I what you to do is line up the golf ball with your left toe taking a slightly narrower stance than normal, and we are going to do two things. After we've made our normal backswing we going to step to the side, this will help the weight shift to the left foot. And number two, we are going to step forward, hips to the side and forward.This helps to stabilize the hips and allows the arms to come down, and matching the arms with the body. So now the arms can come down more on plane, closer to the body, club face stays square. So simply can square the club face with the impact with the body rotation rather than the hands and arms having to catch up and rotate the club face quickly. A simple drill for any junior golfers out there, anybody who's struggling with the body, speed, too fast compared to the arm speed, and it can also help with weight shift. Anybody's hanging back on their right foot. Maybe anybody is getting their arms stuck behind their body because again their arms are too slow relative to their body. There's a simple drill for you to be trying in your next practice session and helping to match up your arms to the body.\n\nVisit my Blog:  http://www.swingstation.com \nFind me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/robinsymesgolf  \nFind me on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/robinsymes \nVisit my Academy http://www.rnygi.com \n\nRising Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "title": "Golf Lesson Analysis - Spinning Out Downswing (Fast Hips)", "publishedDate": "2013-12-11T01:18:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "0TmvemVlh60", "description": "Movie made during my internship as maritiem officer.", "title": "Comoros Stream at sea", "publishedDate": "2006-11-27T17:50:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "0TndayxhoWU", "description": "http://www.mslaw.edu\nIn this excerpt from the Massachusetts School of Law's program Books Of Our Time; Dean Lawrence R.

Donate Now!\n\nIn this tutorial, Sandra Johnson, M.D., discusses what patients should know about botox. Please visit our site for more information about other dermatological conditions. \n\n* Botulinum toxin, popularly known as Botox, can be used to reduce facial wrinkles. Can also be used to reduce localized sweating.\n\nBotulinum toxin (Trade Name: Botox) was originally designed to treat muscle spasms. However, in treating facial spasms, it was discovered that Botox could also be used to decrease facial wrinkling. Botulinum toxin injections reduce scowl lines caused by squinting, frowning, or concentrating, reducing the prominence of the scowl lines. In addition, Botulinum toxin can be used to lessen crows' feet, bunny lines, marionette lines and smoker's lines. Botox treatment can also be used to correct facial asymmetry. \n\nBotox is also very successful at reducing excessive localised sweating  (hyperhidrosis), especially in the armpits, and reducing pain associated with Shingles.\n\nDosing\n\nTiny quantities of the Botox are injected directly into the affected muscles. There is very little pain involved where it is used to lessen facial wrinkles. However, Botox injections to reduce sweating -- which are typically administered in the armpit area or even hands -- can be quite painful. Local anesthetic may be used. The effects of Botox generally wear off within a few weeks, but further injections are unnecessary for three to six months.\n\nSide Effects\n\nSide effects of Botulinum toxin may include minor headaches and possibly slight bruising at the site of injection. Injection into the palms, however, can cause muscle weakness and result in temporary clumsiness. In rare instances, sides effects may include ptosis, or a drooping of the eyelid muscle, which typically only lasts a few days and can be treated with iopidine or aproclonidin.\n\nNotes of Precaution\n\n* If you are pregnant or breast feeding, Botulinum toxin injections should be avoided.\n\n* Patients with certain neurological conditions shouldn't use Botox.\n\n* Notify your doctor if you use Aminoglycoside antibiotics, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, or if you use blood-thinning agents, such as aspirin.\n\n* Injections are not always successful. However, retreatment is cautioned against for at least two months.", "title": "Botox: What Patients Should Know", "publishedDate": "2014-01-31T16:30:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Tvl4qaR1YI", "description": "http://tinyurl.com/7ok3zuw\nTable-mate Ii 4-pack Folding Table With Storage Rack.

Mixing arty contrivances such as a strict black-and-white dress code and the guidance of a (possibly imaginary) Svengali named Randy Fitzsimmons with Stooges-inspired rock, the Hives -- Nicholaus Arson, Chris Dangerous, Dr. Matt Destruction, Vigilante Carlstroem, and Howlin' Pelle Almqvist -- formed in 1993 in Fagersta, Sweden, while they were still in their teens. After signing with a subsidiary of the Burning Heart label in 1995, they released their debut EP, Oh Lord! When? How?, the following year. The group switched to Burning Heart for their first full-length, Barely Legal, in 1997; that year they also embarked on their first U.S. tour.\n\nAfter the release of 1998's A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T EP, changes in the band's management put things on hold for a time. However, the Hives returned in 2000 with their second full-length album, Veni Vidi Vicious, which featured the singles \"Hate to Say I Told You So\" and \"Main Offender.\" The album, along with tours with the like-minded International Noise Conspiracy and the Hellacopters, generated serious buzz around the group, leading to praise from stars as diverse as Noel Gallagher and Courtney Love, and a deal with Alan McGee's Poptones label in 2001. In the United States, Gearhead Records reissued Barely Legal, A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T, and Hate to Say I Told You So. More touring and the re-release of their singles in the U.K. culminated with the Top Ten debut of Your New Favourite Band, a compilation of songs from their two previous albums and EPs, upon its release in spring 2002. \n\nThat summer, the Hives returned to the U.S. for another round of live dates before playing the Reading and Leeds festivals, among others. The band spent most of 2003 in the studio and out of the limelight, but they returned with a vengeance in 2004: Your New Favourite Band was reissued in the States by Sire Records; Interscope released the Walk Idiot Walk single and the Hives' third full-length, Tyrannosaurus Hives.

To make chocolate curls or chocolate cigarettes I have a cookie sheet or a brownie pan that I've let sit either in the refrigerator or the freezer just until it's nice and cold. I'm turning it over so I have a nice flat surface to work off of. \n\nMy chocolate is going to go right on, I have my tempered chocolate, right onto the surface. I'm going to use a small offset spatula just to spread it out really nice and thin. Just all over the surface, and you're going to see, because the sheet tray is really nice and cold, it's going to start setting up right away. You can tell when chocolate is starting to set. It'll go from a very shiny, glossy, wet look to start to become mat and thick. \n\nYou can see already, as I spread, my chocolate is starting to cool down. What I'm going to do is keep spreading not really for the purpose of making it any thinner but just for the purpose of continuing to cool it down. \n\nThe next thing I'm going to do is just grab my bench scraper. You can take your chocolate and kind of hold onto the pan a little bit. I'm just going to push it away from me, and what that's going to do is create nice, big, kind of thick, beautiful curls. You want to do this when your chocolate is still slightly warm.\n\nAnd you can see it's a great way also to make cigarettes. Just sort of push away from you. Really nice, big shards, and when I put those on top of, if I have a cake that I've covered really beautifully with a ganache or with any sort of glaze, if I put those curls kind of all on top it's going to be a really beautiful presentation. You can see how nicely they kind of curl right on to each other. It's like self cleaning your cookie sheet. \n\nThat's it. I'm going to save all those. Be careful not to break those up, because they'll break pretty easily. So turn your pan around and do the rest. You can just sort of inch it away from you. Really nice curls. A great technique if you have a block of chocolate you can just take a grater, or a knife, or a peeler, and kind of grate big shards of chocolate in the same way and get those really nice, big pieces.", "title": "How to Make Chocolate Curls | Cake Decorating", "publishedDate": "2013-06-16T18:54:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "0UA5Gqnt5iQ", "description": "The amazing Khodi Dill was in town and was our sacrifice poet on the 28th of November at the Vancouver Youth Poetry Slam.

President Shri Pranab Mukharjee gave away this award in a glittering ceremony on 3rd May 2014.  It is a film for an extremely efficient and precise analysis of the contributions of three renowned scientists in a manner that not only educates today's generation but also provides insights into complex scientific phenomena in an accessible manner. At the turn of the 20th century, the world was witnessing a renaissance in the area of quantum physics through the work of great scientists such as Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Ernest Rutherford or Neils Bohr. Unknown to the world, three Indian scientists were also making significant contributions to the quantum world with revolutionary deductions, interpretations and theories.\n\nDr. Satyendra Nath Bose devised a statistical theory of counting photons - a revelation even to Albert Einstein -- that paved the way for the two great minds to work in tandem in formulating fundamental theories as the Bose-Einstein Statistics and Bose-Einstein Condensate. Boson, the class of particles that obey Bose-Einstein statistics, was named after Dr. S. N. Bose. Sir C. V. Raman gave the world what is known as the Raman effect, which redefined how we see light and colour. Another contemporary, Dr. Meghnad Saha produced an equation that explained stellar radiation and is regarded as one of the fathers of modern astrophysics. All the three scientists started their careers at the Calcutta University, became Fellows of the Royal Society, and Raman was the first and only Indian to be awarded the Nobel Prize for physics. \n\nThe film is a tribute to the three exemplary minds, the significance of whose contributions was of vital importance during that time, and even today with great strides being made in quantum physics, fibre optics, nuclear science or astrophysics. They were not only great scientists, but were rooted to the social and political realities of the time and dedicated their lives to modern science in India. Along with being institutions by themselves, they built stellar institutions in the country that inspired many great scientists of the following generations.", "title": "The Quantum Indians", "publishedDate": "2013-07-29T08:18:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "0UIzFo3-IB0", "description": "Prueba de realtime performance del personaje Noryldo en 3Ds Max.

Jay Inslee on Monday said the state is unhappy with the Department of Energy's plans for cleaning up millions of gallons of nuclear waste at the Hanford Site in eastern Washington.\nA presentation on the cleanup effort was delivered to Inslee by Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz at a meeting in the governor's office in Olympia.\nIn a statement issued after the meeting, Inslee said \"the draft that was shown to us this morning did not contain the comprehensiveness and level of detail that the State has requested for months from our federal partners.\"\nThe governor said he would consult with state Attorney General Bob Ferguson and officials at the state Department of Ecology to determine the state's next actions and that he \"will have more to say on this matter in the coming days.\"\nOn Monday afternoon, Inslee said that before taking the Energy Department to court, the state has judicial and arbitration options it can take to force the federal government to draft a more comprehensive plan for the clean up. He also said he expects some action on this within the next few weeks but would not elaborate.\nFerguson issued a separate statement reiterating that his office is continuing to review the state's legal options for enforcing the federal government's legal obligation to clean up Hanford.\nAn DOE noted that \"technical challenges\" with a key part of the cleanup plan still need to be addressed. \"Given the change in approach required by the technical issues, the Department has provided its plans as currently available, sought the State's feedback, and looks forward to taking that into account and providing additional information in the near-term,\" \nPlutonium production at Hanford started during World War II and continued until the late 1980s, leaving behind a dangerous radioactive legacy. Billions have been spent to date on the cleanup, but the most difficult challenge remains -- how to treat 56 million gallons of highly radioactive waste so that it can be permanently stored for thousands of years.Tanks holding that waste are well beyond their design lifetimes, and at least one massive double-shell tank has been confirmed to be leaking waste from its inner shell. Meanwhile, work on a multi-billion-dollar treatment plant remains on hold after experts raised concerns about its safety. That plant is supposed to convert the liquid waste into solid glass logs through a process called vitrification.\nAlready decades behind schedule, the Hanford cleanup is expected to last at least until the middle of this century, costing taxpayers $2 to $3 billion annually.\nGov. Inslee's::\"Safe and successful cleanup of the nuclear waste stored at Hanford is of utmost priority for the people of Washington state and the Pacific Northwest. The federal government has a moral and legal obligation to oversee the successful cleanup of the waste that remains. Fifty-six million gallons of hazardous and radioactive waste continue to be held in Hanford's storage tanks - now decades beyond their intended use. I and others have called for a comprehensive plan that will lead to an effective cleanup plan. We have eagerly awaited an acceptable plan to protect the public health, the environment of our state and Columbia River. \"As such, I have appreciated the attention that Secretary Moniz has given to Hanford since assuming office last year, and that he has come to Olympia today to present the Energy Department's perspective and a draft cleanup plan. Unfortunately, the draft that was shown to us this morning did not contain the comprehensiveness and level of detail that the State has requested for months from our federal partners. While there are aspects of the plan that have merit, we need to have assurance that the U.S. DOE proposal will lead to a plan that will be acceptable to the State.Full statement from Attorney General Ferguson:\"The Attorney General's Office has a long-standing commitment to the people of Washington to hold the federal government legally accountable for environmental cleanup at Hanford..\"My legal team and I will be reviewing the information we received today\"\"http://www.king5.com/news/hanford/Inslee-State-not-satisfied-with-latest-Hanford-cleanup-plan-250663351.html...\nFAIR USE NOTICE: This video may contain copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Your energy interacts with other people's energy.\n\nYou are most energetic and vibrant when you're in touch with your own energy, experiencing your own subtle energies and feelings\u2014not everyone else's.\n\nBut because you're always interacting with others, you can sometimes take on their negative stuff. You might take responsibility for feelings that aren't yours. You may even get yourself stuck in codependent energy patterns that sabotage your energetic system.\n\nHow to Prevent This\n\nYou have energetic pathways in your body called meridians.\n\nOne of your main pathways is called the central meridian. It runs from your pubic bone to just above your chin.\n\nIf this meridian is healthy and vibrant, it supports your entire subtle energy system in being more healthy and vibrant.\n\nBut if your central meridian is weak, you're vulnerable to taking on other people's negative energy.\n\nThat's why I'm sharing this quick, easy-to-use energy healing technique to support you. Do this before you enter an energetically chaotic situation. Practice it every day to strengthen your central meridian. Stop being a conduit for everyone else's stuff. And experience YOU, not everyone else!\n\nWatch the video and follow along with this simple energy healing exercise:\n\nHow does that exercise feel to you? Do you feel more energized and free to experience your own energy, instead of others'?\n\nWhat tips do YOU have? What do you do to keep your subtle energy system healthy and vibrant? Please leave a comment and share your thoughts.\n\nThis quick exercise can help you and your family. For more support that goes way beyond this, get a copy of my phenomenal energy healing library: Energy Healing 101 and MORE! This home study course includes 14-hour DVD and audio CD support, and 120 pages of written resources.\n\nThere is not other course like this available anywhere.

and all nations shall flow unto it.\n3 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.\n4 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\n5 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.\n6 \u00b6Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.\n7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures;

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "Two or three posies by John Keats", "publishedDate": "2014-02-15T23:57:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "0UjikUUPx2Q", "description": "Shark is the most beautiful animal in the planet.

The species originated about 60 million years ago.\nThe name \"whale shark\" comes from the fish's physiology, being as large as many whales and also a filter feeder like many whale species.The largest confirmed individual had a length of 12.65 metres (41.50 ft) and a weight of more than 21.5 tonnes (47,000 lb), and there are unconfirmed reports of considerably larger whale sharks. Claims of individuals over 14 metres (46 ft) long and weighing at least 30 tonnes (66,000 lb) are not uncommon.\nThe whale shark is found in tropical and warm oceans and lives in the open sea with a lifespan of about 70 years. Although whale sharks have very large mouths, as filter feeders they feed mainly, though not exclusively, on plankton, which are microscopic plants and animals.\nWe've started the petition \"Ban sale/distribution of the shark fins and products containing shark fins\". Shark finning is a horribly cruel act and no creature on earth should have to go through something so horrible! Please, take 1 minute to sign it!

Why I don't like showing just a defensive technique with out a counter is because you make a groove. If you learn how to defend and you don't learn how to counter, right off the bat, it ingrains the wrong muscle memory. We're going to do something, and this is a tribute to Floyd Mayweather, because we love you. All right. You're a great fighter.\n\nWe're going to show them the shoulder roll. He's going to touch here with the shoulder, rip and upper cut, snap back the chin, and then come with three. Touch, again. Again. Let's show them how that looks now, jab jab. Integrating all my shots, one, two. Count, three. Jab, jab. We're going to work an evasive technique where I'm pushing up on Delen, Delen is going to take me, spin me out, work a right hand and a left hook. He's in the clench here. He's going to take my neck, grab the back of my neck, spin me around, pivot, right hand, left hook. Again.\n\nWe're in a clench. This is a defensive move. He's going to spin my neck around, and the body follows the head. So, we're clenched up right here. He's going to take me, spin me, pivot, and come back. One, two, jab, jab. The shoulder bump, execution, boom, ba, ba, ba, jab, jab.\n\nLet's just say we were in a clench, jab jab. Good, one more time. Let's just say we were in a clench here. Nice, jab, jab. So those two techniques I showed you there, one was for in a tall defensive move where he catches the punch on his shoulder, and then he counters with the upper cut and then the right hand left hook, right hand. And the second shot was a defensive move on up and close clench contact where you take the back of the hand, on your opponent's neck, and turn their head. Turn their head.

Its enteric-coated delivery system protects the enzyme activity for optimal and maximum absorption.   Not to mention the consistent quality and low daily dosages.  One bottle of Innerzyme's Pain & Inflammation Blend is a two month supply.\n\nInnerzyme's Pain & Inflammation Blend is a comprehensive blend of proteolytic enzymes, herbs and bioflavonoids.  It is enhanced with Turmeric and White Willow Bark.  \n\nSystemic Enzymes Have 5 Main Functions:\nNatural Anti-inflammatory\nAnti-Fibrin\nBlood Cleansing\nImmune System Modulating\nVirus Fighting \n\nAre you living with pain?  Whether you suffer from daily pain or just overworked your body with strenuous activity, Innerzyme's Pain & Inflammation Blend helps your body respond to pain and swelling safely and effectively.*  \n\nDid you know that nearly all injuries and operations result in inflammatory reactions and build up of excess scar tissue which causes pain and swelling?  It is a natural protective response to injuries and trauma on a cellular level.  However, if the inflammation is not resolved or reduced in the acute stage, it can become a chronic inflammatory problem.\n\nThere are no side effects with Innerzyme's Pain & Inflammation Blend. It is a safe and natural solution for post-operative scar tissue, inflammation and pain whether the surgery was recent or 15 plus years ago.  \n\nCommon Surgeries:\nHip Replacement\nKnee Replacement\nBreast Augmentation\nSports Injuries\nACL Injuries\nBack Surgery\nNeck Surgery\nShoulder Surgery\nOral Surgery\n\nProprietary Enzyme Blend\nOur proprietary blend contains Pancreatin, Papain, Bromelain, Trypsin, Chymotrypsin, Rutin, White Willow Bark and Turmeric root. It is specially formulated to naturally reduce pain, inflammation, excess fibrin and the buildup of excess free radicals.  The delivery system for Innerzyme's Pain & Inflammation Blend is an enteric coated tablet. The enteric coating protects the enzymes from premature release in the acidic region of the stomach allowing maximum absorption and optimal release of the proprietary blend in the pancreatic juices. High potency, minimal dosage with maximum benefit!  When taken on an empty stomach, it is believed that enzymes may help manage inflammation by supporting healthy blood flow to the irritated area.* \n\nBromelain\nBromelain is most notable for its effectiveness in the reduction of inflammation and decreasing swelling, but the scope of its benefits continues to increase.*  Derived from the pineapple fruit, this natural anti-inflammatory has many health benefits. \n\nChymotrypsin\nChymotrypsin is naturally produced by the pancreas in the human body.  The primary uses of chymotrypsin are as a naturally anti-inflammatory and as a digestive aid.  As a natural anti-inflammatory, chymotrypsin may help reduce tissue damage and the formation of fibrin clots during inflammation.* \n\nRecommended Dosage\nTake 2 tablets, twice daily on an empty stomach with water. Depending on the severity of inflammation, this dosage may be increased to 8 tablets daily.*\n\nTurmeric\nTurmeric is an herb, an Indian spice that has been used for many years because of its natural medicinal properties. Turmeric is rich in antioxidants and is a powerful anti-inflammatory. The antioxidant compounds found in turmeric are known as curcuminoids. These compounds have been shown to help reduce the buildup of excess free radicals. They also neutralize existing free radicals by scavenging them.  It also has been shown to support healthy liver function, digestion and inflammatory response.* \n\nRutin\nRutin is a potent bioflavonoid which are water-soluble plant pigments, naturally occurring chemical compounds important to maintaining optimal health.  They support health by protecting and strengthening capillaries, help prevent bruising and provide support for many other biological functions.* \n\nWhite Willow Bark\nWhite Willow has been used for decades because of its pain relieving and fever reducing properties.  White Willow is also thought to support a healthy inflammatory response. \n\nCautions\nIf you are pregnant or lactating, consult a health care practitioner prior to taking this product. \nDo not take this product if you are allergic to aspirin or salicylates; people taking blood thinners should not take this product without consulting with their health care provider.\n\n*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

No words can portray what the eye sees from this majestic and ancient mountain village that has been lost to time for centuries.  One can only imagine the views enjoyed by two reining Kings, Dukes and Baron's from their North and South castellos.  The acqua zolfata spa water is amazing.  Liquid gold.  When the Ancient Greeks' had Sicily, Sclafani*Bagni was the seat, and they found the thermal zolfata water springs so miraculous they dedicated the springs to the god of medicine \"Aesculapius.\"  A 30-40 minute bath and you do not have to sleep that night.

If such a collision happens, the explosion would be 1,000 more powerful the Chelyabinsk meteorite explosion in 2013.\n\nAn automatic telescope installed in Russia\u2019s Caucasus Mountains, near the city of Kislovodsk, first spotted the newly discovered space rock, dubbed 2014 UR116. The asteroid is estimated to be 370 meters in diameter, which is bigger than the size of the notorious Apophis asteroid.\n\n\n\nOnce Russian astronomers saw the new space object, they passed the data to colleagues at the Minor Planet Center of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. That means many observatories around the world closely scrutinized 2014 UR116, which helped to calculate the object\u2019s preliminary orbit.\n\n2014 UR116\u2019s orbit is fluctuating because it also passes close to Venus and Mars, and the gravitational pull of these planets can also influence the asteroid\u2019s trajectory.\n\nWhen a meteorite exploded in the skies above the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in February 2013, the energy of the explosion was estimated to be equivalent to 300-500 kilotons of TNT. But the Chelyabinsk meteorite was relatively small, about 17 meters in diameter and it disintegrated with a blast at an altitude of over 20 kilometers.\n\nThe newly discovered 2014 UR116 is much bigger and its collision with our planet would be catastrophic, as its impact power would be 1,000 times stronger than of the Chelyabinsk meteorite, Scientific Russia journal pointed out.\n\nBut the good news is that the asteroid poses no threat to Earth for at least the next six years, Victor Shor, research associate at the Institute of Applied Astronomy told the Interfax news agency.\n\nAt the moment the closest part of 2014 UR116\u2019s orbit is 4.5 million kilometers from Earth. But this will change, so scientists are going to have to keep an eye on 2014 UR116 for years to come.\n\nhttp://rt.com/news/201827-dangerous-asteroid-discovered-ur116/", "title": "New Asteroid May Threaten Earth! 1,000 Times Stronger Than Chelyabinsk Meteorite!", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T05:23:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VAZ8_1Z_uA", "description": "", "title": "K Ung Intro", "publishedDate": "2013-06-25T05:25:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VAicjqPlFI", "description": "Rekod ini saya jumpe di dalam bilik penulis dan penggubah lagu asal Ombak rindu yang telah direkod pada tahun 2003..

He planned to invade France, and this time to get off the boats.  Most sources agree that he also brought several primitive cannons that probably fired stones or iron shot.\n\nIf you liked this video you might also like the other Hundred Years War battles we have animated:\n\n1340 Sluys Sea Battle:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfSysxGQPnw\n\n1415 Battle of Agincourt:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8LZ5o39KkQ\n\nOn July 12, 1346 King Edward and his army of mostly longbow archers as well as his eldest son, the \"Black Prince\" Edward arrived at the coast of France and disembarked at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue without much resistance.  They spent the next month marching towards Paris, pillaging as they went, before turning north and along the Somme River, pursued by a much larger French army led by King Phillip VI.  With the French army was a large contingent of Italian mercenary crossbow archers who were all called Genoese by the French.  Blind King John of Bohemia and a group of knights also joined the French army.  King John would perish in the next day's battle.  King Phillip would be wounded.\n\nThe English stopped and rested for a day near the village of Crecy, selecting a low ridge to form a line with two wedges of archers at each end, and the dismounted knights massed in the middle.  The next day the French caught up and began to arrive in the plain at the foot of the hill.  It was August 26, 1346.\n\nAfter a brief thunderstorm, the crossbow archers bowstrings were wet, and loose.  The English archers had kept their bows covered and dry during the rain.  The French King ordered his army not to advance, and to stop and rest for the night before offering battle the next day.  But French knights started to advance and even King Phillip changed his mind when he saw how impudent the English looked up on the small hill they occupied.  So he ordered the crossbow archers to advance and begin firing.  He told them to advance without first having their large wooden shields brought up from the rear of the army.  So they advanced and released their first volley into the English lines without protection.  Some sources say that they discharged their bolts early because they were startled by the firing of English cannons, which did little damage, but were an unfamiliar sound and sight to people of the time.\n\nThe crossbow bolts fell short of the English, and in response the English longbows began to unleash volley after volley of deadly arrows that fell into the line of Italian crossbow archers.  The Italians broke and fled, until they ran into the lines of French knights behind them, who were disgusted by the archers' cowardice.  Thanks to http://www.youtube.com/user/GaudrioleProduction1/about from France for providing the voice of the French knight who orders a massacre, and a charge right over the retreating Italian crossbow archers.\n\nThe French mounted knights charged the English lines in wave after wave, and the so did the dismounted men at arms.  The English archers disabled the knights before they ever reached the English, by shooting the French knights' lightly armored horses instead of the knights, whose armor rendered them mostly impervious to the arrows.\n\nFinally by evening King Phillip was persuaded to flee with some retainers, as the battle was lost for the French.", "title": "1346 Lego Battle of Crecy,  Hundred Years War", "publishedDate": "2013-12-16T21:06:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VBGgbf6-h4", "description": "", "title": "Don't burn the witch - Dercein", "publishedDate": "2009-10-25T20:44:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VBO0iXZr3Y", "description": "Lupita Queirolo, coordinadora de Bunko Papalote, nos platica sobre los talleres para padres y ni\u00f1os, con el fin de fomentar la lectura en la pr\u00e1ctica diaria y tener una mayor convivencia.", "title": "Bunko Papalote", "publishedDate": "2014-04-24T20:27:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VBU_bxno5A", "description": "\u2714Slap the LIKE button if you enjoyed the video!\n\u2022Twitter: https://twitter.com/Magixcal\n\u2022Subscribe: http://bit.ly/Sub2Magixcal\n\n------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad--------\u00ad---------------------\u00ad-\u00ad--------\n\n\u2022All of my Playlists:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Magixcal/playlists\n\n\u2022Be sure to LIKE and SHARE the video if you enjoyed\n\n------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad--------\u00ad---------------------\u00ad-\u00ad--------\n\n\u2022Subscribe: http://bit.ly/Sub2Magixcal\n\u2022YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/Magixcal\n\u2022Twitter: https://twitter.com/Magixcal\n\u2022Google+: https://plus.google.com/+Magixcal\n\n\u2022Fan Mail + Business Inquires: magixcal@gmail.com\n\n\u266cMusic Credits: If you would like to know leave a comment.", "title": "Black Ops 2 Zombies \"Ray Gun\" Perma Perk - Buy the Ray Gun Off the Wall (Persistent Perk)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-09T01:21:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VBhKZEpxQ4", "description": "http://www.landscaping.ie/index.php/blog/landscapers-contract-garden-design-woodside-drive-churchtowndublin/\n\nOn initial visit to this landscaping contract, the garden was in a state of disrepair and needed of a lot of landscaping work. This work included removing existing plants, plastering and painting of surrounding walls, removal of materials and rubbish, levelling of lawn, removal of tree stumps. After meeting with the client, discussing the above, the budget and requirements, we came up with the following brief:\n\n-  Large cota brown limestone seating area\n-  Raised bed to double up as seating\n-  Granite cobble mowing edge\n-  New low maintenance planting\n-  New instant roll out lawn\n-  Plastering and painting of surrounding walls\n-  Small lean too shed\n-  Child friendly\n-  Cabelling for future garden lighting\n\nOur landscapers cleared the site of granite boulders, unwanted plants, rubbish and tree stumps and carted everything to the dump.\n\nProfessional plasterers then plastered the surrounding walls with a concrete render.\n\nThe raised bed was  installed using 4\" solids laid flat, to a height of 400mm. The bed was capped with 600x300 silver brush hammered granite to create seating. Before filling with topsoil heavy duty plastic was installed against the back of the bed to protect against moisture for future painting.\n\nThe cota brown limestone patio was created using 600x600 slabs laid in a soldier course parallel to the house. The slabs were laid on a 3:1 cement mix, on top of a 75mm compacted layer of quarry screenings. On the completion the area was 90Msq which allowed plenty of space for the kids bikes, roller skats etc.\n\nOur landscapers then installed the mowing edge using 200x100x50mm tumbled silver granite cobbles. The mowing edge decided the beds and ran the whole circumference of the lawn creating definition and low maintenance. Armoured cable was laid through the beds for future garden lighting.\n\nTwenty tonnes of screened topsoil was spread over the whole lawn area to bring up levels. The soil was heeled in and and raked removing the larger stones. The sod was then laid creating a large lawn ideal for football and other games.\n  \nThe newly plastered walls were then painted in the same colour as the house. This transformed the garden and connected the house to it.\n\nThe planting comprised mostly of hardy shrubs and perennials that would do well in shade and against a North and East facing wall. The plants used included Acer palmatum 'Dissectum Garnet', Epimedium 'Frohnleiten', Heuchera 'Sugar Frosting', Diosma 'Sunset Gold', Sarcoccocca confusa, Astelia 'Silver Shadow', Fatsia japonica, Diosma 'Pink Fountain', Carex 'Everest', Myrtus luma 'Glanleam Gold', Osmanthus heterophyllus 'Variegatus', Carex 'Ice Dancer', Viburnum davidii, Pulmonaria 'E. B. Anderson', Helleborus 'Metallic Blue', Aucuba 'Picturata', Euonymus fortunei 'Emerald Gaiety', Dodonea 'Purpurea', Skimmia 'Fragrant Cloud', Pittosporum 'Tom Thumb', Cornus controversa 'Variegata', Euonymus japonicas 'Microphyllus', Thuja smargard and Erica carnea spp. For hedging we used Prunus luisitanica 'Angustifolia' and for the raised bed we planted Calamagrostis 'Karl Foerster' which will look fantastic later in the season.\n\nThe client was very happy with the results and wrote the following:\n\nI would recommend Kevin for any landscaping or gardening requirements. While we had little gardening experience, we had a clear idea as to what we needed and wanted from our garden. Kevin provided us with expert advice and novel ideas to help transform our garden into exactly what we had wanted and more. Kevin is extremely hard working, thorough and a perfectionist. Thanks so much Kevin for all your hard work.

Atopic eczema, atopic dermatitis, infantile eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, and varicose eczema are but a few of the many types of this skin disorder. The most common type is atopic dermatitis, which is often seen in infants and small children. (Nine out of ten of eczema cases happen in children younger than five years old.) Rarer forms include dyshidrotic eczema, which occurs in warm weather, and nummular eczema, which occurs mostly during winter.\nhttp://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nDuring an eczema flare-up, the person experiences itching and rashes that may be red or brownish, scaly, dry, thick, leathery, crusty or flaky. These may also appear as blisters oozing fluid, or as small, elevated bumps on the skin. In some cases, the skin simply becomes thick, rough and red. When scratched, eczema rashes may be infected, and this can worsen the inflammation. The rashes are often found on the arms, legs, chest, hands, or the face. In children, the rashes typically appear on the cheeks, elbows or knees, especially in skin folds.\n\nEczema is believed to be caused by a hereditary impairment of the immune system. A person with eczema often has family members who also have eczema, asthma or hay fever. The standard treatment is anti-itch topical medications, including anti-histamines. This treatment only relieves the symptoms, and does not cure eczema. There is, in fact, no known cure for eczema. It is a lifelong skin problem that recurs every now and then.\n\nWhile eczema has no cure, there are many management strategies to keep it under control, relieve the itchiness and discomfort, and prolong the time between recurrences. Besides medicinal anti-itch lotions, there too are eczema home remedies and skin care measures that can be used to manage eczema effectively.\n\nEczema home remedies include herbs and natural ingredients that can be made into lotions, pastes or ointments, and then applied on the rashes or affected skin areas. They are proven effective in providing relief from itching and inflammation. The herbal ingredients that may be used include virgin coconut oil, blueberry leaves, mashed papaya seeds, licorice, dandelion leaves, turmeric powder, bitter neem leaves, chamomile, camphor, aloe vera, spearmint leaves, witch hazel and nutmeg. \n\nhttp://www.VanishEczema.net\neczema\nAlternative treatments\ntreatments\nmoisturisers\nmoisturising soap substitutes\nitching\nscratching\nbarrier function\ntopical corticosteroids\ninflammation\nflare-ups of eczema\nInflammation\ndry skin\nLichenification\nantimicrobial medicines\ninfection\nimmunosuppressant medicines\nGamolenic acid\nevening primros extract\nTraditional Chinese herbal medicines\nChinese medicine\nUVB light therapy\nPUVA\npsoralen", "title": "Curing Eczema - 2 Fast Acting Tips on Preventing the Pain and Itching of Eczema", "publishedDate": "2014-02-10T13:44:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VFqSJJu9E8", "description": "MPGomatic.com drops the hammer on a 2013 Dodge Dart GT for a 0-60 MPH acceleration test.\n\nThe 2013 Dodge Dart GT is powered by a 2.4-liter inline four cylinder Tigershark engine with MultiAir.

Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals. For animals, mating strategies include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring.

I almost stepped on these guys in my backyard!!\n\n\n\"The  female wasp will search the ground and tree trunks for a spider, and upon finding one, will sting it, paralyzing the spider. Once the spider is paralyzed, the female wasp will make a burrow or take the spider to a previously made burrow. She will lay one single egg on the abdomen of the spider using her ovipositor, and then enclose the spider in the burrow.[14] The egg will hatch and the larva will feed on the spider, breaking through the integument with its mandibles. The larva has five instar stages before it pupates; no major morphological differences are noted between the first four instars, with the exception of size. At the conclusion of the final instar, the larva will spin a silky cocoon, where it will emerge as an adult either later in the same summer season or will overwinter, depending on the species and the time of year the larva pupates\nAdult Pompilidae are nectar-feeding insects and feed on a variety of plants. The female wasps search for a variety of spiders for their larva to feed on, including wolf spiders (Lycosidae), huntsman spiders (Sparassidae), and baboon spiders (Harpactirinae). As the larva feeds on its host, it saves the vital organs, such as the heart and central nervous system, for last. By waiting until the final larval instar, it ensures the spider will not decompose before the larva has fully developed\"", "title": "Wolf spider on it's way to a slow death thanks to an amazingly strong spider wasp!", "publishedDate": "2013-06-22T01:15:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VQIM_soKq8", "description": "Just Zilch rescues surplus food and we need a truck to pick it all up.

The substrates for these processes are various compounds in the organism's diet or growth media. Not all organisms are able to synthesise all amino acids. For example, humans are able to synthesise only 12 of the 20 standard amino acids.\nA fundamental problem for biological systems is to obtain nitrogen in an easily usable form. This problem is solved by certain microorganisms capable of reducing the inert N\u2261N molecule (nitrogen gas) to two molecules of ammonia in one of the most remarkable reactions in biochemistry. Ammonia is the source of nitrogen for all the amino acids. The carbon backbones come from the glycolytic pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, or the citric acid cycle.\nIn amino acid production, one encounters an important problem in biosynthesis, namely stereochemical control. Because all amino acids except glycine are chiral, biosynthetic pathways must generate the correct isomer with high fidelity. In each of the 19 pathways for the generation of chiral amino acids, the stereochemistry at the \u03b1-carbon atom is established by a transamination reaction that involves pyridoxal phosphate. Almost all the transaminases that catalyze these reactions descend from a common ancestor, illustrating once again that effective solutions to biochemical problems are retained throughout evolution.\nBiosynthetic pathways are often highly regulated such that building-blocks are synthesized only when supplies are low. Very often, a high concentration of the final product of a pathway inhibits the activity of enzymes that function early in the pathway. Often present are allosteric enzymes capable of sensing and responding to concentrations of regulatory species. These enzymes are similar in functional properties to aspartate transcarbamoylase and its regulators. Feedback and allosteric mechanisms ensure that all twenty amino acids are maintained in sufficient amounts for protein synthesis and other processes.", "title": "Amino acid synthesis", "publishedDate": "2014-03-14T19:12:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VVsTLaWY8Y", "description": "Daddy Cookiz du groupe Atomic Spliff envoie des \"GOOD VIBES\" sur cette musique !\nDaddy Cookiz gives you some \"Good Vibes\" on his last track !\n\nRetrouver plus d'infos du groupe sur / Find out more information about the band on :\n\nSITE INTERNET : atomicspliff.wix.com/officiel\nFACEBOOK : www.facebook.com/AtomicSpliffRebelDubz?fref=ts\nTWITTER : twitter.com/AtomicSpliff\n\nRetrouver le travail de Fakeye / Check out Fakeye's work : \nFACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/fakeyeltd\n\nRetrouver le son complet de l'album 54-46 was the diddim de Flash It Up Music : https://flash-it-up-soundmachine.bandcamp.com/album/54-46-was-my-number-riddim-volume-01\n\nEt la page Facebook du label : https://www.facebook.com/flash.it.up.music.label\n\n\n\nGOOD VIBES LYRICS\n\nRefrain :\n\nOn veut des good good vibes, rub a dub et digital\n\nRuff and tuff dans les salles, lyrics radical\n\nOn veut des good good vibes, des paroles originales\n\nSur des beat de bombe de balle, come follow me now man\n\nCouplet :\n\nEt quand le syst\u00e8me de babylon nous pousse au bout du rouleau\n\nEt que le people s\u2019endort et qu\u2019il a la t\u00eate sous l\u2019eau\n\nLes cam\u00e9ras de la ville observent nos moindres sursauts\n\nLa d\u00e9sinformation agit par le biais des journaux\n\nLe commun des mortels croule sous les taxes et les imp\u00f4ts\n\nNos supermarch\u00e9s nous vendent du poison en pots\n\nY\u2019a pas d\u2019alternatives, on rend les jardins ill\u00e9gaux\n\nOn nous oblige a consommer les graines de Monsanto\n\nHey, Dabeledybelecoobelekiz au mic on veut des good vibes, hey\n\nAgain and again and again and again\n\nOn veut des good good vibes\n\nAgain and again and again and again\n\nOn veut des good good vibes\n\nAgain and again and again and again and again\n\nRefrain:\n\nOn veut des good good vibes, rub a dub et digital\n\nRuff and tuff dans les salles, lyrics radical\n\nOn veut des good good vibes, des paroles originales\n\nSur des beat de bombe de balle, come follow me now man\n\nCouplet:\n\nPas de coke, pas de crack, non pas d\u2019amph\u00e9tamines\n\nJ\u2019en ai pas, j\u2019en ai pas besoin, mon son c\u2019est de la vitamine\n\nPour \u00e9clater tous les vampaya, oui toutes les vermines\n\nFaut que ca p\u00e8te dans ta t\u00eate, c\u2019est le rude bwoy de Retinne\n\nC\u2019est pas du rock ni de la danse dans ma voiture man\n\nC\u2019est pas de la techno qui pette a fond dans mon walkman\n\nJ\u2019ai pas besoin de ca car en cas de panne\n\nC\u2019est du raggamuffin, je suis raggavitaminomane !\n\nHey, Dabeledybelecoobelekiz au mic on veut des good vibes, hey\n\nAgain and again and again and again\n\nOn veut des good good vibes\n\nAgain and again and again and again\n\nOn veut des good good vibes\n\nAgain and again and again and again and again\n\nRefrain:\n\nOn veut des good good vibes, rub a dub et digital\n\nRuff and tuff dans les salles, lyrics radical\n\nOn veut des good good vibes, des paroles originales\n\nSur des beat de bombe de balle, come follow me now man", "title": "Atomic Spliff (Daddy Cookiz) - Good Vibes (Official Video Dir. by @FAKEYELTD)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-25T14:58:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VWHU1Hbiz8", "description": "endoscopy of liver infection", "title": "endoscopy of liver infection", "publishedDate": "2014-05-31T14:23:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VWMG_uOQiU", "description": "serpent g\u00e9ant decouvert", "title": "Un Br\u00e9silien d\u00e9couvre un serpent g\u00e9ant , regarder", "publishedDate": "2014-09-25T05:15:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VWYtryf-0s", "description": "", "title": "41 Lancewood Dve Albany Creek", "publishedDate": "2012-05-28T02:55:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VWcG7a3ngQ", "description": "A video of incredibily lucky people and narrow escapes.", "title": "Lucky people and narrow escapes", "publishedDate": "2010-02-18T18:42:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VWpnGUNmrM", "description": "Knife Sheath + + Trophy Guide\nGrade: Bronze Trophy\nDetails: Stealth perk 5 is Silent Shot and it is unlocked by getting 10 silent kills using a silenced handgun.\n\nThis can be done after obtaining the handgun silencer, which is found in Deathshead's compound in Chapter 1.

Conventionally, Hindu literature group into two categories: Shruti - that which is revealed and Smriti - that which is learned. The Vedas constituting shruti, are considered divinely revealed and are thus sacred scripture. Later texts, like the various shastras, itihaasas, and Puranas form smriti. Even though the Bhagavad Gita is a part of the Mahabharata (Itihaasa) and thus a smriti, it is considered to be a shruti text by most Hindus today. All shruti scriptures are composed in Sanskrit.\n\nThere are four vedas (Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda) and each veda has four types of texts associated with it: Samhita (veda proper), Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads. Usually, there are more than one shakha (recension) of a single samhita. For example, Yajurveda has two: shukla Yajurveda and krishna Yajurveda. Sometimes the materials are mixed. For example in the krishna Yajurveda the samhita verses are interspersed with the brahmana material. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is considered as both an aranyaka as well as an upanishad.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

June 16, 2012.\nThe botanical term \"scape\" generally refers to a long internode forming the basal part or the whole of a peduncle. Typically it takes the form of a long, leafless flowering stem rising directly from a bulb, rhizome, or similar subterranean or underwater structure.\nThe scapes of garlic are used as a vegetable.\nIn the purest sense, that of a smooth stem without leaves or branches, a scape is a single internode. It might comprise an entire peduncle with just one flower (eg Tulipa) or just the basal internode of a peduncle. This is in contrast to the typical compound peduncle, which morphologically speaking is derived from a branch, or from an entire shoot.\nA single scape may bear a single flower or many, depending on the species. When it bears more than one flower, there is the terminal part of an inflorescence on top, as in Amaryllis. Compare this with say, the peduncle of Agave, which sensu stricto, is not a scape.\nThe scape of a Taraxacum species\nScapes are found on plants of many families, including Amaryllidaceae, Balsaminaceae, Liliaceae, Papaveraceae, Droseraceae, and Violaceae.

It is used to fetch the 3D coordinates of the hands, shoulders, hip, knees and feet of the users. The application uses this real-time data to create a live 3D skeleton of each user. Each skeleton is then filled with 3D meshes and the rendering is done with Minko.

Calcitonin slows down the activity of the osteoclasts found in bone. This decreases blood calcium levels in your body.\n\nWhen calcium levels decrease, this stimulates the parathyroid gland to release parathyroid hormone. But for the Calcium system to work it must have proper Magnesium levels to function.\n\nContinuing on, as Dr Wilson has stated.\n\n\"The higher the level of hair calcium, in general, the lower the effective activity of the thyroid gland.  This occurs because one of the effects of T3 and T4 is to lower calcium levels in the tissues and at times, in the blood.\n\nAs you can see calcium is crucial for proper thyroid health, but for calcium to properly function it must have its friend magnesium.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO MY PODCAST \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/t...\n\nJoin the Optimal Tribe! \nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...\n\nLET'S CONNECT!\n\nGoogle+ \u25ba https://plus.google.com/1034985094051...\nFacebook \u25ba http://facebook.com/AmeerRosic\nTwitter \u25ba http://twitter.com/AmeerRosic\nLinkedin \u25ba http://linkedin.com/AmeerRosic\nAmeerRosic\u25ba http://www.AmeerRosic.com", "title": "Thyroid Problems The Magnesium Connection", "publishedDate": "2013-07-18T14:30:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "0VekJHxUQVQ", "description": "This is the final part to the better than wolves mod series.

It was first known in the 17th century, later it became a dangerous devil to human life.\n\nAgain Diabetes is differentiated in to two types\u2019 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Diabetes mellitus is mainly caused by deficiency of insulin due to either lack of energy in pancreas (or) any auto-immune disease. While diabetes insipidus is caused by defect in secretion of vasopressin (Antidiuretic hormone) which is secreted from pituitary gland present in hypothalamus.  Its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the kidney and due to this it control the concentration of urine. But its deficiency caused increased water excretion through urine even in low intake of water.\n\nDiabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are unrelated, although they have similar signs and symptoms like excessive thirst and excessive urination. Diabetes mellitus is more common than the Diabetes insipidus. \n\nDIABETES MELLITUS:  There are mainly three types of Diabetes mellitus.\n\nTYPE 1 DIABETES: The body does not produce insulin due to dis-function of pancreas. Such diabetes called as insulin dependent diabetes. People usually develop type-1 diabetes before their 40th year often in early adulthood (or) teenage years.\n\nToday type 1 diabetes has no proper treatment in all over the world.  So these individuals are insulin dependent to rest of their life. Approximately 23 % of all diabetes cases are type \n\n1.COMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\u00fc Unusual weight loss.\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Increased urination (sometimes as often as every hour).\n\u00fc Nausea perhaps vomiting.\n\u00fc Blurred vision.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Dry mouth.\n\u00fc Itching skin.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nTYPE 2 DIABETES:  Globally as of 2013 an estimated 382 million people have type 2 diabetes worldwide. About 90% cases are type 2 diabetes. This is happening due to lack of energy in the pancreas. So that pancreas cannot produce sufficient insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in our body.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES: \n\u00fc Unusual weight loss (or) gain.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Excessive hungry.\n\u00fc Weak eye sight.\n\u00fc Increased urination (especially during night times).\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nGESTATION DIABETES: This type of diabetes usually occurs in pregnant mothers during gestation (pregnancy) period. So there is an increase in high blood sugar in pregnant mother. Most gestational diabetes goes away after child birth, but it does put you at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF GESTATION DIABETES: \n\u00fc Increased urination\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness\n\u00fc Increased thirst\n\u00fc Nausea and vomiting\n\u00fc Blurred vision\n\u00fc Weight loss\n\u00fc Hormonal imbalance\n\u00fc Head aches\n\u00fc Body pain \n\nDIABETES INSIPIDUS: The several forms of diabetes insipidus are:\n\nNEUROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:  Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is more commonly known as central diabetes insipidus. It is caused by the damage of pituitary gland present in hypothalamus region (or) other reasons like autoimmune, infection, surgery, head trauma, and some drugs.\n\nNEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:   Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an improper response of the kidney to ADH, leading to a decrease in     the ability of kidney to concentrate the urine by removing free water.\n\nDIPSOGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:    Dipsogenic diabetes insipidus is defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus. This defect results in the inability for water deficit to trigger vasopressin secretion and thirst. Such patients tend to develop hypernatermia and dehydration without seeking water to drink.\n\nFor more deatles - \n Blog: http://diabetestreatmentinnadipathy.blogspot.in/\nYoutube:http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYxb4HnTMmGJUTHnGsYbafwN-IwYyNFP\n\n www.nadipathy.in\n     Nadipathy Centres \n1.
