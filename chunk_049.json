January 29, 1940. During World War II the RAF Home Command laid 48,158 mines during the entire war in enemy waters and these sank 545 merchant ships of 591,143 tons gross and 217 assorted warships of 147,264 tons displacement.  Over 20,000 additional mines were laid by surface ships and submarines.  The success of these additional mines is not broken out, but \"Naval Weapons of World War Two\" claims that British mines in total sank 1,050 Axis warships and merchant ships and damaged a further 540. As opposed to the successes achieved via offensive mining, it appears that the British greatly overrated the effectiveness of mines as defensive weapons during World War II.  Some 170,000 mines were laid in protective fields by surface ships, the majority in the Iceland and Faeroes passages.  This massive effort resulted in exactly one U-boat (U-647) being sunk and had no appreciable effect on the number of U-boats engaged in anti-commerce operations.  This might have been forecasted by a study of the 1918 Orkney to Norway mine barrier (also known as the North Sea Mine Barrage) which was an expensive failure.  In some ways, these defensive fields restricted the Royal Navy more than the Kriegsmarine.  For example, although the German small battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst were able to traverse the Dover Straits in 1942, the first British capital ship to do so was HMS Warspite, which passed that way only after the Normandy invasion in June 1944.(ref: www.navweaps.com)", "title": "1940 British Minelaying", "publishedDate": "2008-06-23T00:54:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "22IbRq4BqM4", "description": "F\u00e9condation et formation de la membrane de f\u00e9condation.\nClasse de 4\u00e8me, SVT.

The birds then travel with a speed proportional to the mean value for their age, class and progress along the average route, as in Supplementary Video 1. Under this scenario, age-differences in departure times are so large that they fully dictate the order of arrival and older birds always arrive earlier than younger ones. Therefore, the higher speed of 3-6 years olds, shown in Supplementary Video 1, is swamped by the capability to depart early, which is typical of older, more experienced individuals. Note that the migration speeds in Video 1 and 2 have been arranged so that, in both cases, the overall video-duration is 50 seconds, while the relationship between migratory speed and the time lags in sequential departures are always proportional to their observed averages (Video 2 of 10.1038/nature13696).\n\n-  Lifelong migratory strategies\nhttp://www.ebd.csic.es/website1/principal.aspx\n\nLittle is known about how migratory performance develops through life for any organism. The long-term monitoring of individuals through GPS satellite tracking is exploited to combine within-individual and cross-sectional data on 364 migration episodes from 92 individuals of a raptorial bird, aged 1\u201327 years old. The development of migratory behaviour follows a consistent trajectory, and this is promoted by both individual improvements and selective mortality, mainly operating in early life and during the pre-breeding migration. Individuals of different age used different travelling tactics and varied in their ability to exploit tailwinds or to cope with wind drift. All individuals seemed aligned along a race with their contemporary peers, whose outcome was largely determined by the ability to depart early, affecting their subsequent recruitment, reproduction and survival. Understanding how climate change and human action can affect the migration may be the key to managing threatened migrants. informacion[at]ebd.csic.es: Sergio et al (2014) Individual improvements and lifelong mortality shape lifelong migration. Nature. Doi 10.1038/nature13696\n\nReference\nIndividual improvements and selective mortality shape lifelong migratory performance\nNature (2014) doi:10.1038/nature13696\nhttp://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13696.html\n\nAbstract \nBillions of organisms, from bacteria to humans, migrate each year and research on their migration biology is expanding rapidly through ever more sophisticated remote sensing technologies. However, little is known about how migratory performance develops through life for any organism. To date, age variation has been almost systematically simplified into a dichotomous comparison between recently born juveniles at their first migration versus adults of unknown age. These comparisons have regularly highlighted better migratory performance by adults compared with juveniles, but it is unknown whether such variation is gradual or abrupt and whether it is driven by improvements within the individual, by selective mortality of poor performers, or both. Here we exploit the opportunity offered by long-term monitoring of individuals through Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite tracking to combine within-individual and cross-sectional data on 364 migration episodes from 92 individuals of a raptorial bird, aged 1\u201327 years old. We show that the development of migratory behaviour follows a consistent trajectory, more gradual and prolonged than previously appreciated, and that this is promoted by both individual improvements and selective mortality, mainly operating in early life and during the pre-breeding migration. Individuals of different age used different travelling tactics and varied in their ability to exploit tailwinds or to cope with wind drift.

You know when we are talking laziness it's having the ability to do something and not doing it. And the concern with laziness is that oftentimes the things that people are lazy about they can't afford to be lazy about. Our society breeds laziness because we really push ourselves to be accessible and available and on and we were in this very competitive mindset and so I think that a lot of us are confused about the difference between just being plain out exhausted with everything that we need to do and just wanting to check out and actually being lazy. So what I've found when working with clients who are lazy is that there is usually some kind of fear that motivates somebody from taking action. And so when we get to the fear of what's causing that laziness oftentimes we're able to overcome it. Let's say someone has a health condition and they can go to the doctor but they don't go to the doctor; they have health insurance and they have a transportation and they have a license or they have a loved one who is willing to drive them. And instead of making the appointment and following through with the appointment they choose to sit at home and watch reality television all day. Now on the surface we can look at that and say well that's really lazy behavior and it's true. But underneath it what I've found is that there is a fear that going to the doctor could result in a diagnosis or going to the doctor could result in a lifestyle change that they are not ready for. So I look at laziness as more of an avoidance than anything else. I find it to be very unproductive and anytime I am working with a client who is lazy which is rare because a lazy client is typically not motivated to reach out to a coach to get help, we look for the underlying cause.", "title": "How to Overcome Laziness | Better You", "publishedDate": "2012-07-09T07:17:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "22M9DzZAQjk", "description": "", "title": "The Camino Dispute - van god los (live @ caf\u00e9 filet)", "publishedDate": "2010-12-30T22:34:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "22MCebifbMg", "description": "Host Frank Sinatra acknowledges distinguished friends and guests at the 2nd AFI Life Achievement Award: A Tribute To James Cagney (1974).\n\nCONNECT WITH AFI:\nhttp://facebook.com/AmericanFilmInstitute\nhttp://twitter.com/AmericanFilm\nhttp://AFI.com/members\n\nAFI FACEBOOK APP:\nhttp://apps.facebook.com/afiytapp/", "title": "Governor Ronald Reagan & Other Friends at James Cagney AFI Life Achievement Award", "publishedDate": "2010-01-12T21:41:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "22MyXAwUfks", "description": "See it at Hometown Motors of Wausau.

Nang nadiskubre ng isang doktor ang napakabihirang infection sa wakas, ay huli na ang lahat \u2013 at kinailangang tumagal ni Ben nang tatlong linggo sa isang intensive care burn ward, dahil nawalan na siya ng 99 percent ng kanyang kutis.\n\nNaglalabas ang bacteria ng isang toxin, na pinapatay ang outer epidermis, na nawawala at dahil dito ay nae-expose ang laman. Dahil hindi pa fully developed ang immune system ng mga bata, at sila ay may reduced kidney function, mas mabilis silang nabibiktima ng bacteria na ito. Ang kasakitang ito ay maaring magamot ng oral antibiotics.\n\nPero dahil si Ben ay na-misdiagnose para sa allergy sa antibiotics, ay hindi siya nagamot ng labing-walong oras \u2013 at nagkalat sa kanyang katawan ang bacteria.\n\nMaaring mamatay ang mga biktima sa secondary infections o dehydration, dahil nawawalan tayo ng mga fluids at electrolytes kapag nawawalan tayo ng kutis. Buti na lang at makalipas ang tatlong linggong paggamot ay nagpapagaling na si Ben. Siya ay magkakaroon ng mga scar sa kanyang katawan, at nahihirapan siyang kumilos dahil masyado pang mahigpit ang kanyang kutis \u2013 pero nagpapasalamat ang kanyang pamilya ay hindi siya namatay.\n\n\nFor news that's fun and never boring, visit our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/TomoNewsPH\n \nSubscribe to stay updated on all the top stories:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TomoNewsPH\n \nStay connected with us here:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TomoNewsPH 2014 ROKETNEWS,2014 ,ROKETNEWS", "title": "Batang lalake, nawalan ng kutis sa isang napakabihirang skin disease! 2014 ROKETNEWS", "publishedDate": "2014-11-02T10:36:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "22VXNIUXwuQ", "description": "", "title": "Erkeklerde genital si\u011fil nas\u0131l tedavi edilir?", "publishedDate": "2014-01-27T22:49:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "22VhTc1qx_Q", "description": "free keylogger key logger software freeware download keystroke recorder software shareware http://www.drpusoftware.com how to record keystrokes logger software freeware download free keylogger key logger software tool tools keylogger software shareware key logger downloads keylogger monitoring software spy key logger software utility utilities free remote keylogger software free stealth keylogger software shareware hidden keylogger\n\nhttp://www.drpusoftware.com", "title": "free keylogger key logger software freeware download keystroke recorder software shareware", "publishedDate": "2012-09-21T07:27:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "22W753joAnA", "description": "An animation about how a forced circulation evaporator works.", "title": "Animation Forced Circulation evaporator", "publishedDate": "2010-10-12T08:43:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "22WHF6g1fVw", "description": "Eucharist & Ecumenism.

It is classified as Critically Endangered. Once relatively common, Spotted Handfish became extremely rare after the arrival of the Pacific Seastar (Asterias amurensis)  - an introduced marine pest that arrived in the Derwent Estuary in the 1980's, probably via ballast water in commercial shipping. The Seastars devastated the marine life in the region and in particular, destroyed the stalked ascidian colonies the Spotted Handfish most commonly attach their eggs to. It was feared that the Spotted Handfish had become extinct in the 1990's, but a small population has survived. It is considered Critically Endangered, and extremely vulnerable to habitat destruction and climate change due to its small population and restricted distribution.\nHandfish (family Brachionichthyidae) are a primitive family related to the anglerfish and frogfish, and are found only in southern Australia. They get their name from the way they use their pectoral (side) fins like hands to grip the bottom. They rarely swim - they prefer to walk along the bottom on their fins. They feed on small invertebrates, particularly mysids. \nAll handfish lay egg masses that are brooded by the female, and they hatch as miniatures of the adult - there is no larval dispersal stage. \nFilmed by Michael Baron.

Channel, America Declassified on the Travel Channel, and is a frequent guest on Coast to Coast AM, The Alex Jones Show, and more. \n\nMark Dice is the author of several popular books on secret societies and conspiracies, including The Illuminati: Facts & Fiction, Big Brother: The Orwellian Nightmare Come True, The New World Order, Facts & Fiction, The Resistance Manifesto, and Illuminati in the Music Industry, which are all available in paperback on Amazon.com or e-book on Kindle, iBooks, Nook or Google Play.  While much of Mark's work confirms the existence and continued operation of the Illuminati today, he is also dedicated to debunking conspiracy theories and hoaxes and separating the facts from the fiction; hence the \"Facts & Fiction\" subtitle for several of his books.  He has a bachelor's degree in communication from California State University.\n\nHe enjoys causing trouble for the New World Order, exposing corrupt scumbag politicians, and pointing out Big Brother's prying eyes.  The term \"fighting the New World Order\" is used by Mark to describe some of his activities, and refers to his and others' resistance and opposition (The Resistance) to the overall system of political corruption, illegal wars, elite secret societies, mainstream media, Big Brother and privacy issues; as well as various economic and social issues.  This Resistance involves self-improvement, self-sufficiency, personal responsibility and spiritual growth.\n\nBe sure to subscribe to Mark's YouTube channel, and look him up on Facebook, and Twitter.  http://www.YouTube.com/MarkDice  http://www.Facebook.com/MarkDice  http://www.Twitter.com/MarkDice  http://www.MarkDice.com", "title": "British Rapper Suspected of Killing American Journalist for ISIS", "publishedDate": "2014-08-23T20:11:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "22cfUv7MDtc", "description": "El 25 de enero del 2007 nieva en muchas localidades andaluzas, los titulares del informativo ofrecen im\u00e1genes de nevadas en las provincias de Ja\u00e9n, C\u00f3rdoba o Granada y tras el paso de la presentadora Susana Ruiz comentando la espectacular ca\u00edda de nieve sobre \u00dabeda (Ja\u00e9n), conectamos en directo con el redactor Alfonso Miranda desde esa localidad que recibe en ese momento una simp\u00e1tica cortina de nieve.

Our basic table salt is made by sending water into salt deposits then evaporating. Table salt can be iodised, free flowing or both. \noIodised salt --Iodine, an important element for the regulation of the fluid content of the body, is essential for the thyroid gland to manufacture thyroxin. Iodine deficiency led to health problems such as goitre, myxedema, dry skin, loss of hair and memory, tiredness, sleepiness and loss of muscle tissue. With people across the world, consuming salt on a daily basis, it was decided to iodise salt to ensure adequate iodine intake. \noFree flowing salt--To prevent moisture from being reabsorbed, salt refiners also add alumino-silicate of sodium or yellow prussiate of soda as desiccants plus bleaches to make it free flowing salt. This salt finds it difficult to combine with human body fluids so it causes health disturbances. Instead of buying free flowing salt purchase the usual salt and add ten grains of rice to it. This will absorb the moisture and make the salt free flowing. \n\u2022Kosher Salt -- A coarse salt, Kosher salt is generally evaporated from brine, giving its grains a block-structure. This structure better allows the salt crystals to absorb blood (Jewish law states that you must extract blood from meat before you consume it). Kosher salt is less salty than table salt. \n\u2022Sea Salt --Sea salt is harvested by evaporation, also. Sea salt is not quite as salty as table salt. Sea salt can be either fine grained or coarse grained. Many sea salts include trace minerals like potassium, magnesium, and iodine  these minerals are naturally present, not added. \n\u2022Fleur De Sel --A type of sea salt, Fleur de sels have a higher mineral content than basic table salt, have an ocean like smell and tend to be grayish in color. Fleur de sel comprises the early crystals that start to form across the surface of salt evaporation ponds. This is generally done during the summer months, the time when the sun is strongest. Other types of sea salts include sel gris, esprit du sel, and pink, black, and brown sea salts from India. \n\u2022Rock Salt -- Rock salt is not fine-grained. It is unrefined and has a greyish hue.

You can have a strain or sprain in your inner thigh muscles. Here are some simple stretches to get your groin sprain or strain feeling better. The first stretch is a simple butterfly stretch. Sit on the ground, and put your feet together pulling them towards your body. If you need more of a stretch, you can place your elbows on your inner thighs, and apply gentle pressure downwards. Hold the stretches for 30 seconds, doing 3 of each set. Next, you are going to sit up on your knees in a tall kneeling position. Bring your good leg out in front of you at a 45-degree angle and the lean forward. If that is not enough stretch, you can lean out to the side over your knee. The last stretch is a standing lunge at a 45-degree angle. Point your toes in the direction you are going, and then lean your knee towards your toes. \n\nDISCLAIMER: Doctor Jo is a licensed Physical Therapist and Doctor of Physical Therapy, however, this video is only designed to help you perform the correct technique of exercises that have ALREADY been given to you by your health professional.

Your own therapist will also ensure that you are doing correct techniques with your exercises and stretching. If these techniques aren't done right, they won't help, and they could make things worse.

Departing from their original concept of documenting awesome sea-life phenomenon, they transform their mission to creating awareness of Mexico\u2019s sea-life while creating sustainable livelihoods for the shark fishermen in order to preserve a delicate and critical ecosystem. Mexico Pelagico is the story of an unlikely pairing of interests. It is clear that once you swim alongside sharks, sailfish, dolphin, turtles and even crocodiles, your perspective will never be the same. Mexico Pelagico invites the audience to engage with Mexico\u2019s rich and majestic oceanic treasures, to be inspired and awed to take up the mantle of respect and conservation through ecotourism.\n\nLETTER FROM DIRECTOR\nMexico has a forgotten ecosystem: the mega fauna in the open ocean. This collection of marine life includes sharks, rays, billfish, dolphins, whales, turtles, among others, and in Mexican waters they encounter a variety of threats and opportunities. There is over-exploitation of some species and yet massive sanctuaries and success stories exist out there. But the real problem is the complete oblivion of the general public to this particular topic.\nMexico is privileged because it has the largest congregation of whale sharks and great white sharks in the world. In the seas of Mexico unique events occur, such as the unusual congregation sailfish and striped marlin to devour huge sardine bait balls. However, Mexico is also one of the countries with the highest export of shark fins in the world. These are just tiny strokes of what is happening in the world we decided ended at the shoreline.\nMexico Pelagic is a documentary that tries to show a small layer of the open ocean in Mexico illustrating the positive and negative events that occur. It is a product that condenses three years of exploration, learning and collaborative efforts in pro of the Mexican open ocean. We believe we can and must protect the Mexican pelagic ecosystem by replacing uncontrolled fishing with sustainable ecotourism in partnership with the local community. It is the intent of this film enlighten the public with the majestic splendor of Mexican marine life and incite the public to join the fight to protect the most forgotten and beautiful ecosystem in Mexico.\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nPelagic Life - pelagiclife.org/\nWe are a nonprofit organization dedicated to raising awareness and sustainable protection of the marine biodiversity of Mexico, one of the most diverse countries on the planet.\nVision: Exploration, awareness and promotion:\nExplore and document high quality images of open ocean marine life in Mexico.\nEducate the public about the current status of pelagic life in Mexico and the challenges it faces.\nPromote the sustainable development of communities that depend on pelagic life and encourage the responsible consumption of marine species in Mexico.\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: Jer\u00f3nimo Prieto\nProducer: Jorge Cervera Hauser\nEditor: Rodrigo Palacios\nNarrator: Jose Lavat / Nick Smith\nExecutive Producers: Miguel S\u00e1nchez Navarro, Alejandro Martinez Vertiz, Jeronimo Prieto, Jorge Cervera Hauser\nPhotography: Jer\u00f3nimo Prieto, Jorge Cervera Hauser, Erick Higuera, Eric Cheng, Jeff Liton , Eduardo L\u00f3pez Negrete\nOriginal Score: Eugenio Riveroll, \u00c1lvaro L\u00f3pez PIncheti, Josefono L Telefono\nSound Design: Vasilis Milesis\nAnimator: Mike Uriegas\nColor Correction: Francisco I\u00f1igo, Jorge Cervera Hauser\nGraphic Design: Antonio Sabater, Pita Leon de la Barra\nNarrator Script: Carlos Dragonne\nInterviews: Ana Lagos, Carlos C\u00e9spedes, Rodrigo Friscione, Rene Martinez, Eduardo Martinez Vert\u00edz, Gearado Nasser, Ignacio Armida, Jorge Cervera Hauser, Santiago Martinez Vert\u00edz, Sylvia A.

Hanson, MD, FACP: Let us talk for a minute about the signs and symptoms of lung cancer.  Lung cancer is a very common illness and it is oftentimes seen in people who abuse cigarettes or other forms of tobacco.\n\nSo when a person has a new cough, blood in their sputum, unexplained weight loss, or changed in their voice, they need to inform the patient of this occurrence and the reason for that is, is that lung cancer is a very difficult disease to screen for.\n\nWell, there may be data that certain patients can benefit from Annual CAT scan screening, the majority of patients will develop their cancer in between even a yearly screening and some new symptoms mandate an evaluation.\n\nThe other thing that is important to remember is that the symptoms may not seem to be related to your lungs.  You may suddenly experience a lack of appetite, unexplained weight loss, new pain or swelling in an area that you do not associate with your chest.\n\nSo if you have a change in your physical health and are a smoker, in particular, you should seek an evaluation with a physician.\n\nDavid S.

Instead of high tech innovation, some European and American agricultural researchers are using an old method called a cannula to see exactly what's going on inside the digestive system of their cows. \n\nA hole, also known as a fistula, is cut into the anaesthetized bovine's digestive tract, creating a circular window or porthole, so scientist's can take a close look at the effect of different feeds on the animal.\n\nAfter a cow is anesthetized and undergoes surgery to have the cannula inserted, he or she is given a set time limit to graze, before being examined. Once the period is up, researchers pull the cannula plug and stick their hands inside the opening to remove a portion of what the cow has been eating. It is said the animals cannot feel this process. \n\nThe partially digested material is analyzed to determine which feed provides the best results and energy efficiency. \n\nThe process has been around for well over a century, but animal rights activists are against it. Reportedly only used at research institutions, scientists claim the procedure can ultimately help to reduce the amount of methane gas released by the animals.\n\nTAGS\nabc breaking news, bbc, bbc football, bbc iplayer, bbc news, bbc news america, bbc persian, bbc sport, bbc weather, bbc world news, breaking celebrity news, breaking election news, breaking late news, breaking local news, breaking music news, breaking news, breaking news alerts, breaking news canada, breaking news headlines, breaking news in atlanta, breaking news in nigeria, breaking news india, breaking news pensacola florida, breaking news plane crash, breaking news story, breaking sports news, business expensive news home media world, christian world news, cnn, cnn breaking news, cnn money, cnn news, cnn news breaking news, cnn news world, detroit breaking news, global news, headline, headline news, health care technology news, hot latest global news, internet technology news, las vegas breaking news, latest breaking news, latest celebrity news, latest information technology news, latest music news, latest news, latest news headlines, latest news update, latest sports news, live breaking news, local breaking news, local news today, msn breaking news, nbc breaking news, nbc world news, news of the world, news report us world, news today news, news updated daily, solar technology news, sports news today, technology news, the latest news, today news, us news and world, us news and world report, us news and world report magazine, us news and world report web site, us news world report, world news, world news daily, world news headlines", "title": "Porthole Windows Surgically Placed into Cows' Stomachs", "publishedDate": "2014-05-26T14:17:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "232XrZgfuGs", "description": "Looking around the grounds from outside.

The buoyant hull enables transportation of the unit and all attached machinery to a desired location. Once on location the hull is raised to the required elevation above the sea surface on its legs supported by the sea bed. The legs of such units may be designed to penetrate the sea bed, may be fitted with enlarged sections or footings, or may be attached to a bottom mat. Generally Jackup rigs are not self propelled and rely on tugs or heavy lift ships for transportation.\n\nOperation:\n\nA jackup is a floating barge fitted with long support legs that can be raised or lowered. The jackup is maneuvered (self-propelled or by towing) into location with its legs up and the hull floating on the water. Upon arrival at the work location, the legs are jacked down onto the seafloor. Then \"preloading\" takes place, where the weight of the barge and additional ballast water are used to drive the legs securely into the seabottom so they will not penetrate further while operations are carried out. After preloading, the jacking system is used to raise the entire barge above the water to a predetermined height or \"air gap\", so that wave, tidal and current loading acts only on the relatively slender legs and not on the barge hull.\n\nModern jacking systems use a rack and pinion gear arrangement where the pinion gears are driven by hydraulic or electric motors and the rack is affixed to the legs.\n\nJackup rigs can only be placed in relatively shallow waters, generally less than 400 feet (120 m) of water. However, a specialized class of jackup rigs known as premium or ultra-premium jackups are known to have operational capability in water depths ranging from 500 to 625 feet.", "title": "Jackup Drilling Rig - How Does It Work?", "publishedDate": "2011-11-08T18:26:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "233EE1w83oc", "description": "Location: Wisconsin and Massachusetts Ave., NW.\nNational Cathedral\nWashington, D.C. \nBuilt/Founded: 1907 \nArchitect: George Frederick Bodley \nGoverning body: Protestant Episcopal Church \n\nThe Thirty-first Annual\nNational Acolyte Festival\nOctober 9, 2010\n\nHymn: \"Love Divine, All Loves Excelling\"\n\nAbout the Cathedral:\n\nThe Washington National Cathedral, officially named the Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, is a cathedral of the Episcopal Church located in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States.

The cathedral is the seat of both the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church and its bishop of the Diocese of Washington. \n\nThe Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Foundation, under the leadership of the nine Bishops of Washington, erected the cathedral under a charter passed by the United States Congress on January 6, 1893. Construction began on September 29, 1907, when the foundation stone was laid in the presence of President Theodore Roosevelt and a crowd of more than 20,000, and ended 83 years later when the last finial was placed in the presence of President George H. W. Bush in 1990. The foundation operates and funds the cathedral, which is not funded by the U.S. government.\n\nThe cathedral is located at Massachusetts and Wisconsin Avenues in the northwest quadrant of Washington.

It is very lightweight and easy to push around, and the suction is excellent. I use it on carpet and hard wood floors without any problem. What do I love about it the most? It is so convenient to use that I end up vacuuming every little crumb! I used to dread getting out my old Hoover, dragging it around to the room where I needed it, undoing the cord, finding a plug, and then having to wind the cord back up... now I just pop into the closet, pick up my cordless and go to work! It's really convenient having a second battery on hand, all charged up and ready to go, although I can usually get my entire house vacuumed on one battery. I haven't tried the attachments yet. The only drawback I have found to this vacuum is that the steering takes a little getting used to. It turns on a dime to reach into corners, and it took me a few times out before I was totally comfortable using it in corners and along the underside of the couch.\n\nbest bagged upright vacuum\nwhat is the best upright vacuum cleaner\nbest upright vacuums 2014\nbest lightweight upright vacuum cleaner\nthe best upright vacuum cleaner\nbest hoover upright vacuum\nbest upright bagged vacuum\nwhat are the best upright vacuum cleaners\nbest commercial upright vacuum\nbest upright vacuum cleaners for the money\nbest small upright vacuum\nbest upright vacuum reviews", "title": "the best vacuums for sale ;  Hoover Air Cordless Bagless Upright Vacuum", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T16:59:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "234NTB5rxV0", "description": "From Rent the Movie", "title": "ONE SONG GLORY", "publishedDate": "2009-11-27T20:31:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "234g8new7eo", "description": "", "title": "Novela da barbie gravida capitulo 3", "publishedDate": "2014-07-27T04:11:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "234i4iORrbE", "description": "Music video by The Faith Brothers performing Eventide (A Hymn For Change).", "title": "The Faith Brothers - Eventide (A Hymn For Change)", "publishedDate": "2009-09-06T01:08:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "234yla5PZek", "description": "", "title": "DIASTEMA practice #1", "publishedDate": "2013-05-19T19:04:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "235I4dL2nHw", "description": "Learn to use the scissor and knife tool in Adobe Illustrator CS6.", "title": "Using the Scissors and the Knife Tool in Adobe Illustrator CS6", "publishedDate": "2013-04-03T04:59:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "235OW2_CCwY", "description": "David finds the engineer's star map", "title": "My favorite scene from Prometheus/A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery", "publishedDate": "2012-10-19T23:16:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "235VIztprWU", "description": "Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/FamilyFeudSub\nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/FamilyFeud\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/FamilyFeud\nGo to our website: http://www.familyfeud.com", "title": "A Bigger Package! - Family Feud", "publishedDate": "2012-09-10T20:24:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "235pJgS9WK4", "description": "", "title": "Adios con el corazon cuarteto Fedz morales", "publishedDate": "2013-07-30T04:25:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "236DXeW-ZAw", "description": "For Educational Use Only Fair Use Otolaryngologist Dr. Babak Larian and facial reconstructive surgeon Dr. Babak Azizzadeh illustrate how they performed Jeff s tumor removal operation and reconstructed his face with tissue and fat grafts.", "title": "Otolaryngologist Dr. Babak Larian and facial reconstructive surgeon Dr. Babak Azizzad", "publishedDate": "2013-12-31T10:37:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "236GL09sol0", "description": "Carlos Montesquieu - Diabloo pero que mal me hizo sentir melymel", "title": "Carlos Montesquieu - Diabloo pero que mal me hizo sentir melymel", "publishedDate": "2014-08-03T21:32:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "236LqIBarWQ", "description": "D\u00e9couvrez la formation menant \u00e0 un dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes professionnelles (DEP) en M\u00e9canique automobile du Centre de formation professionnelle Qualitech de la Commission scolaire du Chemin-du-Roy \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.", "title": "La m\u00e9canique automobile, une formation offerte par le Centre de formation professionnelle Qualitech", "publishedDate": "2012-09-24T20:47:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "236nRGrpPbo", "description": "From Bishop Nehru: Nehruvia\n\nYou can download the mixtape here: http://thesuburbandojo.com/albums/\n\nPlease:\nFollow him on soundcloud (https://soundcloud.com/bishopnehru) and show your support.\n\nSubscribe to his channels:\n http://www.youtube.com/user/BishopNehru http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSuburbanDojo\n\nCheck out his social media:\nhttps://twitter.com/BishopNehru\nIG : BishopNehru\nTumblr : http://nehruvia.tumblr.com/", "title": "Bishop Nehru - Languages [prod.

And believe it or not, there is still time to plant so you can add  their color and bold texture to the garden.  Display beds here at the South Mississippi Branch Station in Poplarville exhibit the potential of these foliage plants that is often overlooked.  All are mostly green when first transplanted, and begin to display colorful centers as the colder temperatures set in. An interesting fact is that ornamental kale and cabbage are one and the same species, Brassica oleracea. Ornamental cabbage usually refers to selections that have smooth and more or less unruffled leaves. The Osaka series is a great example with a color range from red, pink and white. Ornamental kale varieties display ruffly and textured leaves. Chidori Red is a good example of having feathered leaf edges along with an inner hearth of glowing embers. I should point out that true red is an elusive color. Most varieties called red are really variations on dark purple to maroon. One of the best kale that has really been a good landscape performer in Mississippi is Redbor. This Mississippi Medallion winner has really crinkly leaves that show off an incredible dark purple/maroon through the cool months. It works well in combination with the ornamental cabbage, since the redbor kale can up to 36 inches tall.  The only real pest problem can be cabbage looper that cause holes in the foliage. These insects are easy to controll with by spraying Bt, which is a natural product.

The cars, both at least 40 years old, were discovered when the Oklahoma Highway Patrol Marine Enforcement division were conducting training sessions involving new sonar technology.\n\nPolice pulled up a blue 1969 Camaro white top which matched the description of the car owned by Jimmy Williams, a 16-year-old last seen on November 20, 1970. Reports said he was heading to a football game with two friends, Thomas Rios and Leah Johnson, both 18, but their plans may have changed and they went for a hunting trip instead. No trace of the car, or any of their bodies, was found after that autumn evening. The three bodies in the Camaro are suspected to belong to the missing teenagers.\n\nThe second car recovered was a 1957 Chevy and it also contained the remains of three people. Police first suspected that the car belonged to a couple last seen in Canute, a town about 10 miles south of the lake, some time in the 1960s. It was later believed, however, that the Chevy was owned by Alvi Porter, a 69-year-old man that went missing in 1969. His granddaughter, Debbie McManamman, said in a television interview that she believed the car to be her grandfather's green Chevy. It is not known who was in the car with him.\n\nThe highway patrol discovered the vehicles on September 10, then went back on a diving mission to investigate. The cars, which were found next to each other, were pulled out on Tuesday.\n\nInternet users from the area have left comments on news sites speculating that the cars may have ended up in that part of the lake due to a particularly dangerous stretch of road near it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nTomoNews is your daily source for top animated news.

The so-called 'A-one Medicine' is the best medicine which does not have any side effects, even after using it for a long time. It can improve one's constitution, increase the body's healing ability to help maintain a healthy body, and have a long life.\n \nMore info:.healthandenergy.dxnnet.com\nEmail: pionnera@gmail.com\nItziar Irazusta\n\nThe magic effects of ganoderma:\n\nGanoderma has always been shrouded with a mysterious curtain for more than a thousand years. People only know ''Ganodermas can keep one young and give one a long life if taken continuously\", but no one had ever scientifically investigated why it is so effective.\nUnder the attentive research done by both Chinese and foreign scholars in recent years, and the cooperative analysis and clinical experiments done by hospitals, colleges, and pharmaceutical manufacturers, its extensive efficacy has finally been discovered. It is a hemocatheresis, detoxicant, diuretic, liver protector, intestine regulator, cardiotonic, blood pressure adjustor, a cold tonic, antitussive and expectorant, a tranquilliser and anti-tumour drug.\n \nImportant components of Ganoderma: \n\nOrganic Germanium (Ge): Can increase the oxygen absorbed by the blood up to 1.5 times: can promote metabolism: prevent tissue degeneration. According to the research of Dr Kazuhiko Asai, Ganoderma contains 800 - 2000 p.p.m. of germanium. This is 4-6 times more than ginseng.\nPolysaccharides: These can improve the body's immune system, eliminate viruses. Japanese pharmaceutical companies have refined it to medical quality and it has been approved by the Koseisho Health Department in Japan for insurance medicine. Its bitter taste. It is under constant study by the Japanese medical and pharmaceutical fields. The efficacy is a result of the interrelation of germanium and polysaccharides. Some plants may contain one or the other, but Ganoderma is much more effective. The combination of components is different from other plants and all of the components must be preserved to insure efficiency.\n \nMedical Principles of Ganoderma: \n\nAccording to Dr Shigeru Yuji's clinical experiments, the reason Ganoderma is effective is because of its basic functions.\n\nLowers cholesterol in the blood and the amount of free fat.\nReduces blood sugar level; to restore pancreas functions.\nLowers blood lipids and stabilizes red cell membrane.\nDue to Ganoderma containing Adenosine, it can lower platelet angulation, and lyses thrombi and prevent thrombogenesis.\nImproves the function of the cortex of the adrenal glands to maintain endocrine balance.\nElevates the natural healing ability of the body, allows the body to establish a strong immune system.\nPrevents tissue cell degeneration.\nPrevents senility, maintaining a youthful constitution.\nLowers the side effects of antihypertensive drugs.\nPrevents organ degeneration.\nPrevents allergy caused by antigens, because it inhibits the histamine releasing mast cell.\nPrevents and treats cancer and inhibits cancer cell metastasis.\nNormalizes to prevent tissue degeneration.\nPrevents sudden death of cancer patients caused by embolism.\nInhibits thrombogenesis and lyses thrombi on the wall of surrounding tissues and removes blockade of cancer medication, increases these drugs' effectiveness.\nRelieves pain caused by cancer.\n\nGanoderma can change an imbalanced body to a healthy one. There is no difference among human races, ancient or modern people. Ganoderma has an effect on all. The same people all over the world will obtain the same results. \n\nIf the patient's constitution conforms to Ganoderma, it is as if a patient drug is achieving its highest effects. In fact, we have not found any person who obtained negative effects or inefficient results.\n\nMore Info: healthandenergy.dxnnet.com\nEmail:itziarmlm@gmail.com\nItziar Irazusta", "title": "The Elixir of Eternal Youth", "publishedDate": "2013-06-12T16:01:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "23P5vNxFduM", "description": "Sigo mostrando a un \"viejo\" conocido de mi canal este yamadori de taxodium distichum.", "title": "Taxodium Distichum primavera 2014.", "publishedDate": "2014-06-09T07:00:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "23PFEUi1fdA", "description": "the Chef players show their \"other\" talents.", "title": "Bernard Pollard pops it", "publishedDate": "2007-08-30T04:48:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "23PYXlhoIeg", "description": "Circuito Integrado 7400..", "title": "Circuito Nand Video 4", "publishedDate": "2013-02-17T04:58:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "23Pehxkr2go", "description": "A group of centenarians living in a remote village in Kashmir are defying Pakistan's reputation as one of the worst countries in the world to live as an old person, putting their longevity down to their simple mountain lifestyle.

Please also leave a star rating!\n\nThere are a number of films here on the packaging industry.

That is not to say that the other countries are forgotten, they are not, but obviously there is less going on.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "Obama New 2015 Infiniti G Convertible 2015 New York Auto Show", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T18:10:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "23dBciBN-J4", "description": "Money And The Scuma / Blunts And Liquor VLS\nLabel: Foe LB.

Visit us at http://threeringbindersbenefits.com\n\nYou would think that deciding the best binder would be a pretty simple, straightforward decision. How can choosing something as simple as a folder with 3-rings in it be so complicated?\n\nThe fact is binders are constructed from a variety of materials. Each of these materials are suitable for a particular need. If your binder will be on the shelf in your office most of the time, a vinyl cover that's heat sealed around some cardboard should do the job. Visit us at http://threeringbindersbenefits.com\n\nHowever, if you're going to be using your binder on-the-go and throwing it around a lot, a vinyl three-ring binder won't hold up too well. That's when a poly, or plastic binders comes in handy.\n\nThese binders have the same durable metal rings as any other. Their covers though are made from a durable plastic material that's really difficult to tear. They're also resistant to heat and stains. Most of all, they're made to be thrown around a lot. Visit us at http://threeringbindersbenefits.com\n\nHow poly three-ring binders are constructed\nPoly,  basically consist of a piece of plastic that's scored in two places and wrapped around the metal rings. Scoring essentially allows the material to be bent so it can be fused with the metal rings.\n\nPlastic used for covers comes in variety of thickness ranging from 0.023 to 0.075 inches. You should carefully think about what you will be using the binder for in order to choose the right thickness. The thicker the poly material, the more durable it will be.\nPoly binders also come in a variety of finishes, with the two most common being crushed grain finish and matte. Crushed grain is characterized by small lines going through the finish that give the binder a rippled look. Matte on the other hand has a smooth, glossy finish.\n\nThese binders come also in a wide variety of colors, and can be customized with your company or organization's logo. They can be customized for a wide variety of needs, including distribution manuals, school/course manuals, sales catalogs and much more.

Many were badly burnt and the death toll was likely to rise. \n\nCharity Enang was inside a bus waiting to pull out of its bay when the explosion happened. \"All we heard was \"boom\" and I saw people's flesh flying out of the window of the bus,\" she said. \n\n\"I couldn't stand and I fell, but one man carried me out of the bus and took me to an ambulance.\" Another survivor, Chima Okere, a businessman, described hearing the explosions as he left the bus station. \"I saw so many people dead, some with their limbs dismembered from their bodies,\" he said. \"I was lucky, I do not know how I survived.\" \n\nIt was only the second major attack on Abuja blamed on Boko Haram, a fundamentalist militia growing in strength that is fighting for strict Islamic law to be introduced across Nigeria's north. \n\nIts usual targets are police stations, bars, schools, churches or public places in the majority-Muslim north, where the extremists aim to kill Christians or state security agents. Abuja is instead in the centre of Nigeria, away from Boko Haram's territory. \n\nIn 2011, its agents rammed a 4x4 laden with explosives into the United Nations headquarters in the capital, killing 21 people and wounding more than 60. \n\nThat the group's terror cells could again strike close to the heart of the country has created deep anger in Abuja, with many witnesses to yesterday's bombing blaming the government for failing to keep them safe. \n\nGoodluck Jonathan, Nigeria's president, declared a state of emergency in his nation's northern states last year, but security forces have failed to win the upper hand in the ongoing fighting there. \n\nMore than 1,500 people had already died in attacks attributed to Boko Haram in Nigeria this year, before yesterday's bombing. \n\nVisiting the scene, Mr Jonathan promised that his administration was doing all it could to contain the fundamentalists. \n\n\"The issue of Boko Haram is quite an ugly history within this period of our own development,\" he told reporters at the bus station. \n\n\"Government is doing everything to make sure that we move our country forward. But the issue of Boko Haram is temporary. Surely, we will get over it.\"\n\nGet the latest headlines http://www.telegraph.co.uk/\n\nSubscribe to The Telegraph http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=telegraphtv\n\nLike us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/telegraph.co.uk\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/telegraph\nFollow us on Google+ https://plus.google.com/102891355072777008500/\n\nTelegraph.co.uk and YouTube.com/TelegraphTV are websites of The Daily Telegraph, the UK's best-selling quality daily newspaper providing news and analysis on UK and world events, business, sport, lifestyle and culture.", "title": "Nigeria bomb blast in Abuja kills 71", "publishedDate": "2014-04-14T17:30:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "23mKpwrUvEM", "description": "", "title": "WESTERN MINDANAO STATE UNIVERSITY HYMN", "publishedDate": "2012-07-24T12:18:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "23mXtL-IBfw", "description": "Ice JJ Fish Black History Legend\nCheck me out at\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MikeRobBYOBEnt\nhttps://twitter.com/MikeRobBYOB", "title": "@MikeRobBYOB Ice JJ Fish Cartoon @IceJJFish", "publishedDate": "2014-02-26T05:13:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "23maTAEuS28", "description": "cactus cultivado en un bloque de piedra caliza", "title": "cactus   mammilaria candida", "publishedDate": "2009-02-12T21:06:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "23mbkFYH-RU", "description": "When hunger kicks in...spiders are driven to kill.\nI also like to dedicate this video to Liana for her hate of my insects and arachnids.", "title": "Grass Spider Grapples Katydid Pt 1", "publishedDate": "2011-10-15T01:01:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "23n2friXKXs", "description": "", "title": "SOUL-DIVISION pres.

Public insurance adjusting is an exciting field requiring licensing by the state's department of insurance. Once licensed, you have several options including looking for public adjuster jobs at large agencies or working for yourself.\n\nWhere are public adjuster jobs located? As with any field, public adjuster jobs are available across the United States. Again, you must be licensed by the state in which you plan on working before you'll be considered for employment.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the claims adjusting occupation is expected to grow just 3 percent from 2010 to 2020. The BLS predicts stronger growth for public adjusters focused on property and casualty claims if the trend of increased natural disasters continues. It also predicts stronger growth for those specializing in settling health insurance claims. Auto damage appraisers are expected to see negative job growth as cars continue to become safer. \n\nThe BLS suggests that public adjuster jobs will be more plentiful in areas prone to natural disasters such as the Gulf Coast (hurricanes) and the West Coast (wildfires). In all, the BLS expects projected employment for claims adjusters, examiners, and investigators to reach 288,400 by 2020. The number of public adjuster jobs is not separately tracked by the BLS.   \n\n~ Stephen Hadhazi, Public Adjuster", "title": "Public Adjuster Jobs", "publishedDate": "2012-10-05T01:45:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "23nCF-lr2yk", "description": "Dutch band local disturbance\nfrom P.E.A.C.E compilation", "title": "local disturbance - no usa", "publishedDate": "2009-05-27T20:21:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "23nj6BSlmqE", "description": "medo desses relampagos bia escandaloza xD\n\nAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!\n\nUHauhsuHAUSAushuaHSUAhsuaHSUHAushuaSH", "title": "hda e bia temporal", "publishedDate": "2011-03-21T17:01:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "23o1aW-Es-s", "description": "", "title": "Breast Self Examination by Dr. Azlina", "publishedDate": "2012-10-04T11:56:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "23o4w9Os-Fc", "description": "...", "title": "attack of the pondweed", "publishedDate": "2007-04-30T01:50:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "23on25L6Agk", "description": "The University of Kansas Hospital is the first facility in Kansas, and the region, to implant the Nanostim leadless pacemaker, the world's first retrievable, non-surgical pacing technology, as part of the LEADLESS II Clinical Trial. Developed for patients with bradycardia, a heart rate that is too slow, the device is placed directly in the patient's heart without the visible lump, scar and insulated wires (called leads) required for conventional pacemakers. The hospital is one of only 50 in the United States and Canada offering the new device.\n\nThe leadless pacemaker is one tenth the size of a conventional pacemaker and the least invasive pacing technology available today. Implanted through a vein in the leg with a steerable catheter, the device is screwed directly to the inside of the heart. The non-surgical procedure takes only 10-15 minutes, as opposed to about an hour, and no surgery means less chance of infection and much quicker recovery time. \n\n\"This is definitely the way of the future,\" said Dr. Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy, the electrophysiologist at The University of Kansas Hospital who implanted the first device. \"While pacemakers have saved countless thousands of lives over the past 7 decades since the first devices were implanted, one of the major drawbacks has been complications related to the pacing lead which runs from the battery implanted in the chest and delivers the electrical impulse to the heart. This new device is so small and by attaching it directly to the inside of the heart, all the problems related to the old-fashioned pacemaker lead are eliminated. This is a big step forward in patient treatment and a milestone for cardiac rhythm management in the United States,\" said Lakkireddy.", "title": "KU Hospital Implants Region's First Leadless Pacemaker", "publishedDate": "2014-07-01T16:14:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "23ooJYYtolc", "description": "Pouso em Parna\u00edba-PI, ATR 72-500 Azul/Trip", "title": "Pouso ATR Azul/TRIP em Parna\u00edba", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T00:45:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "23opLm7Qr1M", "description": "Darkstar Diving Trip 2005\nJeff scootering at 130 metres on the RMS Transylvania", "title": "Jeff Cornish Underwater Scootering Master Class", "publishedDate": "2007-04-13T15:25:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "23orVTb_YrM", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "Cotinus coggygria 'Golden Spirit'", "publishedDate": "2013-06-19T17:51:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "23p2lLbW-O4", "description": "ESDR SDN BHD", "title": "Xavier Meringai - Anang Dulu Ninggal (Teaser-2013)", "publishedDate": "2013-03-17T14:50:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "23p73Xb5uMY", "description": "Nimco Dagan iyo Kabankii Xudheedi (Amazing Voice)", "title": "Nimco Dagan iyo Kabankii Xudheedi (Amazing Voice)", "publishedDate": "2012-10-18T00:27:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "23pH5sylZQE", "description": "", "title": "wk\u0142ucie do\u017cylne.mp4", "publishedDate": "2010-04-20T18:28:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "23q5RRVMIEE", "description": "It's just epic", "title": "Epic harrier take off", "publishedDate": "2012-12-26T18:28:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "23q9P91W9jg", "description": "Have you ever wondered what those colorful fleshy things around a turkey's beak are?

After all, you have to balance the enjoyment of your life with the longevity of your piano. \n\nBut is there anything you can do other than close everything up? Sure.\n\nClose Your Piano at Night\n\nAt nighttime when the marine layer comes in, that is the worst time of day for your piano.\n\nThis shouldn't just be something you do if you live near the beach either. Generally, closing your piano at night is a great idea to prolong the life of the instrument.\n\nBuy a String Cover\n\nWith excessive humidity it might be a good idea to buy a string cover. \n\nThis is a piece of felt that will match the shape of the inside of your piano. It will cover the strings and protect them from humidity without affecting the sound too much.\n\nPut a Cover over the Entire Piano\n\nIf you want to protect the piano even more, you can close the entire piano and put a cover over it to prolong the life of the instrument.\n\nBut if you want the enjoyment of having your piano open a good deal of the time and still protecting it, there is one thing that might be the right solution for you.\n\nInstall a Dampp Chaser System\n\nThis is a very interesting way to prolong the life of your piano and still be able to enjoy it's beauty without having to close it or cover it.\n\nThis technology puts heating rods beneath the piano with a humidistat. Whenever the humidity gets above a certain level, the heating rods will become hot.\n\nThis will help to keep your soundboard stable and will make tuning more stable over time. \n\nBottom line, just make sure that no matter what you do to prolong the life your piano, you are able to get the enjoyment out of it that you want.", "title": "Helping Your Piano Last Longer - Pianos and Humidity", "publishedDate": "2012-04-04T21:31:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "23rmHpgDI94", "description": "iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/acoustic-ep/id847482801\nSpotify: http://open.spotify.com/album/33oxbqzo7poSO2IbSMqrPS\nMerch: http://www.shopbenchmark.com/pvris\n\nProduced & Mixed by Blake Harnage\nMastered by Jeff Juliano", "title": "PVRIS: Waking Up ACOUSTIC [OFFICIAL AUDIO]", "publishedDate": "2014-03-27T23:38:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "23s8TaffF_k", "description": "Training for Trusteeship 2011\nYouth Activation: Duties Toward Our Common Heritage\nSEP. 04 - 12, 2011 | KEGALLE, SRI LANKA\n\nVideo Interviews courtesy by Nasif Akther Khondker", "title": "Training For Trusteeship 2011 - Damithri Welikala", "publishedDate": "2011-09-15T14:42:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "23s9jUD4ZVI", "description": "Woodpeckers new Coping Sled is simply the best tool for Woodworkers to use when making rail & style doors, Tenons, Lap joints and most other end grain cuts.", "title": "Woodpeckers Coping Sled", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01T18:46:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "23sVnt8wG9c", "description": "Laying Sod in Your Backyard -- Andy Bell of Handyman Matters discusses how to lay sod.

High lead logging is a method of getting felled trees out of the tangle of a cut block. A 'spar tree' (a tall, strong tree from which all limbs are chopped) is rigged with blocks and cables. The cables are connected to an engine, steam- or diesel-driven. From the cables hang sixteen-foot choker cables, which the chokerman hooks around the logs. The whistle punk signals the donkey-puncher, who throws the engine into gear. The cable lifts the choked logs off the ground and hauls them in to the 'cold deck' at the base of the spar tree. The donkey engine sounds here are again drawn from Bob Swanson's archives.\nThis CD features the collecting work of Phil Thomas, a folklorist deeply attached to the historical and cultural roots of his native province. \nWhat Thomas showed in his collection was that the history of folk song in this most westernmost province was a history of struggle: the struggle to harvest and mine the natural resources (fish, timber, coal and metals), the struggle between the early capitalists and their work forces, and the struggle with the landform itself, allowing such easy access from the south and resisting it from the east. The songs in his collection are in the main from logging camps, from fishermen and from the constantly roaming hard rock miners, men who until just yesterday formed the overwhelming majority of the male working population. To these categories might be added songs of transportation--of railways, tugboats and wagon roads--songs of the armed forces (mostly rude squibs about military conditions) and songs made by Wobblies (the BC name for the Industrial Workers of the World, a union/party made by and for those who did not fit the polite labour unionism of the time). The songs he collected are overwhelmingly male-made and -sung. If there was ever a body of material made by women of their equally hard but much more lonely work, Thomas never found it.", "title": "The Greenhorn Song [Pollard]", "publishedDate": "2012-03-15T22:22:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "243leWRone4", "description": "short video of a female eating a snail just after she laid eggs.", "title": "Uroplatus sikorae feeding on snail", "publishedDate": "2012-03-11T13:42:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "243w3pGPEVc", "description": "Photographed at Grand Forks, North Dakota (19 July 2010).", "title": "Crambid Moth (Crambidae: Pediasia trisecta?) on Wall", "publishedDate": "2011-07-21T20:49:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "2440GUo4nwc", "description": "View from my port this morning.", "title": "My porthole", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T13:37:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "24418V6UxRs", "description": "Cabinet making is an exciting and rewarding class.

They lay down strands of silk as they move over branches and travel along them like tightrope walkers. However, it has been shown that a trail pheromone secreted from the ventral surface of the posterior tip of the abdomen rather than the silk guides and stimulates trail following. \n\nThe caterpillar are social and travel and feed en masse. The caterpillars live in deciduous trees, which they strip of leaves after emerging from their eggs. The moths favor oak, sweetgum and tupelo, aspen trees, and sugar maple for oviposition but the larvae can be found feeding on many other species of woody trees or shrubs when they disperse from ovipositional trees during outbreaks. The females lay eggs in masses of up to 300, which are stuck to twigs and covered with a gluey cement called spumaline which prevents them from desiccating or freezing over the winter. The eggs hatch the following winter.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Bloch -- Madame Irene (Pani Irena) Chanson, Parlophon c. 1929 (UK)\n\nNOTE: Aleksander Werty\u0144ski (Alexandre Vertinsky) was the legendary Russian romance interpreter and poet, who gained international recognition after 1919,  when he left Soviet Russia after the Bolshevic revolution of October 1917 and settled first in Poland, then in Paris. That handsome, elegant, cold and refined morphinist with dreamy, affectionate tenor (who, moreover, proved later to be a Soviet agent) shortly became the most adored bard of \"white\" Russian emigree circles in Western Europe and in America. His nostalgic, sophisticated poetical chant reminded them of the lost Atlantis of their pre-revolutionary life in the Tzarist Empire.  In 1920s, Werty\u0144ski gave a lot of performances in Poland, and recorded for Syrena-Electro most of his best-known songs. For the Werty\u0144ski-series, the company reserved the burgundy color of their otherwise black & gold labels, and maestro Jerzy Petersburski in person accompanied the Russian mega-star on the piano.  \n      One of fruits of Werty\u0144ski's stay in Poland has become one of his most beautiful songs \"Madame Irene\" (Pani Irena). It was adressed to a mysterious Polish beauty, whose ID remains to this day controversial for Werty\u0144ski's biographers. Werty\u0144ski recorded it in c. 1929 for the Odeon/Parlophone company in London, with piano-accompaniment by A. Bloch. Some time  later, he made its another rendition for Syrena-Electro in Warsaw with Jerzy Petersburski's accompaniment (Here, presented in the first version). \n       I dared to present in the info my own and  very imperefect English translation of Wertynski's lovely Russian lyrics -- only to let you feel the artistic class of the text , which creates - together with the restless, curving line of the melody - a true gem of Russian chanson of the 1920s. I also made  a small investigation, on who in fact Mrs. Irene was? The answer is left with you -- after you'll get acquainted with my selection of the photos of several most beautiful Polish women of the 1920s. Each of them is the possible participant in that love affair, immortalised in Werty\u0144ski's beautifl song. \n\nMadame Irene (Pani Irena)\nWords & music by Aleksander Werty\u0144ski\n\nI'm extremely afraid of this golden captivity\nOf Your copper snake hair\nI'm in love with Your subtle name \" Irene \"\nAnd in traces of your tears .\n\nI'm in love with your proud Polish hands ,\nIn your blue blood of kings,\nIn this pale face -- until my extasy, until my pain\nBurns this song to the ash. \n\nWho can forget those childish shoulders\nThis bitter, tearful mouth\nAnd accent of your exquisite Polish speech\nAnd your weary eyelashes ?\n\nA winged eyebrows ? A forehead of Beatrice ?\nAnd the spring freshness when you turn your face? ..\nOh, how hard it is to love in this world of decency ,\nOh, how it hurts to love without end!\n\nAnd to faint, ant to suffer, and not dare to get involved ,\nAnd to squeeze the heart in your grasp ,\nThen carefully withdraw , and abandon forever\nAnd smile in anguish again.\n\nFirst I can't, I don't want to, and finally - I don' wish it!\nYety, welcoming that captivity with joy\nAnd my hart to you, from the scene , like a ball I'm tossing .\nWell , catch it, Princess Irene !", "title": "Russian romance: Aleksander Werty\u0144ski - Pani Irena (Madame Irene), 1929", "publishedDate": "2014-04-28T19:46:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "24ZJcvyLGJA", "description": "Jommer noh Hus oder solle mer blieve\nIs et he sch\u00f6ner oder doheim\nSibbe Daach lang sull d\u00b4r Minsch fiere\nH\u00e4tt d\u00b4r D\u00fcvel schon immer jesaat\n\nJommer noh Hus oder solle mer blieve\nD\u00b4r leeve JOTT h\u00e4tt uns he jeparkt\nN\u00e4 wie jot dat mer all do sin\nMer blieve he bis zum j\u00fcngste Daach\n\nNa Na Na nananana Na Na Na nananana\n\nIs et nit sch\u00f6n, is et nit herrlich\nJo su mu\u00df et im Himmel sinn\nUn bis de einmol im Himmel gew\u00e4se\nWillste immer widderdo hin\n\nBliev blo\u00df drin, drusse biste verloore\nMach de D\u00fc\u00fcr zo, loos uns nit aleen\nEjne krijje mer noch  jot  un dann jommer,\njommer lang / Pause/ lang noch nit Heim\n\nJommer noh Hus oder solle mer blieve\nIs et he sch\u00f6ner oder doheim\nSibbe Daach lang sull d\u00b4r Minsch fiere\nH\u00e4tt d\u00b4r D\u00fcvel schon immer jesaat\n\nJommer noh Hus oder solle mer blieve\nD\u00b4r leeve JOTT h\u00e4tt uns he jeparkt\nN\u00e4 wie jot dat mer all do sinn\nMer blieve he bis zum j\u00fcngste Daach\n\nNa Na Na nananana Na Na Na nananana\n\nIs et nit sch\u00f6n he - is et nit herrlich\nIs et noch dunkel - oder is et alt hell\nIs et schon morje - oder hammer noch jestern\nDie Zig verjeijt leider immer zo schnell\nSimmer noch frisch - oder m\u00fcsse mer sp\u00f6le\nIs im Spark\u00e4ssje noch j\u00e4t drin\nSchloofe k\u00fcnne mer noch wenn mer alt duut sin\nHe simmer jeboore - he jeh\u00fcre mer hin\n\nJommer noh Hus oder solle mer blieve\nIs et he sch\u00f6ner oder doheim\nSibbe Daach lang sull d\u00b4r Minsch fiere\nH\u00e4tt d\u00b4r D\u00fcvel schon immer jesaat\n\nJommer noh Hus oder solle mer blieve\nD\u00b4r leeve JOTT h\u00e4tt uns he jeparkt\nN\u00e4 wie jot dat mer all do sinn\nMer blieve he bis zum j\u00fcngste Daach\n\nNa Na Na nananana Na Na Na nananana\nNa Na Na nananana Na Na Na nananana\nNa Na Na nananana Na Na Na nananana\n\nFr\u00fchling, Sommer Herbst und Winter\nOstern, Pingsten, hillije Naach\nWulle mer - sulle mer jon oder blieve\nJedes mol die selve Froch\n\nJommer noh Hus oder solle mer blieve\nIs et he sch\u00f6ner oder doheim\nSibbe Daach lang sull d\u00b4r Minsch fiere\nH\u00e4tt d\u00b4r D\u00fcvel schon immer jesaat\n\nJommer noh Hus oder solle mer blieve\nD\u00b4r leeve JOTT h\u00e4tt uns he jeparkt\nN\u00e4 wie jot dat mer all do sinn\nMer blieve he bis zum j\u00fcngste Daach\n\nNa Na Na nananana Na Na Na nananana\n\nJommer noh Hus oder solle mer blieve\nD\u00b4r leeve JOTT h\u00e4tt uns he jeparkt\nN\u00e4 wie jot dat mer all do sinn\nMer blieve he bis zu j\u00fcngste Daach", "title": "Bl\u00e4ck F\u00f6\u00f6ss - Jommer noh Hus oder solle mer blieve", "publishedDate": "2010-01-11T16:23:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "24ZW7fQPFWM", "description": "Secondary School Girls displays moves to go weired, Should this be encouraged in schools?", "title": "Secondary School Girls Learnt Bad Habits", "publishedDate": "2013-12-02T17:14:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "24_4A0YlrlA", "description": "", "title": "Candida Arroyo Primipara", "publishedDate": "2012-05-12T16:02:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "24_7ZOTomqk", "description": "", "title": "Bilirubin -  a monk's room", "publishedDate": "2012-05-28T03:54:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "24_ATAfj8ws", "description": "This little adult female Gould's Wattled Bat was rescued during 2007 from a crane at Outer Harbour.

It connects the banks of the river at Kerkstraat (Church Street), between Keizersgracht (Emperors' Canal) and Prinsengracht (Princes' Canal).\n\nThe central section of the Magere Brug is a bascule bridge made of white-painted wood. The present bridge was built in 1934. The first bridge at this site was built in 1691 as Kerkstraatbrug and had 13 arches. Because this bridge was very narrow, the locals called it magere brug, which literally means \"skinny bridge\". In 1871 the state of the bridge was so bad that it was demolished and replaced by a nine-arched wooden bridge. Fifty years later this bridge also needed to be replaced. Architect Piet Kramer made several designs for a steel and stone bridge, but the city decided to replace it with a new bridge that looked the same as the previous, only slightly bigger. In 1934 the bridge was demolished and replaced. The last major renovation was in 1969. Until 1994 the bridge was opened by hand, but now is opened automatically.\n\nUse of the bridge has been limited to pedestrians and cyclists since 2003. It is however opened many times a day in order to let through river traffic. The boats used for sightseeing tours are low enough to pass underneath the bridge when closed. The bridge is decorated with 1200 light bulbs that are illuminated in the evening.\n\nA story told to tourists about the origins of the 1691 version of the bridge is that it was built by two wealthy sisters who lived on opposite sides of the Amstel river and wanted to be able to visit one another every day (and were presumably too busy, or not in good enough health, to go the long way round via another bridge, of which there must surely have been at least one). In one variant of the story the sisters, although wealthy, were not quite wealthy enough to afford a bridge of adequate width for general use and so built a very narrow bridge, hence its name. In another variant of the story the sisters' last name was Mager, hence the bridge's name (rather than from its narrowness).\n\nThe bridge can be seen in a number of films, such as the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever from 1971", "title": "magere brug, Skinny Bridge Amsterdam", "publishedDate": "2010-03-05T11:51:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "24fBvMj_gmc", "description": "", "title": "Oryza Basmatireis mit Limette & Ingwer", "publishedDate": "2008-09-18T08:33:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "24fDrNfTSws", "description": "Musica Lucullus Federico Bogna\nVery wonderful metephisic pictures", "title": "Lucullus Believer wmn", "publishedDate": "2013-11-05T20:44:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "24flRjwjBWM", "description": "http://instatour.propertypanorama.com/instaview/mfr/W7524655 is the place to go if you are seeking homes for sale near NEW PORT RICHEY Florida.

Nagin in this Howcast video.\n\n\nYeast infections, unfortunately, are very common in breastfeeding as well. With a yeast infection, otherwise known as thrush, you can have either a nipple thrush or a deep breast thrush. With a nipple thrush the nipple will sometimes look very red, very pink, almost shiny. Sometimes it can even be white. \n\nBut, in all cases there is severe pain. The typical responses of moms that you ask, without putting words into your mouth tell me what it feels like, they will say burning, feels like daggers are behind my nipple, feels like needles are jabbing into me. All of those are key signs that it is a thrush. And that lasts all day long. It doesn't matter if the baby's on, or off, or you're sleeping, or you're awake. It lasts all day long. It's not an isolated incident.\n\nIn cases like this there are a few different options. One is if it's a nipple thrush we need to get a prescription for Nystatin cream. Usually, even if the baby's showing no signs of thrush, we still have to treat both mom and baby. So they would need an oral suspension for their mouth which the pediatrician would recommend. It's Nystatin oral suspension.\n\nA lot of times the mom will have it, baby won't. The baby might, the mom might not. If the baby does present with anything we're looking at white patches in their mouth. They might have an extensive diaper rash. It's pretty obvious.\n\nFor a deep breast thrush which, again, has become a systemic infection at that point, we really have to think about talking to your doctor about putting you on Diflucan. That does not mean one pill, because that's for a vaginal yeast infection. Talk to your lactation consultant, and she will discuss with you dosage. But, it is very important, because this is a systemic infection, to not just have a one or three day pill. \n\nThe other option, although messy, but definitely works, is gentian violet which you can get at the health food store. It is purple. It will stain your baby's mouth. It will stain your clothes. It will stain your nipples. It eventually does go away. But, it does work. It is the most natural remedy of all. So, that is another option.\n\nIn addition to the fact that during this time anything that touched the baby's mouth really should be sterilized or thrown away, especially if they're bottle nipples or pacifiers or anything like that. With your clothes an ideal thing to do would be to put a cup of vinegar into the rinse cycle of your wash and really kill all of the yeast. \n\nIt takes a while to get rid of a yeast infection. The best things that we can do naturally are also diet related. We have to watch the sugars in our diet so it doesn't feed the yeast. So, as much as it kills us to break away from the bread and the fruit any of the sweets, during this time period, so nothing is feeding this yeast, we might have to go on a little bit of a diet. But, eventually, when it goes away you can have all that back.", "title": "How to Treat a Yeast Infection | Breastfeeding", "publishedDate": "2013-06-27T15:55:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "24q-TLZeBjQ", "description": "http://www.citytowninfo.com/employment/carpenters Interested in becoming a carpenter?

The book says that Gandhi slept and bathed with young girls, which is not easily believable by many. As per the book, much of such material about Gandhi was known during his lifetime, but was distorted or suppressed after his death during the process of elevating Gandhi into the 'Father of the Nation'.\n\n2. Gandhi used to beat his wife up routinely. He had also denied sex to her for decades\n\n3. Gandhi was having sex when his father lay breathing his last upstairs. He was an adulterer and had a spiritual marriage with two British women who were in the Ashram.\n\n4. Gandhi slept naked with his niece (and 12 year old girls) and other women to prove that he could control his manliness\n\n5. Gandhi would do enemas twice a day and if he liked you allowed you to enter the piece up his rectum\n\n6. Gandhi's son left him and converted to Islam. Gandhi condones Zulu massacres and defends the British.\n\n7. Which war did Mohandas Gandhi support? All of them. There wasn't a war that the prophet of Non-Violence did not support. He was Sergeant Major in the British Army and won a medal for his war duties\n\n8. Gandhi used to write letters to his friend Hitler and supported him.\n\n9. Gandhi's horrific advice to Jews\u2014Commit mass suicide. \"We have no doubt about your bravery or devotion to your fatherland, nor do we believe that you are the monster described by your opponents.\" Gandhi to Hitler...\n\n10.

Trained in a military school, he was quickly promoted to commander of the French army in 1796, in which capacity he succeeded in forcing Austria and it allies to make peace. Two years later, Napoleon conquered the section of Egypt which was under Ottoman rule in an effort to disrupt British trade routes with India. The British retaliated by destroying his fleet at the Battle of the Nile.\n\nIn 1799, Napoleon was elected first consul of France to help bring order to the Parisian government which was in turmoil following Austria and Russia's alliance with Britain. Three years later Napoleon was made consul for life, and in 1804 he was made emperor of France. His many accomplishments as emperor included creating the Bank of France, implementing law reform with the code Napoleon, centralizing the French government and resinstating Roman Catholicism as the state religion.\n\nHis military career was at its peak in 1800 where he defeated the Austrians at Marengo before negotiating a general European peace treaty which implemented French power on the continent. Britain renewed its war on France in 1803 with backing from its new allies Austria and Russia. While British forces defeated the French at Trafalgar, Napoleon took aim at the Austrian and Russian forces and defeated them at Austerlitz, claiming new territory for the French as he went, most notably the annexation of Prussian lands which for all intents and purposes gave him control over most of Europe. Holland and Westphalia were created under the leadership of Napoleon's relatives and loyalists while the Holy Roman Empire was obliterated.\n\nThe Peninsular War in 1808 was the beginning of the end of Napoleon's power. Continuous defeats and heavy losses brought French military resources to its knees. When Napoleon attempted to invade Russia in 1812 it cost him another defeat, crippling the already weakened French army, and the Allies began to get the upper hand. In March 1814, Paris lost to the Allies, and Napoleon went into exile on the Mediterranean Island of Elba. A year later, Napoleon escaped his exile in a grand plan to storm the French capital and reclaim his throne. In what was later known as the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon's return to glory fell short, and he was imprisoned by the British and sent to the far off Atlantic island of St. Helena, where he died on May 5, 1821 at the age of 51.\n\n*Napoleon did marry briefly to Josephine de Beauharnais, but their inability to produce children caused Napoleon to annul the marriage and take the daughter of an Austrian emperor, Marie louise, for a bride. Their son, Napoleon, was born a year later, though his life ended 21 years later when he contracted tuberculosis. Napoleon was prolific with various mistresses, however, and his many illegitimate children may never all be accounted for, though Napoleon did acknowledge a number of them.\n\n*The \"death mask\" most popularly displayed at being that of Napoleon, even at his tomb in France, is doubtful in its authenticity for a number of reasons: the size and length of the head belongs to a tall man. It is well documented that Napoleon was quite short in stature; less than 5 foot 5 inches tall. The mask betrays the presence of a full set of teeth, while Napoleon in his 50's had next to no teeth left in his mouth at the time of his death. The popular death mask of Napoleon is also quite young-looking and smooth-faced in contrast to what one would expect from the appearance of a man in middle age.

Two ships were approved, to compete with the Independence variant design offered by General Dynamics and Austal for a construction contract of up to 55 vessels.\n\nAs of 2013, two ships are active and a third is under construction. Despite initial plans to only accept one of the Freedom and Independence variants, the USN has requested that Congress order ten ships of each variant.\nPlanning and construction[edit]\n\nPlanning for a class of small, multipurpose warships to operate in the littoral zone began in the early 2000s. The construction contract was awarded to Lockheed Martins LCS team (Lockheed Martin, Gibbs  Cox, Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards) in May 2004 for two vessels. These would then be compared to two ships built by Austal USA to determine which design would be taken up by the Navy for a production run of up to 55 ships.\n\nOn 15 April 2003, the Lockheed Martin LCS team unveiled their Sea Blade concept based on the hull form of the motor yacht Destriero.[11][12]\n\nThe keel of the lead ship USS Freedom was laid down in June 2005, by Marinette Marine in Marinette, Wisconsin.[13] She was christened in September 2006,[14][15] delivered to the Navy in September 2008, and commissioned that November.[16] During INSURV trials, 2,600 discrepancies were discovered, including 21 considered high-priority.[17] Not all of these were rectified before the ship entered service, as moving the ship away from Milwaukee before the winter freeze was considered a higher priority.[18]\n\nCost overruns during Freedoms construction combined with projected future overruns led the government to issue a Stop-work in January 2007 and ultimately led to the cancellation of construction of LCS-3 (the second Lockheed Martin ship) on April 13, 2007.[19] This ship was later re-ordered.\n\nAfter much inconsistency on how testing and orders were to proceed, in November 2010, the USN asked that Congress approve ten of both the Freedom and Independence variants.[20][21][22]\nThe ship is a semi-planing steel monohull with an aluminum superstructure. It is 377 feet (115 m) in length, displaces 2,950 metric tons, and can go faster than 45 knots (83 km/h 52 mph). The design incorporates a large reconfigurable seaframe to allow rapidly interchangeable mission modules, a flight deck with integrated helicopter launch, recovery and handling system and the capability to launch and recover boats (manned and unmanned) from both the stern and side.\n\nThe flight deck is 1.5 times the size of that of a standard surface ship, and uses a Trigon traversing system to move helicopters in and out of the hangar. The ship has two ways to launch and recover various mission packages: a stern ramp and a starboard side door near the waterline. The mission module bay has a 3-axis crane for positioning modules or cargo.[23] Problems with the ramp and boat handling equipment are the most serious problems with the Freedom class.[24]\n\nThe fore deck has a modular weapons zone which can be used for a 57 mm gun turret or missile launcher. A Rolling Airframe Missile launcher is mounted above the hangar for short-range defense against aircraft and cruise missiles, and .50-caliber gun mounts are provided topside. The Fleet-class unmanned surface vessel is designed for operations from Freedom variant ships.[25]\n\nThe core crew will be 40 sailors, usually joined by a mission package crew and an aviation detachment for a total crew of about 75. Automation allows a reduced crew, which greatly reduces operating costs, but workload can still be gruelling.[26] During testing of the class lead, two ships companies will rotate on four-month assignments.[27]\n\nFour 750-kilowatt Fincantieri Isotta-Fraschini diesel generators provide 3 megawatts of electrical power to power the ship systems.[28]\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that fuel will account for only 8 percent to 18 percent of the total life-cycle costs for Freedom.[29] Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama has called the report into question and has suggested that the Independence, built in his state, would be more fuel efficient and that less frequent refuelings would have an impact on military operations beyond the cost of fuel.[30]\n\nIn 2012, a Navy cybersecurity team found major deficiencies in Lockheeds Total Ship Computing Environment, which controls the entire ship in order to reduce crewing requirements.[31][32]\nThe United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. It is larger than the next 13 largest navies combined in terms of battle fleet tonnage, according to one estimate.[5][6]The LCS Mission\n\nThe Littoral Combat Ship", "title": "ADVANCED US Navy Freedom Class littoral combat shipLockheed Martin - Fort Worth Littoral Combat Ship", "publishedDate": "2014-03-03T10:43:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "256XjxiF2ik", "description": "Will your boyfriend willingly walk your pocket pooch around town?

Found in all temperate to tropical oceans yet rarely seen, the oarfish family contains four species in two genera. One of these, the king of herrings (Regalecus glesne), is the longest bony fish alive, at up to 17 metres (56 ft) in length. \nThe common name oarfish is presumably in reference to either their highly compressed and elongated bodies, or to the former (but now discredited) belief that the fish \"row\" themselves through the water with their pelvic fins. The family name Regalecidae is derived from the Latin regalis, meaning \"royal\". The occasional beachings of oarfish after storms, and their habit of lingering at the surface when sick or dying, make oarfish a probable source of many sea serpent tales.\nAlthough the larger species are considered game fish and are (to a minor extent) fished commercially, oarfish are rarely caught alive; their flesh is not well regarded due to its gelatinous consistency.", "title": "The World's Longest Bony Fish - King of Herrings  Oarfish", "publishedDate": "2013-03-04T22:35:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "25BviXznK2Y", "description": "fail", "title": "Stitching laceration", "publishedDate": "2009-06-21T01:40:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "25BzyERBkuY", "description": "", "title": "Delphinapterus leucas\u3000Magic ring", "publishedDate": "2014-10-17T23:19:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "25CM2GjwMOo", "description": "--------GIVEAWAY ENDS 1/20/2013--------\n*** Get Your 1 Month Free Trial Of Gamefly: http://tiny.cc/Gameflytrial ***\nBecome a fan on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EVGNentertainment\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/EVGNOfficial\nCheck out GameHaunts Warframe Giveaway - http://gamehaunt.com/warframe-beta-key-giveaway/\n\nWhats up gamers im Zach Sharpes and in this video I announce that we are giving away 3 copies of Deadlight!

Even though the longevity could have been better, especially considering the price tag, the sillage is excellent. People around will be able to smell this, as Green Irish Tweed projects very well. As it definitely is a daytime fragrance, its lack of longevity might be regarded as a strong point, as people might want to wear something different in the evenings.\n \nThe top is made out of lemon and verbena. The middle consists of iris and violet leaves. The base is a blend of sandalwood and ambergris. Green Irish Tweed is by far one of the most pleasant smells out there. In addition, it is very safe, comfy and quite similar to Cool Water. This fragrance is perfect for daily wear, either at the office, in a suit, case in which it turns out sophisticated, or in a casual setting, with jeans and T-shirt. \n\nBesides being safe, Green Irish Tweed is also fresh and fizzy, because of the lemon-verbena combo. This vibe is almost similar to Sprite. The ambergris note gives the scent an aquatic-earthy vibe that is accompanied by a subtle floral accord that can be easily missed if not paying attention. There is also some basil in this fragrance, even though it is nowhere to be seen in the note pyramid. The sandalwood at the base balances out the whole fragrance and blends it all together. http://www.fragrancetalk.com", "title": "Green Irish Tweed by Creed Cologne/Fragrance Review", "publishedDate": "2011-02-18T01:07:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "25Sh_5-UQq4", "description": "I love this old stuff", "title": "Dad's adjustable scaffolding and ladder hangers", "publishedDate": "2011-07-03T22:31:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "25SjNJA5FZU", "description": "Hey Guys i realised someone in ruse has the name exile and im getting called a fan boy and shit so im thinking about changing it to celosia arts from SoC wich is a child hood game for me so yea....oh and this is my 2in1 for whiz thnks guys :)", "title": "Whiz 9K Contest Entry | 2 In One - Exiled/Celosia Arts", "publishedDate": "2014-02-20T02:49:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "25SxPX55Gy4", "description": "refugee women  hunger strike breaking \n@ purbelitimes.com", "title": "hunger strike break", "publishedDate": "2011-11-26T11:43:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "25TQwSQySG4", "description": "Les dessous de la premi\u00e8re vid\u00e9o du Woop : LA NOTICE - BOIRE DE L'EAU\n\nRESERVE TA PLACE POUR LE SPECTACLE DU WOOP AU FEUX DE LA RAMPE\nhttp://www.billetreduc.com/117892/evt.htm\n\nFACEBOOK : http://www.facebook.com/LeWoopGang\nTWITTER : http://www.twitter.com/LeWoopGang\n\nMix & Sound Design : Antoine Caracci\nMusique : Geronimo Beats / http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwJCwcZUF3U\nR\u00e9alisation : Manou Febvret, Yvick Letexier, Hugo Dessioux\nFX : Manou Febvret et IBREC Production\n\nRemerciements : \n- IDZ Prod\n\n\n\nLE WOOP :\n- Hugo Tout Seul\n- Mister V\n- Malcolm TotheWorld\n- Hakim Jemili\n- J\u00e9r\u00e9mie dethelot\n- Youssoupha Diaby\n- Mike Kenli", "title": "BONUS #1 : LA NOTICE - BOIRE DE L'EAU", "publishedDate": "2014-03-07T17:00:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "25TXilVWQaM", "description": "", "title": "Toronto soccer referees", "publishedDate": "2010-06-06T06:01:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "25UYtaCnH1o", "description": "Follow these steps to get a reference for your UCAS application.", "title": "Requesting a reference", "publishedDate": "2014-08-29T09:39:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "25Uho_YrJF0", "description": "How and why to backwash your filters.

The movie is constructed using arc view files imported into Atlas Software developed by Alan Smith Cambridge University. The initial starting configuration shows a close fit of the two restored continental margins which are put back to their original pre-extension position, using area balancing of complete crustal sections. \nThe blue line following the Benue rift and other rifts in Africa is a plate boundary so that NW Africa is allowed to move independently from the rest of Africa.  150 The first events to affect the south Atlantic are the development of a sag basin in latest Jurassic times in Gabon and NE Brazil shown in olive-yellow, and N-S opening of the Argentinian rifts shown in light blue. 147\nThe next major event is the impingement of the Parana-Etendeka plume\n139-130.\n, the outline of onshore igneous outcrops is shown in the hachured purple area. This outline indicates there was almost as much magmatism in Africa as there was in Brazil, and there is a good match of the two volcanic envelopes across the future Atlantic Ocean.  However, most of the African volcanics are interpreted to have been eroded, and a larger proportion of volcanics was preserved on the S. American margin shown as the light purple area.132\n130-125  \nThe main south Atlantic rifting occurred in the Barremian with a pole of rotation situated in NE Brazil. The Gabon-Sergipe-Alagoas margin was a transform margin during this time and underwent approximately 200 km of left lateral shear. \n125-118\nThis was followed by E-W extension which commenced about 118 M Yr ago with a pole of rotation which jumped farther north by several hundred kilometres. The pink salt basin is shown developing at approximately 118 Ma, although some localised salt basins probably developed before this time in Angola and shallow Sergipe-Alagoas Basins. POINT TO OUTER SANTOS BASIN The outer part of the Santos Salt Basin overlaps onto the African Continent which probably indicates that this salt developed slightly later when there was more space created by spreading.\n125-115\nBy 115 Ma Africa and Brazil were widely separated with ocean spreading filled the gap shown in white between the two salt basins. This probably explains why the later salts in Gabon and Congo and Sergipe-Alagoas, are unusual Mg-K rich-salts which developed in sea water strongly affected by hydrothermal alteration of oceanic basalts. as it goes\nThe Walvis Ridge-Rio Grande Rise v shaped pattern of purple volcanics is shown developing as both Africa and South America drift northward in reference to the fixed hotspot location of Tristan de Cunha which appears as the dark red spot in the last 50  Myr of the movie. \n\nThe last part of the restoration shows the various major deltas developing as orangey-brown areas.\nClients detailed proprietory data from single basins can be integrated into this software and tailor-made movies created.  \nFor further information on the digital atlas and report which were used to create this movie, please contact Ian Davison.", "title": "South Atlantic Digital Geological Atlas - South Atlantic Opening", "publishedDate": "2012-11-27T15:25:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "25Vi7CxlV1k", "description": "Browse Our Selection Of Convex Mirrors!\nhttp://www.mirrorpros.com/convex-mirror.htm\n\nMirrorPros.com offers a basic, short video on the different types of convex security mirrors.

Philosophically Tedium were interested in breaking down social, moral and intellectual boundaries imposed on oneself by oneself or society as a whole. Emphasis was on having an experience as opposed to entertaining an audience. The pressure of an audiences expectation was used as fuel for the performance.\n------------------------------------\nIn 1998 Tedium started the fashion label TDS Clothing. They won a 1998 Melbourne Fringe Fashion award, and shortly after opened a shop in South Yarra were the band and label were based. Many popular Australian musicians, actors and artists wore TDS Clothing. The shop was closed in 2003 after the experiment had ran it\u2019s course.\n------------------------------------\nTedium Albums\n1994 - Elektronik Love Songs for the Mediocre at Heart\n1997 - Simple Life\n2001 - Nothing Final\n2013 - Keep it Kleen  - Compilation 1993 - 2001\n\nhttp://tedium.bandcamp.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TDSCLOTHING\nhttp://australiangothicindustrialmusic.com/bands/TDM-tedium.html", "title": "TEDIUM - Gunnarise", "publishedDate": "2010-05-03T13:19:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "25acqcrQ4Gw", "description": "Andrew explore different things that he didn't think that he will enjoy.

However, unlike the real clips you will be shown what the hazard is, and when the score window opens and closes using a red circle to highlight this. If you clicked before or after the appearance of the red circle in this example you would score zero.\n\nOver 600 hazard clips are available for you to test yourself in realistic examination conditions on LDC's software products for PCs. Two full tests are available online for free at our main website www.learnerdriving.com.\n\nIf you want to see a wide range of videos on learning to drive, the theory test and the driving test please look at our YouTube TV channel click LDCDrivingSchool above or the link below:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/LDCDrivingSchool\n\nToo many driving instructors focus too much attention on telling their pupils what to do and what to think! This approach only fosters dependency, doubt and blind obedience, such that once the test is passed they do all the things they were told not to do. The LDC approach is designed to foster self-reliance, confidence and responsibility resulting in safer drivers who learn to drive far more quickly.\n\nUnlike traditional instruction LDC heavily promotes student centred learning. This involves the student being encouraged to take more responsibility for their own development by using the LD System materials before and after each lesson and by using discovery learning with self determination and reflection rather than being told what to do by the instructor. In particular talk through instruction, prompted practice and long winded explanations are avoided, if at all possible - instead encouraging the student to work it out for themselves.

Mario races Sesame Street's Cookie Monster, teaches him to drive straight and tells him not to drive with a cookie! In the end, Sesame Street's Cookie Monster crashes his car into walls, crashes his car down the stairs, crashes into a tree, and smashes his car into Mario. This video is one of many of the DisneyCarToys channel Cookie Monster Topic videos. Nintendo's Mario tells Sesame Street's Cookie Monster that he is a even worse driver than Luigi! Mario must not like Luigi much.

Next time we should have Sesame Street Elmo, Ernie, Big Bird, Snuffy or Bert drive to see if they drive better. Cookie Monster really shouldn't be eating cookies while driving.

The 72-ton, 40-foot (12-meter)-long vehicles are based on the M1 Abrams with a 1,500 horsepower engine, but fitted with a 50-caliber machine gun and a front-mounted 15-foot (4.5-meter) wide plow, supported by metallic skis that glide on the dirt and armed with nearly 7,000 pounds (3,175 kilograms) of explosives.\n\nThey were called \"the answer\" to the deadliest threat facing NATO troops in this conflict. The Breachers are also equipped with M58 MICLIC Mine Clearing Line Charges: rockets carrying C-4 explosives up to 100-150 yards (meters) forward, detonating hidden bombs at a safe distance, so that troops and vehicles can pass through safely.\n\nIn the 1990s, the U.S. Army decided it could not afford to continue developing complicated, maintenance-heavy vehicles for this purpose. The Grizzly program was canceled in 2001. The prototype developed never made it to the production lines. The Marine Corps however persisted and funded its own development and testing. The main body of the final model of the ABV is built on the General Dynamics chassis that is used for the M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank. Pearson Engineering of the UK provided the specially designed plow and the other mine-clearing accessories.\n\nFollow us:\nBlogger - http://warinimages.blogspot.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/WarinImages\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/WarinImages\n\nAll of our videos are strictly for news/entertainment and reporting/educational purposes only and for sharing important information with the public.

Hunter (May 16, 1876 - January 23, 1906) was an American composer of ragtime music.\n\nCharles Hunter was born in Columbia, Tennessee, and at birth was almost totally blind. He attended the School for the Blind in Nashville, Tennessee, where he learned the piano tuner's trade. He went to work at the Jesse French Piano Company in Nashville. Absorbing the folk strains of Nashville, he published his first rag, \"Tickled to Death,\" in 1899, which became a hit. This was followed in 1900 by \"A Tennessee Tantilizer,\" and in 1901 by \"Possum and Taters,\" \"Cotton Bolls,\" and \"Queen of Love.\"\n\nIn 1902 he transferred to Jesse French's St. Louis store. \"Just Ask Me\" was published that year, and \"Why We Smile\" the next.\n\nHunter's health and career deteriorated as he partook of the St. Louis night life, and it wasn't until late in 1905 that he published his final rag, \"Back to Life,\" so named to celebrate his return to health. It was a short-lived recovery; he died of tuberculosis not long afterwards.

This allows farmers to save their seeds for a time when this commodity has a higher market value. This allows for safe storage of the cowpeas without the use of pesticides. In the video, which can be used on smart phones, we describe the steps needed for hermetically sealing cowpea seeds in a series of plastic bags. The two inner bags are for hermetic sealing and the outer third bag, which is made of woven material, is used to protect the inner bags from damage.

Is it because God enjoys censuring and condemning them? Of course not. No, it is done in order better to reveal God's patience and glory and also so that those who hear it may fear God's judgment. But now, come and listen to an astonishing conversation. Look there, the younger bishop has asked the older one a question, saying: 'Brother, hear and answer me. Once you had been bound to the yoke of obedience, why did you forsake it? Once you had chosen poverty and the religious state, why did you abandon them? Once you had entered the religious state and made yourself dead to the world, why did you seek the episcopate?' The older man answered: 'The obedience that taught me to be an inferior was a burden to me. That is why I preferred my freedom. The yoke that God says is pleasant was bitter to me.\n\nThat is why I sought and chose bodily comfort. My humility was pretended. That is why I craved honors. And, since it is better to push than to pull, I desired the episcopate accordingly.' The younger man asked again: 'Why did you not do honor to your episcopal see by giving it worldly honor? Why did you not acquire riches by means of worldly wisdom? Why did you not spend your possessions according to the demands of worldly honor? Why did you humble yourself outwardly rather than acting in accord with worldly ambition?'\n\nThe older man answered: 'The reason I did not strew worldly honors upon my see was that I was hoping myself to be honored so much the more by appearing to be humble and spiritual rather than worldly minded. Therefore, in order to be praised by worldly people, I made a show of holding everything in contempt; I appeared humble and devout in order to be held in esteem by spiritual men. The reason I did not acquire riches through worldly wisdom was in order that spiritual men might not notice it and hold me in contempt because of my secularity. The reason I was not liberal in giving gifts was that I preferred to have few rather than many companions for the sake of my own peace and quiet. I preferred having my money-chest full to handing away gifts.'", "title": "HOMELAND FBI CLANDESTINE SECURITY RAIDS ON CHRISTIAN MILITIA !!! WACO TRAGEDY !!!
