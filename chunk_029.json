The truth is, is that most cats really don't smell very much at all. I mean, they do a pretty good job bathing. However, if you don't monitor that litter box, you are going to have a smelly house or at least a smelly room and your cat might veto the box entirely if it's dirty and go to the bathroom somewhere else in the house. \n\nSo, if you're worried about cat odor, think first about the litter box itself. Make sure that you're cleaning the box at least twice a day and scooping out any solids and disposing of them outside of your home. In addition, make sure to replace the entire litter box litter itself at least every week. If you wait longer than that, you're definitely going to have smellier litter present in your home. \n\nNow, some puppy litter say that you can leave them in for up to a month and that's fine, but just keep in mind that many people with smelly litter boxes actually forget when they last replaced all of their litter. So, if you're going to go an entire month, make sure to mark it on the calendar and replace it judiciously. Other things to keep in mind are keeping the box itself clean not just the litter. \n\nSo, when you change the litter every time you do so, make sure that you wash the box out. Do this with just the mild soap and some really hot water. If you can, set it out in the sun to dry so that you can get a little bit more antibacterial effect. Do keep in mind though it's important not to use harsh chemicals in your litter box because the cat has to go to the bathroom in there and they have a really great sense of smell. If it smells funny, they might not be comfortable using it. \n\nIf you have cat odors that are in your fabrics or in your carpet, research shows that the most likely thing to help that is actually Febreze [SP] with cleanse air. So, as long as you feel comfortable having that product in your environment I certainly recommend you get some and spray the areas where your cat hangs out. Otherwise, I think if you keep your box clean, you'll find that litter box smell and cat smell overall just really aren't a problem for you. That's how you keep your house cat odor free.", "title": "How to Reduce Cat Odor & Cat Poop Odor | Cat Care", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T19:06:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "0lZDvwO_-98", "description": "Hyundai Equus (Proudia) commercial \ud604\ub300 \uc5d0\ucfe0\uc2a4 8\uae30\ud1b5 4500cc\n\nIn 1999, Hyundai Motors and Mitsubishi Motors presented their full-size sedan.

The visual image used in this virtual movie is a self portrait drawn by Keith Douglas during his prewar Oxford days he was not only a fine poet,but a talented artist as well. Douglas the son of a British army officer had studied literature at Oxford university under the ww1 poet Edmund Blunden he is deservedly remembered for his almost metaphysical style in which he often described graphicaly the horrors of war and is among my favourite poets and one I have a great feeling of affinity with. Among the ideas sustained by chivalric poetry was noblesse oblige, the belief that the upper classes had a special obligation to lead the way in warfare. That sense of obligation applied to kings as late as 1743, when George II led his troops into battle at Dettingen, though he was the last English monarch to do so. It continued to apply to titled aristocrats for two more centuries. As late as World War II, it was possible for a soldier-poet from the middle class to admire the courageous, disinterested stance of a comrade who was an aristocrat by birth. In a poem entitled Aristocrats, the British tank commander Keith Douglas recorded the death of one such man, deftly deploying some traditional chivalric metaphors: Fighting on horseback was the original marker of knightly nobility, so Douglas, with comic affection, turns his comrade into a noble centaur\u2014part horse, part man\u2014who absurdly displays his courage by smoking his pipe as shells fall nearby. When one of them strikes him, the dying man describes his mortal wound as most unfair, echoing the cherished notion that noblemen fight by fixed and generous rules, playing the game as if it were cricket or polo. Douglas recognizes the folly of such attitudes, but is man enough to admit being moved to tears by this gentle obsolescent breed of heroes. The horn he hears is the one associated with the medieval epic hero Roland, and the unicorn is a potent medieval icon. By achieving a delicate, risky balance between the motifs of chivalry and the realities of the North African tank campaign, Douglas found a way to praise the dead mans heroism and unconcern while honestly recognizing his outdated stance as a form of stupidity. Douglass own death in the Normandy invasion, at the age of twenty-four, was a great loss for poetry. Keith Douglas began to publish his verse in periodicals in the 1930s, while he was still studying at Oxford; however, the only volume to be published in his lifetime was 'Selected Poems' (1943). He was killed in Normandy. His reputation rests mainly on his war poetry, particularly that depicting the desert warfare he experienced in North Africa. The unquiet intensity of this piece is reminiscent of that found in some Elizabethan 'metaphysical' poetry. Keith Douglas was born in Kent, and educated at Oxford University under the tutorship of poet Edward Blunden, before enlisting with the British Army when World War II broke out. He is the most famous English poet of that war, although he began publishing his work at the age of 16. His verse is precise, unsentimental and at times chilling, in its treatment of desire and sexuality as well as in its pervasive obsession with death and the relation of death to writing. Douglas was killed in Normandy, having also written about his involvement in the war in North Africa, his slim but intensely powerful corpus concluded at an early age.

Almost 100% of missing hub caps are due to improper installation and whether the fault lies with you or your mechanic, we can teach you the right way to install your wheel covers and center caps! After watching our video, you won't have to keep replacing your missing hub caps and spending unnecessary money.\n\nWith this particular task, there are some tools required, one you might already have and one that our company sells to make hubcap installation simple for everyone. Depending on the type of center caps you have on your vehicle, of which there are three, you will need a lug wrench to tighten the bolts of your hubcap or you can use our hubcap tool to get the job done correctly. As shown in the video, there are three types of hubcaps: bolt on, pop on and screw on. The simplest hubcap to install is the pop on and will only require our special hubcap tool or a soft rubber mallet to tap the center caps into place. With the other two options, a lug wrench is needed to tighten the lug nuts on your wheel cover so that there is no danger of them falling off while you're driving.\n\nAlthough this is a very easy process that only takes a few minutes to learn to do properly, we still want to encourage everyone out there watching to be careful and follow all of our instructions completely to avoid any kind of injury.  It is also important to remember that it is up to you to make sure that no one uses an impact wrench to install your hub caps, ever. The reason for this is that using that tool when installing hubcaps can strip the threading on the lug nuts and will cause you to lose it the very next time you hit a little bump in the road. As always, if anyone has any questions, our staff is here to help you, just call our toll free number provided at the bottom.

We are the only agency in the area that still has an active pull box system, said Aniolek. \nThe city of Schenectady prioritizes their medical and fire calls on a alpha to echo level scale. On an apha call they respond with traffic obeying all traffic laws. On a charlie, delta or echo call they respond with lights and sirens. \nIf someone that twisted their ankle yesterday called, they would probably get an alpha response, said Fire Chief Della Rocco. \nEcho level calls are saved for cardiac arrest or a building fully involved. Chief Della Rocco said a lot of the false alarms are caused by dust or bugs or by people disabling the alarm. \nWhen we have people just pulling the alarm, we will sometimes want to go after people criminally, said Mayor Gary McCarthy. \nMcCarthy said they will also enforce fines upon chronic offenders, at least with fire alarms. \u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080", "title": "False alarms cost Schenectady big money", "publishedDate": "2013-03-18T03:30:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "0lfBo8KpsxY", "description": "Today on Epic Game Music I do an original guitar cover from the Popular Youtube show The Game Exchange.

Have you ever wondered how to lift up your cheeks as gravity works against them?  If you learn how to isolate the muscles in your face you can easily tone and firm your cheeks.  In this video Face Yoga expert, Fumiko Takatsu, shows you how to exercise, lift up and firm your cheek muscles. Hi I am Fumiko from the Face Yoga Method.  Jane from Facebook asked me how to lift up the cheeks with face yoga exercise.  This is such a great question because as you know gravity is working against us and everything is going down.  In this video I want to show you a very simple face yoga exercise you can do any time anywhere.  I love to do this one when I am jogging or running so my cheeks don't go down.  First slightly move your chin forward.  Then slightly move your lips up and over your teeth.  Smile and lift up the corners of your mouth.  Push your tongue against the roof of the mouth and hold for ten seconds.  Now let's do it again.  Chin forward, curl your lower lip, smile, lift up the corners of your mouth.  Chin up.  Make sure and do the tongue push up in this exercise.  By adding the tongue to the pose it really helps to lift up your cheeks and tone your neckline.  Don't you love this? If you like this video, please \"like it\".  If you do not have my free face yoga ebook  please come on over to face yoga method.com and get it now to get started.\n\nPlease go to http://faceyogamethod.com/webinar to watch a special webinar for face yoga and get a tour of my membership site.\n\nThe face yoga method works for all areas of the face not just the cheeks.  You can use face yoga to firm and tighten the muscles in your jawline, around your eyes, around your mouth and on your forehead.  Try the face yoga method and you will see results but please be sure and stay consistent with your practice. Practice makes perfect, so keep at it.  Please don't give up.\n\nI want you to be one of my next face yoga success stories!  Please be sure and look at the before/after photos on my blog.

The fourth link is to a googlebooks pdf book written by Andrew Blackbird in 1887, titled History of the Ottawa and Chippewas Indians of Michigan. Blackbird wrote that Chippewas or Anishinabe, was extensively spoken among the Shoshone which means the Shoshone are Chippewas. It is on pages 89 and 90.

Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family, nor are they from Guinea. They originated in the Andes, and earlier studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggested they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as Cavia aperea, C. fulgida, or C. tschudii and, therefore, do not exist naturally in the wild. Recent studies applying molecular markers,in addition to studying the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals,revealed that the ancestor is most likely Cavia tschudii.\n \nThe guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture of many Indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.Since the 1960s, efforts have been made to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.\n \nIn Western societies, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature, their responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them, continue to make the guinea pig a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.\n \nBiological experimentation on guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were frequently used as a model organism in the 19th and 20th centuries, resulting in the epithet \"guinea pig\" for a test subject, but have since been largely replaced by other rodents such as mice and rats. They are still used in research, primarily as models for human medical conditions such as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy, and pregnancy complications.", "title": "10\u65e5\u76ee\u3000\u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u6211\u304c\u5bb6\u306b\u3084\u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f \u30cf\u30e0\u30b0\u30c3\u30ba4", "publishedDate": "2013-05-20T22:58:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "0mFeFiWqiLQ", "description": "A great song by Oscillator Z!

Good Luck!\n\nalienation\n\nAlienation is the transferring of property from one owner to another. An \"alienation clause\" or a \"due-on-sale\" clause is typical within a loan agreement and it says that if the property is transferred in any way, then the balance of the loan is due. This is important to a loan company because their agreement is with a current owner, not some subsequent owner. (A loan assumption clause has been a part of loans in the past, but is not currently that common.) Alienation is another word for selling, transferring or giving a property from one owner to another. Synonyms: transfer, convey Related Words: convey, transfer, due-on-sale clause, acceleration clause\n\nMultiple Choice Question \n\nalienation\nA extra cash or non-like property put into an exchange\nB holding a property\nC removal of a bidding company for a legal violation\nD transferring, conveying, or selling of property\n\nCorrect Answer: d\n\nIf you would like to suggest corrections to this word, email us at actlevel42@gmail.com.

Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae are the only surviving family of the order proboscidea; other, now extinct, families of the order include mammoths and mastodons. The largest living terrestrial animals, male African elephants can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes, particularly for grasping objects. In addition to their trunks, their incisors grow into tusks, which serve as tools for moving objects and digging and as weapons for fighting. The elephant's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of its body. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\n\nElephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance, and predators such as lions, tigers, hyenas and wild dogs usually target only the young elephants (or \"calves\"). Females (\"cows\") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch, often the oldest cow. Elephants have a fission-fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Males (\"bulls\") leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.\n\nSource :-Wikipedia\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

From the story:\nThe Hymn of Acxiom is...a beautiful work that gets progressively creepier as it continues. Teng uses the piece to capture the way people related to technology and the information gathered about them, and there's almost a religious quality to it.\n\"I think the reason we agree to be spied on, basically, is that, on some level, we do want to be known,\" she says. \"There is that unsettling parallel with religion and the way technology works now. At some level, as human beings, we have this deep need, this deep desire to be understood, to be seen, to have the sense that someone knows everything we do.\n\"Then there's the question of what that entity does with that knowledge. In religion, the message is that God loves you and embraces you while holding you accountable for being your best self. Whether Acxiom databases do that is much more questionable.\"\n\nLyrics:\nSomebody hears you. You know that.

We received a flyer in the mail from Valley View letting us know about their dental services in the community and this is how we based our decision along with reading some other reviews.\n\nMaking an appointment at Valley View was very simple and accommodating with appointment times.  They also offer to send out new patient paperwork allowing you to fill it out while at home instead of showing up to your appointment 30 minutes early which I thought was great.  They confirm all appointments via text which is great as I always schedule it into my Calendar when I respond.\n\nThe Staff....\n\nI interacted with several members of the staff in the office and they were all very nice and friendly including the dentist Dr. Newman who was very friendly during the x-ray and oral examination in my checkup and checked to see if I had any concerns besides the cavity I had to come back for.\n\nDentists in Roanoke VA Blue Ridge Dental Group OfficeThe Office Building....\n\nThe office building at Valley View was very nice and up to date.  It looked like it was fairly new and when I asked them I believe it was just over a year since they had moved into the building.  During my examination they didn't just take x-rays but also did a pen camera of your mouth to get the full picture.  Out of all the dentists that I have been to in my life I would say they are on top of their game.\n\nI would highly recommend Dr. Newman for any of your dental needs at the Valley View office in Roanoke, VA.\n\nBest part of my office visit..... they allow you to choose your music you listen to while they do your cleaning or procedure.\n\nContact Information:\n\nDentists in Roanoke VA Blue Ridge Dental Group Valley View\n\nDentists-in-Roanoke-VA-Blue-Ridge-Dental-Group-Contact-info\nContact Info\n\nPhone: (540) 904-0300\n\nEmail Address: nrke@blueridgedentalgroup.com\n\nHours: Monday -- Thursday 8am to 5pm\n\nDentists in Roanoke VA  Blue Ridge Dental Group\n\nDentists in Roanoke VA Blue Ridge Dental Group Valley View Map\nClick Here for Google Map", "title": "Roanoke VA Dentists", "publishedDate": "2014-06-27T22:11:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "0n4fcIv8xiY", "description": "One of my Caiman Lizards feeding on a Edible Snail (without shell).", "title": "Dracaena guianensis feeding on Edible Snails", "publishedDate": "2007-12-06T11:28:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "0n4tqhBd0h4", "description": "What if the ground was made of trampolines?\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\n\u25ba PLAY our iPHONE GAME - http://smarturl.it/DPGameiPhone\n\u25ba VISIT our NEW STORE! - http://bit.ly/Dude_Perfect_Store\n\nMusic: \"Right as Rain\" by Courrier\n\nhttp://iTunes.com/courrier\nhttp://facebook.com/courriermusic\nhttp://youtube.com/courriermusic\nhttp://courriermusic.com\n\nYes it was as fun as it looked!\nJumpstreet\u00ae | indoor trampoline park\nhttp://www.gotjump.com\n\nSome of our biggest videos ever are coming out soon so stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/DudePerfect \n\nIn between videos we hang out with you guys on Instagram, Vine, Twitter, and Facebook so pick your favorite one and hang with us there too! \n\nhttp://Instagram.com/DudePerfect\nhttps://Vine.co/DudePerfect\nhttp://Twitter.com/DudePerfect\nhttp://Facebook.com/DudePerfect\n\nDo you have a GO BIG mindset? \nSee for yourself in our book \"Go Big.\" \nhttp://amzn.to/OYdZ2s\n\nA special thanks to those of you who play our iPhone Game and read our book.

regime.\n\nAugust 27, 2011 -- In protest to diversion of many rivers that feed one of the largest salty lake in the world, Lake Orumieh in north western Iran residents of the city of Orumieh poured to the streets of the city despite the heavy presence of security and anti-riot forces on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe security forces have cracked down on peaceful protesters and used tear gas to disperse them resulting in the injury of many protesters.\n\nThis latest protest in the city of Urmia started following a rejection of proposed legislation by the Iranian parliament that would transfer urgent waters into the Lake Urmia to save a great lake from disappearing due to damming and development.\nThe long popular lake, home to migrating flamingos, pelicans and gulls, has shrunken by 60 percent and could disappear entirely in just a few years, a Washington Post report in May confirmed; experts say drained by drought, misguided irrigation policies, development and the damming of rivers that feed it.\nDrying of Lake Urmia also sparked large protest on Friday April 2, 2010, security agents attacked environmental activists who gathered at Lake Urmia to demonstrate against the drying of the lake caused by neglect from authorities.\n\n\u0635\u062d\u0646\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0631\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0645 \u0628\u0627

His father was a native of Ogbomosho, while his mother was a member of the Bachama tribe. He underwent secondary education at the government college, Okene (in present day Kogi State). He enlisted in the Nigerian Army in 1958 shortly after completing his school certificate examinations. He passed the army selection examinations and thereafter was despatched to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK, the British Army's initial officer entry academy. He was commissioned 2nd Lieutenant on December 15, 1960. As a platoon commander, he served in Kasai Province of Congo with the 1st Battalion, Queen's Own Nigeria Regiment during his first ONUC UN peace keeping tour of duty. In 1962, Lt. Adekunle became Aide-de-Camp to the governor of the eastern region, Sir Akanu Ibiam. The following year, as a Captain, he was posted back to the Congo as Staff Captain (A) to the Nigerian Brigade HQ at Luluabourg - under Brigadier B. Ogundipe. In 1964, Major Adekunle attended the Defence Services Staff College at Wellington, in India. When he returned he was briefly appointed Adjutant General at the Army Headquarters in May 1965 to replace Lt. Col. Yakubu Gowon, who was proceeding on a course outside the country. However, he later handed over the position to Lt. Col. James Pam and was posted back to his old Battalion (1st Bn) in Enugu as a Company Commander.\nNigerian Civil War\n\nAdekunle later assumed command of the Lagos Garrison as a substantive Lt. Col. When the Nigerian Civil War erupted in July 1967, Adekunle was tasked to lead elements which included two new battalions (7th and 8th) - to conduct the historic sea borne assault on Bonny in the Bight of Benin on 26 July 1968 (carried out by Major Isaac Adaka Boro's unit). This happened after the federal government gained confidence of most south western ethnic groups as a direct result of Biafran push to mid-west state and probe into Western region. Adekunle was promoted to Colonel after the Bonny landing.\n\nThe 6th (under Major Jalo) and 8th (under Major Ochefu) battalions of the Lagos Garrison subsequently took part in operations to liberate the Midwest following the Biafran invasion of August 1967. The 7th (under Major Abubakar) stayed behind to hold Bonny. Because Major Jalo's outfit was seconded to Lt. Col. Murtala Mohammed's 2nd Division, Adekunle was left with only the 8th Battalion at Escravos. He, therefore, protested to Army HQ and got the Lagos garrison upgraded to Brigade status through the creation of the 31 and 32 Battalions (under Majors Aliyu and Hamman, respectively). This formation, combined with elements of the Lagos garrison along the eastern seaboard, was officially designated the 3 Infantry Division.[1] However, Colonel Adekunle did not think the name \"3 Infantry Division\" was sensational enough nor did it project the nature of the unique terrain in which his men had to fight. Therefore, without formal approval from Army HQ, he renamed it the \" 3 Marine Commando (3MCDO).\" The \"Black Scorpion\" as he came to be known, was easily the most controversial, celebrated and mythologized figure[citation needed] in the war of attrition that laid the foundations for Nigeria's contemporary crisis; and threw a wedge into the national fabric. Benjamin \"Adekunle's boys in the Midwest seized Escravos, Burutu, Urhonigbe, Owa and Aladima. They captured Bomadi and Patani, Youngtown, Koko, Sapele, Ajagbodudu, Warri, Ughelli, Orerokpe, Umutu and Itagba\".[2]", "title": "It was the scum intro halloween 2013 album part 1 rockefeller\\rothschild\\arms dealers nwo diss", "publishedDate": "2013-10-22T19:59:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "0nL2Mv-1X3Y", "description": "Checking out the hairstyles on opening night.

I am very happy to say I am still marketing his business today.\n\nIn this video I want to talk to you today about the importance of customer reviews to your Google and YouTube Search Engine Rankings. The higher the number of total reviews your business receives the better your chances are of Page 1 Search Ranking Results.\n\nOne very effective, low cost way to receive, a lot more reviews.  Is by sending a Thank You for your Business Greeting Card to every customer after the transaction is completed.  You may think that the cost time and money may be too high for your small business. But the service I use.  Takes me under 5 minutes to mail out a custom thank you card with my photo printed on it with my custom message and signed by me. All this for under a cost of $2 each, and that includes the envelope and postage stamp too. In short thank your customer for their business provide a custom short web page address to post their customer review of your business. Many businesses will offer a small prize or discount on the next product they buy.  This is a great way to build customer loyalty, building a growing number of customer reviews and to Boost your chances to Google and YouTube Search Page 1 Results.\n\nThe higher the cost of your products and services you provide the more important customer reviews are to the Advertising Success of your Business.\n\nIf the cost of your products is under $1 very few people would go to all the trouble and research to find the best place to buy it. Most of the time products under $30 are with in a dollar or two no matter where you buy it. Service and convenience are the largest factors were a customer buys. \n\nBut if you were thinking about hiring a contractor to remodel your home. Then customer reviews will become a very important part of your buying decision.\n\nFor more information or help on setting up a cost effective Direct Mail Campaign by sending Thank you for your Business greeting cards to past customers.\n\n I am all ways happy to help, Phone Me at area code (916) 672-1132 today!\nor click on the link in the video description to www.LeesCards.com.\n\nThank you for watching, bye for now!\n\n\n\nhttp://www.LeesCards.com/\n\nhttp://www.5HrWeek.com/\n\nGoogle Maps\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps/place?hl=en&georestrict=input_srcid:47c33017ea6e3b5f", "title": "Mailing List Direct Mail Advertising Campaign Record Sales", "publishedDate": "2011-11-10T01:55:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "0nPzlAxc5fg", "description": "Sz\u00f6veg\u00e9rt nyisd le!\n\nBEAT: Free Rap Beat-funny(Samybeats)\nMIX/MASTER: Gripe\n\nEl\u00e9rhet\u0151s\u00e9gek\nSzecska: https://www.facebook.com/richard.szecsi\nGripe: https://www.facebook.com/anevemgripe\n\nCsatlakozzatok facebookon\nSzecska: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Szecska/613811495298928?fref=ts\nGripe: https://www.facebook.com/GriPeOFFICIAL\n\nSz\u00f6veg:\n\nSZECSKA\n\n\u00c9n el\u00fct\u00f6m az id\u0151t, de ha te nem,\nhat elem se el\u00e9g, hogy visszaforgasd ellenem!\nNem j\u00e1r visszafele a mutat\u00f3 de tudhatn\u00e1d,\nnem tehetek r\u00f3la hogy te le ragadt\u00e1l a m\u00faltadn\u00e1l!\n\nT\u00fal adt\u00e1l magadon, ez basz agyon, szavadon\nfoglak, \u00edgy te nem maradsz szabadon!\n\u00c1gy\u0151 mint a nagy \u00far, senki se k\u00edv\u00e1ncsi r\u00e1d,\naz \u00e9n csapatom elit a tieid sim\u00e1n cs\u00edr\u00e1k!\n\nAzt mondod nekem: Dzsih\u00e1d!

Well this was just unacceptable for the passenger, who started cursing and banging on the partition inside the taxi. Of course, this was distracting for Fahd, who hit a pothole.\n\nFahd stopped at a gas station on Avenue C and 23rd Street to check on his car, and this was when the passenger came up behind him and whacked him in the face with the skateboard.\n\nAn ambulance driver who was nearby tried chasing the attacker down the street, but he ended up escaping on his skateboard.\n\nFahd was left with a fractured nose, facial cuts and swelling so bad he couldn't open his left eye.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

The time of his birth and death are uncertain: most early 20th-century historians dated his lifetime as c. 563 BCE to 483 BCE; more recently, however, at a specialist symposium on this question,[2] the majority of those scholars who presented definite opinions gave dates within 20 years either side of 400 BCE for the Buddha's death, with others supporting earlier or later dates.\n\nGautama, also known as \u015a\u0101kyamuni or Shakyamuni (\"sage of the Shakyas\"), is the key figure in Buddhism, and accounts of his life, discourses, and monastic rules are believed by Buddhists to have been summarized after his death and memorized by his followers. Various collections of teachings attributed to Gautama were passed down by oral tradition, and first committed to writing about 400 years later. Early Western scholarship tended to accept the biography of the Buddha presented in the Buddhist scriptures as largely historical, but currently \"scholars are increasingly reluctant to make unqualified claims about the historical facts of the Buddha's life and teachings.\"[3]\n\nAfter asceticism and concentrating on meditation and Anapana-sati (awareness of breathing in and out), Siddhartha is said to have discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way\u2014a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification. He accepted a little milk and rice pudding from a village girl named Sujata, who wrongly believed him to be the spirit that had granted her a wish, such was his emaciated appearance. Then, sitting under a pipal tree, now known as the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India, he vowed never to arise until he had found the Truth. Kaundinya and the other four companions, believing that he had abandoned his search and become undisciplined, left. After 49 days meditating, at the age of 35, he attained Enlightenment; according to some traditions, this occurred approximately in the fifth lunar month, and according to others in the twelfth. Gautama, from then on, was known as the Buddha or \"Awakened One.\" Buddha is also sometimes translated as \"The Enlightened One.\" Often, he is referred to in Buddhism as Shakyamuni Buddha or \"The Awakened One of the Shakya Clan.\"\n\nAt this point, he is believed to have realized complete awakening and insight into the nature and cause of human suffering which was ignorance, along with steps necessary to eliminate it. This was then categorized into 'Four Noble Truths'; the state of supreme liberation\u2014possible for any being\u2014was called Nirvana. He then allegedly came to possess the Nine Characteristics, which are said to belong to every Buddha.\n\nInfo Taken from Wikipedia.com\nCredits to Wikipedia.com\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha\n\nMain", "title": "Buddha Temple, Ko Samui by Asiatravel.com", "publishedDate": "2009-09-07T04:38:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "0nXdfjvr6fs", "description": "Ni g\u00f6r ett fantastiskt jobb, och det f\u00f6rs\u00f6ker vi g\u00f6ra f\u00f6r er ocks\u00e5.

Im\u00e1genes en las instalaciones interiores de Bioparc Valencia.\n\nViernes, 22 de noviembre de 2013. Tras m\u00e1s de 9 meses de gestaci\u00f3n, el pasado d\u00eda 14 de este mes nac\u00eda en BIOPARC la primera cr\u00eda de Bongo Oriental (Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci) en Valencia. Hace poco menos de un a\u00f1o los progenitores llegaron a Valencia procedentes, el macho de B\u00e9lgica y la hembra de Jerez. Esta joven pareja de 4 y 5 a\u00f1os respectivamente, ten\u00eda la importante labor de incorporarse al programa de conservaci\u00f3n (EEP) que se est\u00e1 llevando a cabo a nivel europeo y este nacimiento supone un gran \u00e9xito. La hembra, aunque primeriza, est\u00e1 criando perfectamente al precioso bongo y, hasta el momento, ambos se encuentran en muy buen estado. \n\nEl bongo oriental o bongo de monta\u00f1a que habita en Bioparc es una subespecie catalogada \"en peligro cr\u00edtico\" seg\u00fan la Lista Roja de la UICN (Uni\u00f3n internacional para la conservaci\u00f3n de la naturaleza). En tiempos recientes su poblaci\u00f3n silvestre ha sufrido un serio declive, debido a la destrucci\u00f3n de su fr\u00e1gil ecosistema monta\u00f1oso por la tala ilegal y el pastoreo de ganado dom\u00e9stico. El ganado vacuno, adem\u00e1s, transmite graves enfermedades frente a las que los bongos carecen de defensas. Y a pesar de su grave situaci\u00f3n, la especie sigue sometida a la presi\u00f3n de la caza furtiva.\n\nHoy quedan menos de 100 ejemplares en estado silvestre, en los Aberdares, el Monte Kenya y otras dos poblaciones aisladas. Su situaci\u00f3n y perspectivas de recuperaci\u00f3n son muy desfavorables, ya que est\u00e1 por debajo del dintel cr\u00edtico de 250 individuos, necesarios para garantizar la variabilidad gen\u00e9tica para la recuperaci\u00f3n de la especie, y adem\u00e1s, ninguna de las 4 poblaciones supera los 50 individuos.

The Pantanal is the world's largest freshwater wetland and in recent years it has become increasingly threatened by large development programmes and changes in land management practices. Since 2005, the RZSS Pantanal Conservation and Research initiative has been conducting scientific research to create, implement and evaluate conservation actions and sustainable land management strategies. Results from the Pantanal are used to promote conservation throughout Brazil and internationally.\n\nIn partnership with IPE (Institute for Ecological Research) RZSS, as well as North American and European zoos, participates in the Pantanal Giant Armadillo Project which is a long term ecological study on the secretive giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus) about which virtually nothing is known.\n\nAfter almost two years of preparation the Pantanal Giant Armadillo project started in June 2011. This is currently the only project in the world to be focused on this species.  Although giant armadillos range over much of South America almost nothing is known about them and most information is anecdotal. Due to its cryptic behaviour and low population densities, this animal is very rarely seen. The giant armadillo is currently classified as Vulnerable (A2cd) by the IUCN/SSC Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nThe main goal of the project is to investigate the ecology and biology of the species and understand its function in the ecosystem using radio transmitters, camera traps, burrow surveys, resource monitoring, resource mapping and interviews.  In 2011 from June to December five giant armadillos were captured.  Because the species is so rare, it is very very difficult to find. \n\nThe project is integrating its findings into local and National initiatives. At the end of 2012 the first steps to evaluate and use data to assess the status of giant armadillos according to the IUCN/SCC red list criteria will be taken. Data will also be compiled for population viability analysis. \n\nRZSS work on many different fronts in Brazilian, the Pantanal Giant Armadillo Project being one of them.

The ship however was Kirk's pride and joy; it was his baby. The Enterprise to Kirk was like Excalibur to King Arthur. Like the Endeavour to Captain Cook and the Bounty to Captain Bligh, the Enterprise was an extension of Kirk's indomitable valour and courage.\n \nThe Search for Spock was the third film 'spin-off' from the original tv series. The Enterprise had thus far undergone several refits to the interior and the old warp engines had been replaced. The ship, generally, had a more slick appearance in contrast to the Enterprise of the original series. For the purposes of story continuity this was the original ship, alas now a weary old battle cruiser sitting in space dock in the process of being decommissioned.\n\nKirk learns that Spock may not be dead after all and he attempts to requisition the Enterprise from Starfleet in order to rescue his old shipmate. Permission is denied. To Kirk, this is not a refusal but a challenge, so he commandeers the ship anyway and is subsequently chased out of space dock... the prospect of his career in tatters for theft and insubordination.\n\nAnd so the Enterprise, with her loyal and gallant crew risking all for their shipmate, sets off on the quest to find Spock.\n\nIn this scene, the Enterprise is orbiting the Genesis planet: a failed geological experiment to seed life on other worlds with the intention of creating earth-like conditions for future habitat and colonisation. In the wrong hands, the Genesis device is a capable weapon of mass destruction.\n\nA band of renegade Klingons, the old adversaries of Starfleet and the Federation, are hell-bent on seizing the Genesis device, potentially shifting the balance of power against the Federation. In a brief debacle with the Klingon Bird of Prey, the now cranky Enterprise is paralysed and Kirk and crew are defenseless hostages aboard their own ship.\n\nThe Klingon leader is demanding the blueprint for the Genesis device and aims to kill the hostages one by one until Kirk hands it over. Kirk's son David is among a group of hostages already held captive on the planet's surface and is the first to be murdered as he attempts to defend the others.

The stages of living between these events: childhood, adolescence, adulthood, parenthood and senior are themselves natural and in accord with the needs of the species and most individuals. Many find their satisfaction in living this course and to these individuals I have little or nothing to say. Others though long for something more; something innate, genetic and seemingly calling. Adventure and change can give a degree of satisfaction and relief yet even these may seem too tame. To those who feel drawn to something beyond the entertainment and stimulation of senses I offer a walk along The Path of Wildness. Don't bother penciling the event in your schedule, preparing a pack with goodies and supplies or even inviting a friend along, for this experience is along the course of your first inclination and you must surely always go alone.\n\nLearn more about The Path of Wildness here:\nhttp://wp.me/P5A2F-As\n\n====\n\nCHANNEL CREDITS\n\n\"Japanese Falls\" image by the artist Lane Brown.

Senior WR DeVante Parker hauls in eight catches and breaks the century mark in receiving yards, while running back Michael Dyer notches a touchdown on 24 rushes and gains 173 yards.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/Oqg3iE\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States in which its fifteen member universities compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA's) Division I, with its football teams competing in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest levels for athletic competition in US-based collegiate sports. The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "NC State vs Louisville | 2014 ACC Football Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-10-19T00:57:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "0nzRMK2cO4I", "description": "", "title": "Paucity @Intersection CD release party", "publishedDate": "2009-11-23T12:18:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "0nza2gdK1ZI", "description": "READ THIS BEFORE POSTING!\n\nVideo Made by: Anti Noob, I am not Anti Noob, I am AfRo SaUcE.\n\nThis description is not meant to show how to \"make the ghost come\" cause there is really no such thing as a ghost so please stop sending messages asking how to make him come.\n\nThe only reason im posting this video is to explain that the Ghost Of Lockout is not a mod and is in fact a network glitch..\n\nBefore you all come up in here spamming that this is a mod, its not and I'll explain. Here's how it works: The \"Ghost\" is actually a person in the game that the host (in this case, Anti Noob) can only see as a default spartan sliding around with no walking animation. Now you're probably saying \"How can he have no walking animation without a mod?\" Well, you cant mod spartans and elites to have no animation or you're game is bound to freeze. That also goes for the \"auto-sticking\". On Anti Noobs screen he sees the \"ghost\" of course as I said before a default white spartan and he is sliding everywhere and has no animations.. this also means he really doesnt have a turning animation. How he has the grenade throwing and shooting animations is caused by the lag giving him those attributes. Now on the person that is the \"ghost\" 's screen he is actually walking and turning around and doing all sorts of stuff that you cant see on Anti Noobs screen. Another way to prove its not a mod is that back when this video was made it was IMPOSSIBLE to mod old maps (I.E. Lockout) on Xbox Live. As you can see this is filmed on Xbox Live because you can see Lag/Ping bars next to their names whenever he holds back or dies. All you guys that think its a Bungie/Xbox Live Admin... think again, that is the stupidest thing you could ever think of that would happen in Halo 2 more or less Xbox Live. Admins cannot join your games without names nor can they spy on you or any crap like that. No such thing or bungie would have revealed it by now. There is no frame skipping, I dont see why someone would frame skip to lie about something on a damn video game. No frame skipping! This video isn't new by the way its well over a year old, before you could mod old maps online... Anyway yeah I think thats about it. No mod just a network glitch.\n\nNote: I cant reply in the comments thingy cause for some reason it keeps saying I need flash player or its turned off but when I go to a different vid it works.. So If you want me to reply to you I'll just PM you or somethin.\n\nTo BobTheBasher: If you were to change the characteristics* of a character(I.E. Elite or Spartan) The game would freeze unless it had something to replace it, Cheerz, noob.\n\nEdit: I have stopped the ability to post, people are getting too annoying so yeah.\n\nEdit: Stop messaging me saying \"I believe you, my friend said he saw a ghost in Halo 1\" or \"my friend saw one in system link when he was waiting for his friends to join at a LAN party.\" That's bullshit, it only happens on Live.", "title": "Ghost Of Lockout by Anti Noob and Underdogg", "publishedDate": "2006-07-28T16:38:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "0o-IAX2tH9w", "description": "[Click 'Show More']\n\n\nRetweeting everyone who shares this video by clicking this link!\nhttp://clicktotweet.com/Fp104\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScotch bonnet pepper\nChallenge\nScotch bonnet pepper challenge\n\n\n\nactivism, advertising, alcohol, alternative-news, ancient-history, animals, animation, anime, architecture, arts, astronomy, atheist, bizarre, blogs, books, buddhism, business, cars, cartoons, cats, celebrities, christianity, classic-rock, clothing, comedy-movies, comics, computer-graphics, computer-hardware, computers, cooking, crafts, crime, cyberculture, dogs, drawing, drugs, ecommerce, environment, fashion, fine-arts, firefox, geography, graphic-design, guitar, guns, hacking, health, history, humor, illusions, interior-design, internet, internet-tools, iraq, liberal-politics, liberties, linguistics, linux, literature, mac-os, mathematics, movies, multimedia, music, nature, network-security, news, online-games, open-source, painting, philosophy, photography, physics, poetry, politics, programming, psychology, quizzes, relationships, religion, satire, science, science-fiction, self-improvement, shopping, software, space-exploration, stumblers, stumbleupon, tattoos, travel, tv, video, video-games, web-design, windows, writing, actors, america, apple, art, aviation, blog, blogging, bush, california, car, cartoon, cat, celebrity, charity, children, climate-change, college, comedy, comic, community, dance, death, debate, design, diet, diy, dog, economy, election, elections, energy, entertainment, exercise, facebook, film, finance, flash, flowers, food, football, funny, gadgets, game, games, gaming, global-warming, god, google, graffiti, green, home, humour, illustration, images, internet-marketing, life, living, love, mac, marriage, math, media, medicine, microsoft, money, music-video, obama, oil, online, paintings, pakistan, peace, photo, photos, photoshop, pictures, pirates, president, quotes, recipe, recipes, republican, rock, sculpture, security, social-media, social-networking, society, space, star-wars, tech, technology, television, tips, tools, tutorials, ubuntu, vegan, video, videos, vintage, war, water, web, web-development, weird, wordpress, youtube, sex, sexy, hot, love, porn, president, 2008, 2009, winter, secret, omg, no, way, amplafitesttag, art, arts, bank, barackobama, bi, bisexual, blues, broadway, business, c, canvass, children, classical, college, comedy, community, communityservice, concert, conference, convention, country, county, dance, debatewatchparty, design, development, drive, election, election08, entrepreneur, event, events, fair, family, festival, field, filmfest, florida, football, for, free, fun, fundraising, halloween, haunted, indie, iowavoteearlyforchangeweekofac, jazz, kids, league, live, local, localfieldoffice, london, management, marketing, media, meeting, music, musicals, mybo, national, networking, new, nfl, nyc, obama, of, office, organizing, party, performance, phone, phonebank, pop, pride, prideevent, pridefest, registration, rock, service, show, shows, social, sport, sports, startup, technology, theater, tour, voter, voterregistrationdrive, w, web, western, women, women for obama, workshop, , free, money, cash, movie, download", "title": "SCOTCH BONNET PEPPER CHALLENGE", "publishedDate": "2013-06-08T19:29:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "0o-NPp-3mi4", "description": "www.cannibalcarib.com support the underground", "title": "CANNIBAL CARIB -SLAM", "publishedDate": "2012-08-20T05:51:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "0o-vIextsiM", "description": "EBOLA: 13 Iowans being Monitored for Possible Ebola Virus!\nhttp://whotv.com/2014/11/07/iowan-remains-quarantined-for-possible-ebola-virus-hospitals-continue-training-methods/\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

In the metropolitan area of \u200b\u200bBuffalo - Niagara over 1.2 million inhabitants. Buffalo is the administrative seat of Erie County and is located not far from Niagara Falls, on the northeast corner of Lake Erie . Today Buffalo is a modern industrial city and port .\n\nThe name comes from Buffalo \" Buffalo Creek \", which from 1759 to 1760 first appeared on a map ; the origin of this name is not assignable .\n\nIn German-speaking countries Buffalo probably best known for the poem John Maynard by Theodor Fontane. A hint of this poem bronze plaque was unveiled in Buffalo in 1997.\n\nThe Art Deco - style built City Hall Buffalo's 115 meters one of the tallest public building in the United States. It is on the National Register of Historic Places , as well as about seventy additional objects in the city. The proposed by Frank Lloyd Wright Darwin D. Martin House is a National Historic Landmark.\n\nLION\n\nAfter the tiger , the lion is the second largest cat making it the largest land predator in Africa. A male lion has a body length of 170 to 250 centimeters , a shoulder height of up to 123 centimeters and a tail length of approximately one meter. Adult males arrive on an average body weight of 190 kilograms. The variation ranges 150-225 kg in exceptional cases up to 272 kg. Females are at 140 and 175 cm body length , a shoulder height of 100 centimeters and a 85 cm long tail considerably more delicate and have a body weight of around 126 kilograms. On average, lions have a greater shoulder height than Tiger , but are overall slightly shorter. The largest lions now live in southern Africa , the smallest in Asia. In zoos and circuses held males reach due to good feeding occasionally a weight of over 300 kilograms.\n\nThe often cited maximum head fuselage length of 250 cm , however, are not attested sure of today's lions and fit at best to the greatest forms of Pleistocene lions , such as the American lion . After Maz\u00e1k , the average total length , ie the length including the tail, with today's male lions about 260 to 270 cm , rarely more than 285 cm. The most credible traditional measures of length for lion lying at about 305-310 cm total length, measured in a direct line ( between pegs ) from the nose to the tip of the tail to the north in an animal from the area of Lake Victoria .", "title": "Buffalo Fatally Wounded Lion - Animal Fight TV", "publishedDate": "2014-06-05T17:17:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "0o1mPbAUyxU", "description": "V\u00eddeo em time-lapse mostrando nuvens Cumulonimbus, grandes nuvens mammatus e dois rel\u00e2mpagos, vistos em Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, M\u00e9xico, em 30 de outubro de 2012. \nImagem dispon\u00edvel em http://webcamsdemexico.net/leon2/live.jpg", "title": "Cumulonimbus, mammatus and lightning visible from Le\u00f3n, Mexico (time-lapse) - Oct 30, 2012", "publishedDate": "2013-03-02T03:43:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "0o26Y96Anao", "description": "Esta ma\u00f1ana se escaparon dos toros del Rastro Municipal de Guadalajara, los cuales provocaron la movilizaci\u00f3n de polic\u00edas y bomberos en la zona Sur de este municipio", "title": "Escapan dos toros del Rastro Municipal de Guadalajara | Noticias de Guadalajara", "publishedDate": "2014-05-13T00:25:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "0o2IOAJ3HAs", "description": "im trying the skimmed milk challenge with im nearly sick in make sure u subscribe for more challenges and daily vlogs", "title": "Skimmed Milk Challenge (FAIL)", "publishedDate": "2013-08-25T18:34:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "0o2fhkOMgP4", "description": "i feel peace in pain i feel stronger\nthen ever, a release of fear im a\nproduct of perfection of the game\ndark or light one you and me the same\ni touch your heart thoughts created\nare from your brain a uniqness scheduled\nto stop cruelness but i keep the rawness\ncreation is flawless im everything and\ni adore it and if theres a change im on it\nif there is light im the source do what it\ntakes cry or brawling i forgive myself\nfor all the times i allowed myself to be falling\non floor crawling tears storming fears roaming\nscreams in a world i never thought i becoming\nill mc i thank your frequency i blast laughs\nfrequently keep the smile up for me lightworker\nunite the echoes goes on forever in eternity\nlife on earth is like pregnancy oh yes its\na women in me the love is all over me\ni feel what eyes cannot see i squeeze it out\nof me", "title": "Rap the Game back the source", "publishedDate": "2012-11-05T14:17:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "0o2yyO0JAes", "description": "Scientists have just discovered a new, very important reason for you to get a good night's sleep.

However, the absence of jaws in conodonts and the small size of their oropharyngeal musculature limits the force available for fracturing food items, presenting a challenge to this interpretation. We address this issue quantitatively using engineering approaches previously applied to mammalian dentitions. We show that the morphology of conodont food-processing elements was adapted to overcome size limitations through developing dental tools of unparalleled sharpness that maximize applied pressure. Combined with observations of wear, we also show how this morphology was employed, demonstrating how Wurmiella excavata used rotational kinematics similar to other conodonts, suggesting that this occlusal style is typical for the clade. Our work places conodont elements within a broader dental framework, providing a phylogenetically independent system for examining convergence and scaling in dental tools.", "title": "Jawless vertebrate had world's sharpest teeth", "publishedDate": "2012-03-15T00:18:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "0o3mjs8YCuI", "description": "My cat rubs up against her surroundings to spread her scent.", "title": "Innate Behavior :Territoriality", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T22:09:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "0o3uYeS9IC0", "description": "Awesome video of an asiatic cheetah KILLIN IT..", "title": "Cheetah video   Acinonyx jubatus   video 08d", "publishedDate": "2013-11-23T03:00:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "0o48fhT24bE", "description": "A New Logo..

It is the only living member of the genus Neophron. It has sometimes also been known as the White Scavenger Vulture or Pharaoh's Chicken. Like other vultures it soars on thermals and the underwing black and white pattern and wedge tail make it distinctive. It sometimes uses stones to break the eggs of birds making it one of the few birds that make use of tools. Birds that breed in the temperate region migrate south in winter while tropical populations are relatively sedentary.

But her journey is just at the beginning.\n\nHer story ...\n***\nRO ? EN below\n===\nPovestea lui Winnie dateaza deja de 3 luni ...\nPe Winnie am gasit-o pe strada neputandu-se misca pe cand avea o luna si jumatate. Radiografia ne-a aratat ca avea 3 fracturi. Primele 10 zile au fost critice si de tratament intensiv, dar Winnie a trecut cu bine peste acea perioada. Din cauza unor medici incompetenti si indiferenti care nu au vrut sa le asculte cand le spuneam ca este ceva in neregula cu Winnie, ca are o umflatura la burtica si ca piciorul drept s-a umflat foarte mult, Winnie era sa moara. Dar Winnie a avut noroc si am gasit o doamna doctor sufletista, care m-a ascultat cu atentie si surpriza: avea o tumora, o infectie probabil de dinainte de a o gasi eu si care acum se manifesta, infectie care ii cuprinsese deja piciorusul fracturat. Doamna doctor a salvat-o si la dansa mergem de atunci. Winnie nu ar fi supravietuit.\nPe 25 iulie a inceput infiltratiile in coloana si gimnastica de recuperare, dupa ce rana s-a vindecat complet.\nA reusit sa faca 10 sedinte, cand o noua incercare a urmat pentru Winnie: brusc s-a constipat si desi pe 15 sept i s-a facut clisma, aceasta nu a avut succes, astfel ca pe 16 septembrie a fost operata. Diagnostic megacolon. Incepand cu acea data, mancarea lui Winnie devenea clasica: doar bobite cu fibre. Si in zilele care au urmat, desi a mancat doar mancarea speciala, constipatia s-a instalat din nou si pe data de 24 septembrie, a suferit o a doua operatie, tot megacolon.\n\nAcum se reface, mananca doar bobite cu fibre inmuiate in apa sau supa. Este vioaie, alearga, are scaune moi si in fiecare zi, a inceput sa faca pisu singurica tot mai mult, si rareori mai este nevoie sa ii golim vezica ... Dar inca are nevoie de acele infiltratii in coloana si gimnastica de recuperare, care au dat rezultate incepand cu cea de-a sasea sedinta. Isi flexeaza piciorusul drept care statea ca un bat, si incepe sa mearga aproape normal.

Had only 5-6 weeks. Radiography showed us he had three fractures. The first 10 days were critical and she had needed intensive care, but Winnie went well over that period. Due to few incompetent and indifferent doctors who would not listen when I told them there is something wrong with Winnie, that she has a bulge in the belly and the back right leg was swollen very much, Winnie was almost to die. But Winnie was lucky and I found a doctor hearted lady which listened me carefully and surprise: Winnie had a tumor, an infection present in her body before find her but who started manifesting at that moment. The doctor saved her and since then that lady become Winnie's personal doctor. Winnie would not have survived.\n\nOn July 25th she started the spine infiltrations and gymnastics recovery after the wound has healed completely.\nShe managed to do 10 sessions, when a new attempt followed for Winnie: suddenly she constipated and although on September 15th was made enema, it wasn't successful. Next day on September 16th was operated again. The diagnostic was: megacolon. Since that time, Winnie's food was just fiber food. And in the days that followed, though only ate special food, the constipation installed again. On September 24th, was needed for the second surgery, with the same diagnostic.\n\nNow is recovering, eating only fiber food soaked in water or soup. It is lively, running around the house, has soft stools each day, started to pee alone and only sometimes she needs help to empty the bladder ... But still needs those spine infiltrations and gymnastics recovery, that have had results starting with the sixth session. She can flex their right foot which before couldn't do it at all and started to walk almost normally.

And it's funny.\n\nWritten and directed by husband-and-wife team Kim Evey and Greg Benson of Mediocre Films (one of the most subscribed to content producers on YouTube), the basic premise of the series is pretty much laid out in the show's theme song: \"He is a cop and he's learning-impaired. He's the retarded policeman.\"\n\nBut, believe me, it's so much more.  Well, sort of.\n\nRetarded Policeman, which is, incidentally, also the name of the main character in the show played by Josh \"The Ponceman\" Perry, is a scripted series about a delightful, adorable, completely corrupt, coked-up and cuddly LAPD officer with Down syndrome.\n\nAt this point, you should be either totally intrigued, incredibly disgusted, or both.  Still, some of the funniest jokes ever told are offensive.  And while there are those who maintain that the abhorrent, no matter how hilarious, always has a tinge of hatred, the trend in recent mainstream comedy (most notably with Farrelly Brothers movies, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Family Guy) is to test that theory.\n\nTruth be told, Perry does seem to be having a good time with his character -- there is no question that he's talented and gets into the role.  And it makes for more comfortable viewing when you come to terms with the fact that his character always has the upper hand in any given situation.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this series, however, is how we (and YouTube commentors) react to it.\n\nIsn't it wrong to portray the mentally disabled as drugged-up, racist and horny simpletons with a fondness for peeing in refrigerators? Isn't it incredibly insensitive to allow Josh Perry to seemingly betray himself and others with his syndrome by playing a completely id-driven and absurd character, whose sole purpose is to amuse and shock us? Isn't it unfair to give mean people just another reason to snicker at the mentally-challenged? Isn't it uncouth to say 'retarded' in this day and age? In other words, isn't it horrible to laugh at Retarded Policeman?\n\nThe humor in Retarded Policeman, and other popular comedies that challenge societal norms and political correctness, has a clever way of turning the focus of the viewer inward.  A powerful device, if you get it.\n\nOf course, there will also be people who will laugh just because of the way the Retarded Policeman says, 'Byeeeeeeee,' when a car drives off.\n\nEither way, though, it works.", "title": "Gun Fight (with Shay Carl) - Retarded Policeman #29", "publishedDate": "2012-03-08T17:00:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ogoEcc7UXQ", "description": "Vocalist cute cats and Sweet dogs \n\nVokalist kediler ve k\u00f6pekler", "title": "Vocalist cute cats and Sweet dogs Vokalist kediler ve k\u00f6pekler", "publishedDate": "2014-03-03T16:43:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "0oh1RC5QTUk", "description": "http://www.planomatic.com/14785\n\nProperty for your consideration.", "title": "139 Garboard Street", "publishedDate": "2013-02-06T22:19:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ohL1rCB8qk", "description": "2006 Sydney hardcore Demo", "title": "Die Trying 4 Turn The Tides", "publishedDate": "2012-07-16T13:05:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ohNPvFDFNk", "description": "Trois li\u00e8vres courent dans la neige (bouquinage ? ).", "title": "LIEVRE dans la neige", "publishedDate": "2013-02-24T18:36:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ohZECVRIlU", "description": "Tutorial di musica.", "title": "Lezioni di musica.

How you baste it is going\nto depend on how you quilt it. If you are going to machine quilt it, you're\ngoing to want to use safety pins and I can show you. We'll do that. If you\nwant to hand quilt it, you're probably better off thread basting it. Let's\njust give you an idea of how we do it with safety pins.\n\nYou're going to always start in the center. You're going to go through all\nthree layers of fabric trying not to disturb the layering. The idea is you\nstart at the middle and work your way outward. That way any wrinkles sort\nof work themselves out to the edges of the quilt.\n\nYou're going to want to put pins approximately, I would say, every four\ninches. That's a good rule of thumb. Just keep going. You start on the\noutside. Actually, basting is my least favorite part of quilting. Probably\nbecause I usually work on really large bed quilts, and pinning takes kind\nof a long time and it's boring and you lean over and your back hurts. It's\na good time to get your really good friends to come over and help you. And\nI mean really good friends.\n\nOnce you've got your whole quilt top pinned, you can remove your tape and\nyou're ready to start quilting.", "title": "How to Baste a Quilt | Quilting", "publishedDate": "2013-06-17T16:35:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "0olONAXyKJ0", "description": "Stargate Universe's Robert Carlyle (Dr Nicholas Rush) promoting his new show 'Once Upon A Time' at Comic Con with his cast-mate Ginnifer Goodwin.", "title": "'Once Upon A Time' Star Robert Carlyle and Ginnifer Goodwin @ Comic-Con 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-07-24T07:52:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "0olsAp7gWzQ", "description": "Here's my best farming base design and defense for Town Hall 5 in Clash of Clans.

It was a lecture on unidentified flying objects or UFOs.\n\nRobert Hastings says for the last 30 years the Freedom of Information Act has helped declassify thousands of documents about UFOs.  He says a number of them deal with UFO activity at nuclear weapons sights.\n\nOver the last 35 years, Hastings has interviewed former and retired Air Force personnel and he says they've gone on the record saying that saucer shaped objects have appeared above missiles just before they malfunctioned.\n\nDuring his hour presentation this evening, Hastings' goal was to let the public know what he's found from declassified information.  Hastings says he has a message for non-believers.\n\n\"There is a distinct and fundamental difference between having an opinion and having an informed opinion.  I've done the research for 30 years and they haven't.  If they wish to indulge themselves with their uninformed opinion there is nothing I can do about that,\" said Hastings.\n\nHastings has a website set up if you'd like to learn more information about his findings and studies.

I'm usually too nervous and shy to talk about it much, but awareness is important, so I'm trying to put myself out there more. Last week when I was about to put my hip back in (as I do with most of my joints many times a day), I thought I'd try to capture it on video since I never get to see myself do this, haha. As far as I know, my hip was subluxed (a partial dislocation), which is quite annoying and painful. Every joint is different (especially from person to person), but when my right hip does this I can almost always get it back by doing what I did in the video. \n\nSo, I decided to upload this as a short informative clip for anyone wanting to see a snapshot of a day in the life of an EDSer, or any friends of mine who are curious about my oddities, or anyone looking to see what a hip going back in sometimes looks/sounds like, or... as a bonus... maybe for anyone who has ever not believed me or any other person dealing with this. =P\n\nAnyways, here you go!\n\nSarah-Jill =)\n\nMore info about EDS:\n\nhttp://www.ednf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2202&Itemid=88889278", "title": "Hip Subluxation Reduction (in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome)", "publishedDate": "2012-11-27T23:07:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "0owc2piUs6g", "description": "Search Pine Tar Sports Cards on facebook\nFollow us on Twitter @pinetarcards", "title": "Pine Tar Sports Cards Tour", "publishedDate": "2014-10-23T22:02:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ox9xDcf214", "description": "Charmosyna placentis", "title": "Loro Parque: Charmosyna placentis", "publishedDate": "2007-05-30T11:31:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "0oxcU-rKsp4", "description": "Here's a Chronicles of Narnia video I made for the song 'Freight Train' from Sara Jackson-Holman's second album, Cardiology.

When a child is one who is diagnosed, it becomes even more difficult to control. One Manchester family found help from an unlikely source: a furry friend named Jubilee.There is nothing like a child and her dog, but this dog could one day help save this little girl's life. For Amy and Adam Green it's been a struggle to make sure Layla has the right amount of insulin. She has Type I Diabetes, which means if her blood sugar is too high it could damage her organs. If it gets too low she could slip into a coma. That is where Jubilee comes in. The dog is trained to smell any fluctuations in the toddler's blood sugar and alert Amy or Adam if something is off. Warren Retrievers in Virginia matched a dog with Layla. They'll continue the training process with the Green family over the next 2 years.Director of Training Cheri Campbell delivered the dog to the Green family, and just moments after meeting Layla, she signaled trouble. Jubilee will paw to signal if Layla's blood sugar is too high or too low. Layla's blood sugar was 260. Normal levels would be between 100-200. After being with the family for just one month, Jubilee may have already saved Layla's life. What looks like an easy game of fetch could save Layla's life one day. Jubie is learning how to fetch and retrieve. She could bring a juice box or even a glucose meter if she needed to.For Layla, it means she has a best friend who will always be watching out for her. An added benefit to having Jubilee: the Greens say taking the dog in public has also helped them educate others on Type I Diabetes.If you would like more information on Warren County Retrievers and their dogs, we have a link posted on Fox17.com under FOX LINKS.", "title": "Diabetic Alert Dog - Kelly Sutton", "publishedDate": "2013-07-19T07:42:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "0pE7F4KnjtE", "description": "", "title": "C\u00f3mo matar tijeretas & barras en el Jard\u00edn", "publishedDate": "2014-07-11T15:26:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "0pESi7JWERM", "description": "Hier aktuelles Video meines Aqua Medic Blenny advance.\nKnop 60 miniSkimmer und Fliessbettfilter mit NP Pellets (50ml) an Ver\u00e4nderungen. 50W LED mit Controller. 2mg Ozon zum Absch\u00e4umer.\nViel Spa\u00df beim Ansehen.", "title": "Aqua Medic Blenny advanced Riffaquarium 80l Nanoriff Reef tank Meerwasseraquarium Korallen SPS LPS", "publishedDate": "2014-04-13T22:34:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "0pErKXDW4fY", "description": "", "title": "Snorkeling at Hulopoe Bay, Lanai", "publishedDate": "2014-02-19T02:51:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "0pExkhdO4iU", "description": "All rights to their respective owners.", "title": "Whiskey Myers - Firewater - Bar, Guitar and a Honky Tonk Crowd", "publishedDate": "2011-05-23T00:48:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "0pF7upuGkSU", "description": "Opening  kunst in de openbare ruimte 'Under Heaven' van L. van Munster onder de A10  Bos en Lommer Amsterdam Nieuw West,  mei 2009.", "title": "'Under Heaven'   Kunst in Amsterdam Nieuw West __________________________________", "publishedDate": "2010-02-26T23:08:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "0pFWwMgWBaE", "description": "ONE POT CHEF COOKBOOKS ON iTUNES BOOKSTORE:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/au/artist/david-chilcott/id478668534?mt=11\n\nRoasted Carrot Soup is a simple yet delicious soup that is very easy to prepare.

These sensations may arise pre-meal or can be elicited by delaying a meal. With self-measurement of BG, subjects can be trained to formally identify and remember these sensations (Hunger Recognition). Subjects can then be trained to ensure that IH is present pre-meal for most meals and that their pre-meal BG is therefore low consistently (IH Meal Pattern). IH includes the epigastric Empty Hollow Sensation (the most frequent and recognizable) as well as less specific sensations such as fatigue or light-headedness which is termed inanition. This report reviews the method for identifying IH and the effect of the IH Meal Pattern on energy balance. In adults, the IH Meal Pattern has been shown to significantly decrease energy intake by one-third, decrease preprandial BG, reduce glycosylated hemoglobin, and reduce insulin resistance and weight in those who are insulin resistant or overweight. Young children as well as adults can be trained in Hunger Recognition, giving them an elegant method for achieving energy balance without the stress of restraint-type dieting.
