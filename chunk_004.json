Here I show Two Common varieties that grow locally, The Narrow Long Leafed  \"Plantago Lanceolata \" & Broad Leafed  \"Plantago Major \" both of which grow in the UK & abroad ...  which I used only yesterday. As we keep Bees, and have them around us all the while, it's good to know we have a regular supply of Plantain, which I needed to use only yesterday .. Ouch.\n\nYou can search for & find more varieties but check before you use them .. These two are fine.\nWarning!! Only pick from areas that you can see are Insecticide & herbicide Spray Free !!!\n\nAs a Bee or Wasp Sting remedy .. Choose a few clean leafs of Plantain from a clean environment, if no water is available, give them a quick clean off with a little of your saliva, then chew them \"Well\" with your front teeth & mixing with saliva between lower lip & teeth until a fine Pulp.\nHaving removed the \"Stinger\", place the Pulp over affected area. \nFirst you'll feel the sting grow a little stronger for a moment or two .. but I promise after only a couple of minutes, you'll hardly know it's there, so great for reliving children, will save a lot of screaming .. Bless .. there'll still be a little discomfort, something like an itch the following day but i find this quite bearable.\n\nCheck the web ! ..  Plantain Is a wonderful Plant that helps cure many ills & is edible, with common names  .. ribwort plantain, English plantain, and narrow leaf plantain & more.\n\nPlantain (Plantago spp.)  ..  the young leaves are edible if the fibrous midribs and veins are removed. The seeds are also edible\nPsyllium (Plantago spp.) are used as herbal remedies. The herb is anti-toxic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, astringent, as well as an expectorant, styptic and diuretic. Externally, a poultice of the leaves is useful for applying to insect bites, poison-ivy rashes, minor cuts, sores & boils. Internally, it is used for coughs and bronchitis, as a tea, tincture, or syrup. The broad-leaved varieties are sometimes used as a leaf vegetable for salads, green sauce & more\n\nPsyillium (Plantago spp) -- helps lower cholesterol and prevents constipation, helps lessen calorie intake and while feeling really full.\n\nFind the Long leafed variety on your lawn, in paving joints & out in the countryside .. Beside pathways & on rough or disturbed ground. \n\nRead about Plantain's History & uses, medical research & health giving qualities.\nhttp://www.toddcaldecott.com/index.php/herbs/learning-herbs/320-plantain\n\nMusic:\n\n~ Sweep Guitars ~\nFrom\nMichel Dezanger\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/micheldezanger", "title": "Nature's Bee Wasp Sting Remedy Plantain Edible & has many healthy uses", "publishedDate": "2011-08-02T21:27:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-BPAyX5mYBs", "description": "Dr. Todd Ginkel, founder of Physicians' Diagnostics & Rehabilitation (PDR Clinics), discusses the potential causes of numbness, pain and tingling in your extremities and how PDR Clinics can help.", "title": "Numbness, Pain & Tingling in Your Extremities", "publishedDate": "2012-08-28T12:05:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "-BPJBoROTIo", "description": "Delfin o Ballena?", "title": "Delfin o Ballena???", "publishedDate": "2006-10-10T20:35:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "-BPwK4lfaDo", "description": "dardanus megistos, marine cleaner crew, kelomang, marine hermit crabs", "title": "dardanus megistos", "publishedDate": "2013-01-08T09:51:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-BQ16P8APHo", "description": "http://www.KinoYoga.com\nAshtanga Yoga Instructor, Kino MacGregor gives a step by step instruction on how to jump back from a seated position in the Ashtanga Yoga method.

Each episode of Hidden Treasures will explore the artifacts, images, collections and unique gems of the ASU Libraries you didn't even realize were available.\n\nThis inaugural episode features social sciences librarian Juliann Couture and Joyce Martin, curator of the Labriola National American Indian Data Center, looking at the Center's display of unique Hopi Kachina dolls. Four of the kachinas (Navan Kachina; Talavi Kachina; Flute Kachina; and Ah\u00f6la Kachina) were created by artist, carver, and former ASU employee Tony Dukepoo as a gift to the libraries in 1979.  The kachina dolls are on display in the Labriola Center located on the 2nd floor of the Hayden Library on the ASU Tempe campus.\n\nWe also get a glance at the Center and all the resources available. The Labriola Center is the most comprehensive center for Indigenous research at the university. You can even search the American Indian Index to see the Labriola Center holdings before you come in.

While there he learned painting and carpentry. He also participated in the band and performed for President Kennedy's inauguration. Tony joined the staff at ASU in 1962 as a painter and was a mason of the 32nd Degree. In keeping with Hopi tradition he was a member of the Flute Clan and participated in Hopi ceremonies and dances. Over the years he donated time and knowledge in an effort to preserve Hopi heritage. In 1978, he was a consultant on an exhibit of Hopi musical instruments at the Smithsonian Institution.

In 1193 B.C., Paris, Prince of Troy (Orlando Bloom), has fallen in love; however, the beautiful woman who has beguiled him is Helen, Queen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), who is wed to King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). While Helen is hardly immune to Paris' charms, this doesn't blunt Menelaus' fury when Paris steals her away from him. Menelaus' brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the power-hungry king of the Mycenaeans, is eager to expand his empire through Troy to the lands of the Aegean Sea, and he uses Paris' romantic slight against Menelaus as an excuse to wage an all-out war against the great walled city. Priam, King of Troy (Peter O'Toole), summons his armies, led by Prince Hector (Eric Bana), to meet the onslaught of Agamemnon's forces, but while the great city has yet to yield in a battle, Agamemnon has a formidable ally -- Achilles (Brad Pitt), a mighty and seemingly unstoppable warrior whose presence could tip the scales in Agamemnon's favor. Sean Bean, Julie Christie, Saffron Burrows, and Rose Byrne highlight the film's supporting cast.\n\ntroy,\"troy clip\",\"troy polamalu highlights\",\"troy polamalu\",\"brad pitt\",\"brian

It was here that, between the ages of twelve and fourteen, he trained to be a lithographer. Later he studied at the Teekenschool voor Kunstambachten (The School of Drawing for the Arts and Crafts), part of the Rijksakademie. In his early years De Roos was inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement. An example of this can be found in his edition of Kunst en Maatschappij (Art and Society (1903)). As a supporter of Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis, De Roos attempted to create the ideal of 'Art to the People'.\n \nBetween 1907 and 1947 he was employed by the Amsterdam Type foundry (known previously as N. Tetterode), where he further developed his lithographic skills. During this period he designed, a new type face, the Hollandsche Medi\u00e6val, the first Dutch made typeface for 150 years. In total De Roos designed twelve type faces, the most successful being the Hollandsche medi\u00e6val, the Egmont, the Libra and the De Roos Roman and Italic.\n \nArchive material, as well as the Tetterode Collection both attributed to De Roos, are available at the Library of the University of Amsterdam.

Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae are the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, families of the order include mammoths and mastodons. The largest living terrestrial animals, male African elephants can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes, particularly for grasping objects. In addition to their trunks, their incisors grow into tusks, which serve as tools for moving objects and digging and as weapons for fighting. The elephant's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of its body. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\nElephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance, and predators such as lions, tigers, hyenas and wild dogs usually target only the young elephants (or \"calves\"). Females (\"cows\") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch, often the oldest cow. Elephants have a fission-fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Males (\"bulls\") leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.\nAfrican elephants are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while the Asian elephant is classed as endangered. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past they were used in war; today, they are often put on display in zoos and circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature and popular culture.", "title": "Elephant Sound Effects", "publishedDate": "2014-01-14T15:29:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "-C7Fcg58rZU", "description": "Cop Out Movie Clip - watch all clips http://j.mp/z5Pkg6\nclick to subscribe http://j.mp/sNDUs5\n\nPaul (Tracy Morgan) loses his cool when he stops a very young car thief, Tommy (Marcus Morton).\n\nTM & \u00a9 Warner Bros.

Platt, Adam Siegel, Michael Tadross\nScreenwriter: Robb Cullen, Mark Cullen\nFilm Description: Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan team up for the Warner Bros. police buddy movie Cop Out in this Kevin Smith-directed production. From a script by Robb and Mark Cullen, the story centers around police detectives Jimmy (Willis), a no-B.S. divorced dad, and Paul (Morgan), a crazy-talking loose cannon. Despite nine years as partners, the two lawmen can still sometimes seem like polar opposites -- especially when Paul's unpredictable antics get them suspended without pay. Already strapped for cash and trying to pay for his daughter's wedding, Jimmy decides to sell a rare baseball card that's worth tens of thousands. Unfortunately, when the collector's shop is robbed and the card vanishes with the crook, Paul and Jimmy end up going rogue, tracking down the card and the drug ring behind its theft, all on their own time, and without any backup -- except for each other.\n\n\"cop out\",\"cop out clip\",\"cop out trailer\",\"cop out little kid scene\",\"cop out part 1\",\"cop out full movie\",\"cop out funny scenes\",\"bruce willis\",\"tracy morgan\",\"marcus morton\",\"kevin smith\",\"car videos\",\"action comedies\",comedy,\"late night comedies\",\"michael tadross\",\"marc e platt\",\"adam siegel\",\"polly johnsen\",\"mark cullen\",\"robb cullen\",\"control videos\",\"parking garage videos\",tommy,\"paul hodges\",\"jimmy monroe\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++482284,/m/0h7pj,/m/04tnqn", "title": "Cop Out #6 Movie CLIP - 10-Year-Old Thief (2010) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T22:01:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "-C7cGVG7208", "description": "Hope you enjoyed the video!

Maybe someone will be along that can explain it.\n\nBut, tomorrow I think I'll be on target again!\n...\nHopefully...\n:)\n\n\n(About 4 hours after I wrote the above.)\nI figured it out!\n\nI couldn't sleep thinking about why there is an at least a 4 inch difference at 400 yards. There had to be a reason, and I had to know that reason!\n\nBarrel twist!\n\nThat is what it is! Barrel twist!\n\n[deleted incorrect content]\n\nI always knew about the twist making the bullets trajectory head in a lateral direction, but I never seen any numbers on the subject or a detailed explanation; so I thought it was a negligible amount. It seems as if I was in error!\n\n[EDIT] As I am uploading the video, I am searching for info on bullet drift and twist rate. If I find some info I'll post a link to it.\nFound one! http://www.snipershide.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1257843\n(Example: A .308 Win shooting a 175 Sierra MK in a 1:12 barrel will experience about 8\" spin drift in 1000 yards; the same bullet will drift 12\" (a 50% increase) in a 1:10 barrel.)\nIt doesn't say which direction but I think I must be correct.\nhttp://www.appliedballisticsllc.com/index_files/SpinandCoriolisDrift.htm\n\"Bullets fired from right twist barrels drift to the right,\"\nI am correct but for the wrong reason. It makes better sense now. Much more drop, much more drift.\n\nI love missing targets! I learn so much!\n\nGuess what?\n\nAll my 600 yard shots were all right about the same amount, (around 6 to 8 inches from center.) I was kicking myself in the ass for not calculating the wind drift right.

Richard quit smoking by going cold turkey and focused on just getting through the few weeks of craving. \n\nAs a well-known NLP practitioner, Richard explains that if you want to quit, you have to deal with the craving by taking it one step at a time and counting down the days until the craving stops.

The Pope closed the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity with a prayer vigil in Rome's Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls.\nThe Church asks the faithful for more intense prayer for unity in the week of January 18 to 25, culminating on the feast of St Paul.\n\n\nPray to God that in the Holy Church, our Mother, the hearts of all may be one heart, as they were in the earliest times of Christianity; so that the words of Scripture may be truly fulfilled until the end of the ages: Multitudinis autem credentium erat cor unum et anima una \u2014 the company of the faithful were of one heart and one soul.\nI am saying this to you in all seriousness: may this holy unity not come to any harm through you. Take it to your prayer!\nThe Forge, 632\n\nGenuine ecumenism\nI venerate with all my strength the Rome of Peter and Paul, bathed in the blood of martyrs, the centre from which so many have set out to propagate throughout the world the saving word of Christ. To be Roman does not entail any manifestation of provincialism, but rather of authentic ecumenism. It presupposes the desire to enlarge the heart, to open it to all men with the redemptive zeal of Christ, who seeks all men and takes in all men, for he has loved all men first.\nIn Love with the Church, 11\n\nPlease say a prayer each day for the following intention: that all of us Catholics may be faithful and determined to struggle to be saints.\nIt is so obviously reasonable. What else are we to desire for those we love, for those who are bound to us by the strong ties of the faith?\nThe Forge, 925\n\nThe unity of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\nLet me begin by reminding you of something Saint Cyprian tells us: The universal Church is a people which derives its unity from the unity of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\nIn Love with the Church, 17\n\nThis pouring out of the Holy Spirit unites us to Christ and makes us acknowledge that we are children of God. The Paraclete, who is Love, teaches us to saturate our life with the virtue of charity. Thus consummati in unum: \"made one with Christ,\" we can be among men what the Eucharist is for us, in the words of St Augustine: \"a sign of unity, a bond of love.\"\nChrist is Passing By, 87\n\nIt is Jesus who speaks: 'Amen I say to you: ask and you shall receive; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.'\nPray. In what human venture could you have greater guarantees of success?\nThe Way, 96\n\nThe Communion of Saints\nYou will find it easier to do your duty if you think of how your brothers are helping you, and of the help you fail to give them if you are not faithful.\nThe Way, 549\n\nI thought the comment on loyalty you had written to me was very appropriate to all those moments in history which the devil makes his business to repeat. You said: \"I carry with me every day in my heart, in my mind and on my lips, an aspiration: Rome.\"\nFurrow, 344\n\nUnity and variety\nYou were amazed to hear me approve of the lack of 'uniformity' in that apostolate in which you work. And I told you: Unity and variety. You have to be different from one another, as the saints in heaven are different, each having their own personal and special characteristics. But also as alike one another as the saints, who would not be saints if they had not each identified themselves with Christ.\nThe Way, 947\n\nFaithfulness\nThe Church is apostolic by constitution. That which truly is and is called Catholic, should stand out at one and the same time by the prerogatives of unity, holiness and apostolic succession. In that way, the Church is one, with a clear and perfect unity of the whole world and all nations, with that unity of which the principle, root and indefectible origin is the supreme authority and most excellent primacy of blessed Peter, prince of the Apostles, and his successors in the Roman See. And there is no other Catholic Church, but that one which, built on the one Peter, rises up on the unity of the faith and on charity in one unique body, joined together and compact.\nWe help to make that apostolic continuity more evident in the eyes of all by demonstrating with exquisite fidelity our union with the Pope, which is union with Peter. Love for the Roman Pontiff must be in us a delightful passion, for in him we see Christ. If we speak with the Lord in prayer, we will go forward with a clear gaze that will permit us to perceive the action of the Holy Spirit, even in the face of events we do not understand or which produce sighs or sorrow.\nIn Love with the Church, 13\nhttp://www.josemariaescriva.info/article/christian-unity", "title": "Benedict XVI concludes the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity", "publishedDate": "2011-01-26T16:46:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-CRAtyEEJjM", "description": "Sedge Wren, Polk County, MN, 25 June 2014", "title": "Sedge Wren", "publishedDate": "2014-06-26T00:39:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "-CRCubTHSrk", "description": "tadjik girl singing beatiful", "title": "tadjik girl singing beatiful.mp4", "publishedDate": "2012-11-19T06:10:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "-CRJ_YLR2Ao", "description": "This video demonstrates a patient with missing upper molar and inadequate bone height due to sinus position.

As much as I love Toronto, I occasionally need to get out into the country and enjoy the beauty and serenity of Ontario's rural areas. So at 9 am I met my friend Karel who is a local expert of the area and we set off on a discovery of Halton Region Conservation areas: we started with Mount Nemo Conservation Area, stopped in Lowville, and then admired the Iroquois longhouses in Crawford Lake. After a brief stop in the Hilton Falls Conservation Area we explored the Victorian-era Main Street of Milton as well as its scenic Mill Pond.\n\nFrom here we drove on towards the Spencer Gorge Conservation Area where we enjoyed the view of two waterfalls: Tew's Falls and Webster's Falls. We also hiked out to Dundas Peak, and the rocky platform with its sheer vertical drops provided a stunning view of Dundas and the City of Hamilton. I capped off my country tour with a leisurely drive along Lake Ontario's shoreline past the cities of Burlington, Oakville and Mississauge.

She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect, which represents consciousness or discrimination, remains impotent and void. Goddess worship is an integral part of Hinduism.\nDevi is, quintessentially, the core form of every Hindu Goddess. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord, she is also called Prakriti, as she balances out the male aspect of the divine addressed Purusha.[2]\nDevi is the supreme Being in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, while in the Smartha tradition, she is one of the five primary forms of God.[3][4] In other Hindu traditions of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, Devi embodies the active energy and power of male deities (Purushas), such as Vishnu in Vaishnavism or Shiva in Shaivism. Vishnu's shakti counterpart is called Lakshmi, with Parvati being the female shakti of Shiva.\nDurga:  In the Hindu pantheon, Durga is one of the most popular goddesses, and her creation takes place in the context of a cosmic crisis. The asuras were on the ascent, and they had become a threat to cosmic stability. The male gods were unable to contain and subdue them. A number of male gods having failed to subdue the demons led by Mahishasura, assembled into a conclave and emitted their energies together which took the form of the warrior goddess, Durga, that is, the invincible.Saraswati::She is the goddess of speech and learning, and is the creator of Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas. She is the consort of Brahma, the creator and member of the Hindu Trinity. She is equally revered by Hindus, Jains and the Buddhists. Her iconography depicts her association with art, science and culture, which is dramatically different from some other major goddesses who are identified with fertility, wealth, and battles. She is shown as having four arms, and the most common items held by her in her hands are a book, a vina (lute), a mala, and a water pot. The book signified art, science and learning; the vina associates her with music and performing arts; and the prayer beads and water pot signify her association with religious rites. She is worshipped on the fifth day of the spring according to Hindu calendar, called the Basant Panchami.Shri-Lakshmi:...Shri, commonly known as Lakshmi and also called Shri Lakshmi, is one of the most popular and widely worshipped Devi in Hindu tradition since pre-Buddhist period. Her name is the basis for \"Lady Luck (Lakshmi)\" in the Christian West[citation needed]and her form of rising from water is depicted as Venus. She has a considerable body of mythology and history. The earliest legend states that Shri is born as a result of austerities of Prajapati, and she represents ten qualities and objects, namely, food, royal power, universal sovereignty, knowledge, power, holy luster, kingdom, fortune, bounteousness, and beauty.Kali:....Kali is one of the most significant divinities, and many texts and contexts treat Kali as an independent deity, not directly associated with a male god. In case she is associated with a male god, it is invariably Shiva. In this aspect, she represents the omnipotent Shakti of Shiva. She holds both the creative and destructive power of time.Navadurga::...Navadurga (Devanagari: \u0928\u0935\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e), which literally means nine Durgas, constitute, according to Hindu mythology, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. Navadurga are famously worshipped during the Autumn Navaratri or the Nine days, initiating the devotees into a period of festivities according to Hindu calendar.Mahavidya ::;...Mahavidyas, that is, the supreme knowledge, revelations and manifestations, refer to a group of ten goddesses. They constitute an important aspect of Mahadevi theology, which emphasizes that the Devi has a tendency to manifest and display herself in a variety of forms and aspects.Ten Mahavidyas are: Kali, Tara, Chinnamasta, Bhuvanesvari, Bagla, Dhumavati, Kamla, Matangi, Sodasi, and Bhairavi.\nParvati:...Parvati is the daughter of the mountains (the Himalayas), and manifests the aspect of the goddess as the wife of Shiva. She is generally considered a benign goddess.

This is an ethernet cable. This is a very short ethernet cable. This is a very long ethernet cable. They come in an assortment of colors. They are generally six feet long and this is the cable that connects your computer to your high speed internet. I say that it looks alot like a pregnant phone cord. It has the same shape and same plug as a phone cable would, only a phone cable has four wires and this has eight, so it is much wider. They are called CAT 5 cables or ethernet cables and sometimes the words CAT 5 will be printed on the cable itself. \n\nThe ethernet cable plugs in on the back generally of a desktop computer and sometimes it is part of the original computer pieces or the motherboard, what we call onboard and it would be this hole right here and you would just take the cable and plug it in. Sometimes there is a light that flashes when it is connected. Sometimes the ethernet connection is added later to the computer in the form of a card that is plugged into the computer. And then it would be more toward the bottom here. This computer actually has two ethernet connections, an onboard connection and an added on connection. \n\nHere again, all you would do is unplug the cord and plug it in like that. You push down on the little release to pull them out. Like that. If you have a laptop and you want to attach an ethernet cable to make it a wired internet connection, you would look on the side generally either left or right side of the laptop and again you see it here.

This area once served as a load area for the Magic Skyway - a gondola ride through the Matterhorn to Tomorrowland to Fantasyland, and reciprocally. The Skyway closed in 1994 due to its expensive maintenance; the entries into (and out of) the Matterhorn were sealed and the Tomorrowland station was erased from existence.

HAlf- SNAKE HALF- WOMAN !! 2014\nSnakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.\nLiving snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and on most smaller land masses \u2014 exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland and New Zealand, and many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific.[1] More than 20 families are currently recognized, comprising about 500 genera and about 3,400 species.[2][3] They range in size from the tiny, 10 cm-long thread snake to the Reticulated python of up to 8.7 meters (29 ft) in length.[4][5] The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 15 meters (49 ft) long. Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards during the mid-Cretaceous period, and the earliest known fossils date to around 112 Ma ago. The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene period (c 66 to 56 Ma ago). The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.\nMost species are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense. Some possess venom potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.Taxonomy\nAll modern snakes are grouped within the suborder Serpentes in Linnean taxonomy, part of the order Squamata, though their precise placement within squamates is controversial.[2]\nThe two infraorders of Serpentes are: Alethinophidia and Scolecophidia.[2] This separation is based on morphological characteristics and mitochondrial DNA sequence similarity. Alethinophidia is sometimes split into Henophidia and Caenophidia, with the latter consisting of \"colubroid\" snakes (colubrids, vipers, elapids, hydrophiids, and attractaspids) and acrochordids, while the other alethinophidian families comprise Henophidia.[19] While not extant today, the Madtsoiidae, a family of giant, primitive, python-like snakes, was around until 50,000 years ago in Australia, represented by genera such as Wonambi.\nThere are numerous debates in the systematics within the group. For instance, many sources classify Boidae and Pythonidae as one family, while some keep the Elapidae and Hydrophiidae (sea snakes) separate for practical reasons despite their extremely close relation.\nRecent molecular studies support the monophyly of the clades of modern snakes, scolecophidians, typhlopids + anomalepidids, alethinophidians, core alethinophidians, uropeltids (Cylindrophis, Anomochilus, uropeltines), macrostomatans, booids, boids, pythonids and caenophidians.[9]", "title": "Hybrid WOMAN Found in Brazil !!!

Another bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, can also be isolated from impetigo lesions sometimes. Impetigo begins as a cluster of small blisters that expand and rupture within the first twenty four hours. The thin yellow fluid that drains from the ruptured blisters dries forming a honey-colored crust. Impetigo develops most frequently on the legs, but may also be found on the arms, face and trunk. There is usually no fever.\nImpetigo may develop after the skin is infected with GABS. The bacterium is usually acquired from skin-to-skin contact with other person with impetigo. Impetigo may develop when open skin lesions, such as insect bites or burns, are infected following exposure to a person with streptococcal pharyngitis. The infection is most common in settings where there is crowding or activities leading to close person-to-person contact such as schools and military installations. Impetigo occurs more commonly during the summer and early fall.\nRarely, GABS may invade beyond the skin of a person with impetigo and cause more serious illnesses. Persons with impetigo may develop post-streptococcal scarlet fever, or glomerulonephritis, a condition that may result in temporary kidney failure. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis follows roughly ten days after the onset of streptococcal infection. However, the long-term prognosis is excellent. Scarlet fever is caused by a toxin produced by certain strains of GABS and is characterized by high fever, chills, sore throat, headache, vomiting and a fine red rash.\nSimple cleanliness and prompt attention to minor wounds will do much to prevent impetigo. Persons with impetigo or symptoms of GABS infections should seek medical care and if necessary begin antibiotic treatment as soon as possible to prevent spread to others. Individuals with impetigo should be excluded from school, day care, or other situations where close person-to-person contact is likely to occur until at least twenty four hours after beginning appropriate antibiotic therapy. Sharing of towels, clothing, and other personal articles should be discouraged.\nImpetigo may develop up to ten days after the skin becomes infected with GABS. A person with impetigo is probably no longer infectious after twenty four hours of adequate antibiotic treatment. Without treatment, a person may be infectious for several weeks. Impetigo may be treated with an antibiotic taken by mouth or by application of an antibiotic ointment to the affected areas. As is well known, chemical synthetic drugs have a very strong side effects and can cause canceration and malformation to the body, damage of physiological function, and even paralysis and death.\nWhile the ingredients of natural drugs are biological organics and essential materials that are useful and harmless to human selected and left by long-term practice. Natural drugs play an important role in treating difficult and complicated diseases such as virus diseases. Plant medicines are extracted and separated according to the main physicochemical property and material characteristics from roots, stems, flows, skins, leaves, or fruits of plants. Most of the plant medicines are targeted with insignificant toxicity and side effects, which are one of the main sources of clinical drugs.\nPlant medicine is composed of strictly certified organic medicinal plants used for the treatment of impetigo and is doctor recommended. The certified organic medicinal plant extracts in plant medicine exhibit the highest level of anti-bacterial activity against impetigo. Natural treatments are lipophilic and can be absorbed into your bloodstream easily. When treating impetigo make sure to use treatments made from certified organic medicinal plant extracts. They are free from toxic herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers.\nAs chemical drugs have certain side effect more or less, some present toxic side effect obviously and even can cause serious drug-induced diseases and drug resistance. It is thus clear that chemical drugs cause serious harm to the body at the time of dealing with diseases. The toxicity issue of chemical drugs is an increasing concern. Only use of certified organic ingredients guarantees your safety. Plant medicine eases the itching and eliminates impetigo, painlessly without scarring or tissue damage\n\nimpetigo natural remedies\nhome cures for impetigo\nhome cure for impetigo\nmedication for impetigo\nat home remedies for impetigo\nhome treatments for impetigo\nnatural remedies for impetigo", "title": "Plant Medicine for Impetigo Guarantees Your Safety", "publishedDate": "2013-08-24T16:26:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "-CvG0ICqymU", "description": "Is one really better than the other?", "title": "Arabians vs. Thoroughbreds", "publishedDate": "2007-12-08T22:32:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-CvT4lP9FyM", "description": "more BASS videos: http://www.youtube.com/user/basstheworldbyvideo - /// - Bass Demo of the Dunlop Cry Baby Bass Wah 105Q Pedal\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/basstheworldcom\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/basstheworldbyvideo\nhttp://instagram.com/basstheworld\nhttp://twitter.com/basstheworldcom", "title": "DUNLOP CRY BABY BASS WAH 105Q DEMO", "publishedDate": "2011-11-14T14:30:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Cva-FRYHek", "description": "Sally who lives in Wakefield would play for Arthur Poulter  a former Drayman at Timothy Taylor Brewery in Leeds who won the VC for gallantry after acting as a stretcher-bearer, on 10 occasions carrying badly wounded men on his back through particularly heavy artillery and machine-gun fire on 10 April 1918 at Erquinghem-Lys, France. \n\nWho would you play the Last Post for? \n\nwww.thelastpostproject.org.uk", "title": "Sally Russell Smith's Last Post tribute...", "publishedDate": "2014-08-19T13:58:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "-CvqWZz6j2E", "description": "BIS2014  WORLD FINALS IN CHINA FIND & LIKE US ON FACEBOOK :  https://www.facebook.com/FLIPEROFLAVATV BBOY SKIM JINJO CREW KOREA", "title": "BBOY SKIM (JINJO) @ BBOY IN SHANGHAI 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-04-30T09:57:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "-CwFn9F3ONU", "description": "Praying Mathis gets in position and grabs a Hummingbird.

It is part of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. Neighbouring provinces are Bangkok, to the north and west, and Chachoengsao to the east. Suvarnabhumi Airport (or also called New Bangkok International Airport) is located in the Bang Phli district of Samut Prakan province.\nThe province was created during the Ayutthaya period, with its administrative centre located at Phra Pradaeng. It was the sea port of Siam, and was secured with forts, town moats and town-walls. King Rama II starting the building of the new centre at Samut Prakan in 1819, after his predecessor King Taksin had disbanded the town fortification. Altogether six forts were built on both sides of the Chao Phraya river, and on an island in the river the pagoda Phra Samut Chedi was erected. These were involved in the Paknam incident of 13 July 1893, which ended the Franco-Siamese War with  the French naval blockade of Bangkok. Of the original six forts only two exist today, Phi Sua Samut and Phra Chulachomklao.\nIn Thai the word Samut is from Sanskrit, samudra, meaning ocean or sea, and the word Prakan is from Sanskrit, pr\u0101k\u0101ra, meaning fortress, walls or stronghold.\nThe provincial seal shows the temple Phra Samut Chedi, the most important site of Buddhist worship in the province. Provincial tree is Thespesia populnea. The provincial slogan is Marine Battle Fortresses, Chedi in the Water, Crocodile Farm, Exquisite Ancient City, Phra Pradaeng Songkran Festival, Tasty Dried Snakeskin Gourami, Rap Bua Festival, Industrial Estate.\nSamut Prakan is located at the mouth of the Chao Phraya river to the Gulf of Thailand. Thus the province is also sometimes called Pak Nam  the Thai word for the mouth of a river. The part of the province located on the western side of the river consist mostly of rice and prawn fields as well as mangrove forests, while the east part is the urban centre - including industrial factories. It is part of the Bangkok metropolis, the urbanization on both sides of the provincial boundary is identical. The province has a coastline of about 47.2 kilometres. Bang Pu Nature Reserve, about 12 km east of the town centre, has a large bird population. Especially during the winter the Sakdi pier at Bang Pu is very popular for Thai people feeding the wintering seagulls. The park is run jointly by the Royal Thai Army and the Thai WWF, and was officially established at the 72nd birthday of Queen Sirikit in 2004.", "title": "Samut Prakan Crocodile Farm and Zoo, Samut Prakan Province, Thailand  (21)", "publishedDate": "2013-11-11T06:11:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-CzIIB54hqI", "description": "", "title": "Drunk History: Mobutu Sese Seko", "publishedDate": "2010-05-18T06:14:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "-CzKQN3_ofM", "description": "", "title": "Zizania", "publishedDate": "2013-10-08T07:16:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-CzS8E5fI28", "description": "http://www.twitch.tv/wiiriketopray\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n----------Links----------\n\nSolo channels:\nChris' Channel - http://www.youtube.com/Chrescendo\nTyler's Channel - http://www.youtube.com/TylerDelynn\nTyson's Channel - http://www.youtube.com/Siber170\nSpencer's Channel - http://www.youtube.com/MrSuhSpence\n\nStay connected with us:\nLike our Facebook - http://www.facebook.com/WiiRikeToPray\nFollow us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/#!/WeRikeToPray\nFollow us on Twitch.tv - http://www.twitch.tv/wiiriketopray\nFollow us on Instagram - http://www.instagram.com/wiiriketopray", "title": "Cloudberry Kingdom Giveaway Winners!", "publishedDate": "2014-02-14T01:50:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "-CzW0aLXOrY", "description": "Roland Tim Srbija je svojim istrazivanjem dosao do resenja za dugo ocekivane terce na BK5 aranzeru.

The FACTS listed are followed by links to the source for validation. It is important that this notice is well understood before it is dispensed. Reading the information contained in the links will help accomplish that.\n \nWhen presenting this card to a corporate statute enforcer, be polite and courteous. Sign and date it in front of the statute enforcer and hand him/her the card. Never ever become belligerent with these corporate employees as many of them are nothing more than bullies! Say very little about the contents of the card other than to state that it is a notice of non-consent to be taken under advisement. In other words the card is a lawful notice and they need to talk to their attorneys prior to proceeding.\n \nRecommended verbiage:\n \u201cThis is a notice of non-consent \u2013 to be taken under advisement.\u201d\n Repeat if necessary.\n \nWhen asked by the statute enforcer if you \u201cunderstand\u201d, never say yes, because it is a trick question. They are instructed to get you to agree to \u201cstand under\u201d their authority and if you say yes, you are consenting to their authority and agree to abide by their corporate rules and/or regulations. In other words, you will have just verbally nullified your notice of non-consent. Also, if you are asked to sign \u2018paperwork\u2019, it is most likely not in your best interest. So, either refuse to sign or write \u201cunder duress\u201d above your signature and \u201cgave officer notice of non-consent\u201d under your signature.\n \nAfter reading the NOTICE and the accompanying information, it will become more apparent that the pocket card NOTICE of non-consent can be written without reference to vaccines and used for other encounters with statute enforcers.\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOTICE!\n \nThis is a notice of non-consent\n \nFACTS:\n 1. Laws passed by the STATE OF, COUNTY & MUNICIPAL corporations are for (non-human) legal \u201cpersons\u201d . . . not for flesh and blood men and women \u2013 unless we consent or agree to contract.\n Resource:\n Cornell University Law School\u2019s Legal Information Institute defines a person as follows:\n \u201cLegal person refers to a non-human entity that is treated as a person for limited legal purposes\u2013corporations, for example.\u201d\n \n2. Executive Orders written by the President of the corporate UNITED STATES only have authority over the UNITED STATES corporation (and its agency network) located in the 10 mile square of Washington, D.C. \u2013 unless we consent or agree to contract.\n Resource:\n https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-orders\n \n3. No agency of the corporate government network can be \u201cgranted\u201d the authority to deprive living men and women of their human unalienable rights \u2013 without our written consent or willingness to contract!\n Resources:\n The Legal Process by Judge Dale, retired \u2013 Pg 5\n Bond vs. UNITED STATES \u2013 #6 and #7\n Clearfield Doctrine\n \n4. Enforcement of corporate statutes, rules, regulations or Executive Orders by law enforcement officers \u2013 without full disclosure and written consent \u2013 are unlawful and these officers can be held personally liable for their actions. [Supreme Court: Bond v. UNITED STATES 529 US 334 (2000)]\n Resources:\n Bond vs. UNITED STATES \u2013 #8\n Clearfield Doctrine\n \n5. Those who produce vaccines have been given immunity from liability should their products cause illness or injury. [Supreme Court decision: Bruesewitz v. Wyeth (2011)] The manufacturers no longer warrant them as either safe or effective. Therefore, if vaccines are forced onto men or women \u2013 without their written consent \u2013 the enforcement \u2018officer\u2019 will be personally liable for any illness or injury the vaccine may cause.\n Resources:\n Supreme Court decision: Bruesewitz v. Wyeth (2011)\n Bond vs. UNITED STATES \u2013 #8\n \nVoid for Vagueness Doctrine\n \u201d . . . a vague law is a violation of due process because the law does not provide fair warning of a prohibition and fails to set standards for enforcement that would govern the exercise of the police power.\u201d\n Resource: http://dictionary.findlaw.com/definition/void-for-vagueness-doctrine.html\n \nI do not consent to your request.

In their technology block, they experienced all of the work that has to be done to process their drawings from paper to a 3D world. But that's not all! They also helped write a 30-minute extension of the short story as part of a creative writing assignment. Students acted in front of a green screen, created their own costumes, and recorded vocals on two new songs written by David Stoeri! To see a trailer for the movie, click here.

But Gideon Fletcher dreams of a different future. He sets out to travel the world, leaving his life and his love behind. When Gideon returns home 15 years later, he finds the shipyard's future in grave danger and his childhood sweetheart engaged to someone else. As the men of Wallsend take their future into their own hands and build a towering representation of the shared dream that defines their existence, Gideon realizes that he left behind more than he could have ever imagined.\n\nTHE LAST SHIP is a portrait of a community so bound together by passion, faith and tradition, they'll stop at nothing to preserve the only life they've ever known.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LastShipMusical\nhttps://twitter.com/LastShipMusical", "title": "Sting\u2019s THE LAST SHIP Now on Broadway", "publishedDate": "2014-09-29T14:28:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "-DHmscUPeTE", "description": "", "title": "Divina Artemisia", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T14:27:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "-DHzhmqalMQ", "description": "Veronica LaFranchi of Ticino Tourism, talks about this Swiss region's Mediterranean climate, high mountains and spectacular lakes.

The centre helps breed and rehabilitate Crocodiles and Gharials in the Chambal. The river boasts of a population of over 200 Crocodiles and 1600 Gharials. Active efforts are now to\nprotect the Ganges River Dolphins. \n\nThe gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) is a crocodilian of the family Gavialidae that is native to the Indian subcontinent and also called gavial and fish-eating crocodile. As the species has undergone both chronic long term and a rapid short-term declines it is listed as a Critically Endangered by IUCN. The gharial is one of three crocodilians native to India, apart from the mugger crocodile and the saltwater crocodile. It is one of the longest of all living crocodilians. Gharials once thrived in all the major river systems of the Indian subcontinent, spanning the rivers of its northern part from the Indus River in Pakistan across the Gangetic floodplain to the Irrawaddy River in Myanmar. Today, they are extinct in the Indus River, in the Brahmaputra of Bhutan and Bangladesh and in the Irrawaddy River. Their distribution is now limited to only 2% of their former range. \n\nNational Chambal Sanctuary, also called the National Chambal Gharial Wildlife Sanctuary, is a 5,400 km2 (2,100 sq mi) tri-state protected area in northern India for the critically endangered gharial (small crocodiles), the red-crowned roof turtle and the endangered Ganges river dolphin. Located on the Chambal River near the tripoint of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, it was first declared in Madhya Pradesh in 1978 and now constitutes a long narrow eco-reserve co-administered by the three states. Within the sanctuary the pristine Chambal River cuts through mazes of ravines and hills with many sandy beaches. The sanctuary is protected under India's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The sanctuary is administered by the Department of Forest under the Project Officer with headquarters at Morena, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe Critically endangered Gharial crocodile and the Red-crowned roof turtle live here, and together with the endangered Ganges River Dolphin are the keystone species of the sanctuary. Other large threatened inhabitants of the sanctuary include Muggar crocodile, Smooth-coated Otter, Striped Hyaena and Indian Wolf. Chambal supports 8 of the 26 rare turtle species found in India, including Indian narrow-headed softshell turtle, Three-striped roof turtle and Crowned river turtle. Other reptiles who live here are: Indian flapshell turtle, Soft Shell turtle, Indian roofed turtle, Indian tent turtle and Monitor lizard.\n\nThere are many nature watching opportunities available for the visitors to the National Chambal Sanctuary. The best opportunities for sighting and photography of Gharial and Dolphins can be had by hiring a boat with experienced driver and guide, available at several points along the river. A boat excursion will also offer many good viewpoints for photography of water and shore birds and unique landscapes. Walking trails in the ravines and along the river offer opportunities for close observation of the wide variety of plants and animals in the Sanctuary. There are public vehicle entry points to Chambal Sanctuary at Pinahat, Nandagon Ghat, Sehson and Bharch. Boating and visiting arrangements can be made with the help of the Wildlife Conservator Office, at Kota.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

I think Claire Danes would make a great Clea, but I didn't really have any ideas for working her into the trailer. \n\nMusic:\nRammstein -- Mein Herz Brent (Instrumental)\nBrand X Music -- Dogs of War\nBrand X Music -- One Man Remains\n\nClips: No One Lives, Dracula Untold, Priest, The Seeker: Dark is Rising, Immortals, Ip Man 2, The Last Samurai, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, Flashpoint, RED, Fast and Furious 6, The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug, The Darkest Hour, I Am Number Four, The Mortal Instruments, Jumper, Unknown, The Walking Dead, Kill Zone, Hellboy, X-Men, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, Deliver Us From Evil. \nVoice Overs: Doctor Strange (2007), Hellboy II: The Golden Army (Trailer) & Inception.\n\nNo copyright infringement intended, all rights to their respective owners.", "title": "Doctor Strange (Trailer)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-06T00:13:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "-DVrG_AjlVY", "description": "song for moriah", "title": "CheeseCake - shavuot", "publishedDate": "2008-06-07T19:23:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-DVtWhtetWc", "description": "Watch Greg Carpenter, CEO, talk about Employee Fiduciary's clients and why they choose to work with us.", "title": "Who chooses to work with Employee Fiduciary and why", "publishedDate": "2013-06-27T04:52:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "-DWQOumifMg", "description": "The 21st Theater Sustainment Command, 18th Military Police Brigade, 95th Military Police Battalion cases their colors during an inactivation ceremony on June 10, 2014 in Germany.", "title": "95th Military Police Battalion Inactivation Ceremony", "publishedDate": "2014-06-12T08:57:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "-DWabmpzbZ0", "description": "~i took, i took your memories //\n\n[BUY]\n\nTrackitdown: http://www.trackitdown.net/genre/drum_and_bass/track/3585020.html\n\niTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/epiphany-feat.-veela-feint/id462184918\n\nDrum&Bass Arena: \nhttp://download.breakbeat.co.uk/lpsepsartists/twothirdsfeint/epiphany.aspx\n\nJuno: http://www.junodownload.com/products/epiphany/1824167-02/\n\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Epiphany/dp/B005KRF8W8/ref=pd_rhf_p_t_1\n\nNu-Urbanmusic: http://www.nu-urbanmusic.co.uk/drum_and_bass/shop/product_info.php?products_id=22609\n\n[FACEBOOK]\n~http://www.facebook.com/feintDnB\n~http://www.facebook.com/TwoThirdsDnB\n~http://www.facebook.com/veelabeats\n\n[TWOTHIRDS, VEELA]\n~http://www.youtube.com/user/dranner123\n~http://www.youtube.com/veelabeats\n\n[ARTWORK]\n~artwork by Joe (MatchingOpposites):\n~facebook: http://www.facebook.com/jbaggerzz\n~website: http://matchingopposites.wordpress.com/\n~youtube: http://www.youtube.com/freerideproductions\n\nx", "title": "TwoThirds & Feint - Epiphany (feat.

Commodities refer to primary goods such as wheat, gold or oil, and are traded on dedicated exchanges around the world. They are often influential components of the financial markets, so understanding how they are priced, and how they are traded, is extremely important.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubscribe to IG Australia - http://bit.ly/SubIGAustralia\nWatch more introductory videos - http://bit.ly/IGGetStartedPlaylist\nTry our Demo Platform - http://bit.ly/IG-Demo-Trading\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWikipedia: \n\nA commodity market is a market that trades in primary rather than manufactured products. Soft commodities are agricultural products such as wheat, coffee, cocoa and sugar. Hard commodities are mined, such as gold, rubber and oil. Investors access about 50 major commodity markets worldwide with purely financial transactions increasingly outnumbering physical trades in which goods are delivered. Futures contracts are the oldest way of investing in commodities. Futures are secured by physical assets. Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options on futures. Farmers have used a simple form of derivative trading in the commodity market for centuries for price risk management.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe comments in this video do not contain (and should not be construed as containing) financial product advice or an investment recommendation, or, an offer of or solicitation for, a transaction in any financial instrument.

It is considered the premier competition in alpine ski racing together with the quadrennial Olympic Winter Games and the biennial FIS Alpine World Ski Championships. Some experts event consider winning the World Cup to be athletically a more valuable title than winning gold at the Olympic Winter Games or the World Championships, since it requires a competitor to ski at an extremely high level in several events throughout the season, and not just in one race. Today, the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup races are held primarily at famous ski resorts in the European Alps, along with regular stops in Scandinavia, North America, and Far East Asia. Competitors attempt to score a maximum of points during the season in five events: slalom, giant slalom, super-G, downhill and super combined. The fifth event, super-combined, was introduced in 2005 and generally consists of a shorter downhill race and a one-run slalom. Sometimes the downhill is replaced by a super-G.  Alpine was added to the Olympic winter schedule in 1936.\n\nFor further information about FIS Alpine visit: \n http://www.fis-ski.com/alpine-skiing/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fisalpine\n\nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/fisalpine", "title": "Maze back on winning ways in Levi | Audi FIS Ski World Cup Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-11-15T14:18:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-DjGzFw0Du0", "description": "", "title": "The Wiggles Dorothy", "publishedDate": "2009-03-18T21:53:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "-DjXOo6OMpc", "description": "La Roche-Posay Physiological Ultra Fine Scrub Product Review\nhttp://bit.ly/PTpKHK\n\nSave 20% with coupon code: SHOPNOW\nShop Online, Free Shipping + 45 Day Returns. \n\nThe La Roche-Posay Physiological Ultra-Fine Scrub is a cleansing scrub with optimal safety on sensitive skin.

I teach photography at the School of Visual Arts in New York.  \n\nIf you're going to shoot a selfie, don't use a big camera like this.  You're asking to use it as a gravity checker if you try to hold it up in the air with one hand like that.  Even if you can hold it, you can't hold it steady enough to keep the motion of your own hands from making your picture blurry.  \n\nYou use your point and shoot camera and you hold it above your eye line a bit.  Everybody looks better when you point it down on them a little bit.  Get the lens lined up.  Bring your chin down very slightly.  And hit the button.  \n\nDon't be afraid to take a lot of pictures because it's very hard to line the camera up this way when you can't look through the view finder.  \n\nDon't be afraid to work through a few angles and even better, if you're using a real camera, you can shoot verticals.  People are vertical.\n\nDon't try to tip your chin up all the way where the camera is.  The point is to keep it a little bit above your eye line.  \n\nUsually you set the lens a little bit on the wide side so if you're off one way or another, you're not cropping out half of your head or your ears or something like that.\n\nIf you're using your phone to take your selfie and you're looking the mirror, don't look at the screen on the phone.  Once you get the thing framed up, look at yourself in the mirror and then hit the button on the phone so that the picture happens then.\n\nAnd those are some tips on taking selfies.", "title": "How to Take a Self-Portrait | Portrait Photography", "publishedDate": "2013-12-13T08:14:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-DuPCNSbnno", "description": "Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\nSubscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\nLike us on FACEBOOK: http://goo.gl/dHs73\nFollow us on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/1ghOWmt\nThe Interview Movie CLIP - Zac Efron Reveals All (2014) - James Franco Movie HD\n\nRelease Date: 12/25/14\n\nTalk-show host Dave Skylark and his producer, Aaron Rapoport, score an interview with Kim Jong-Un, dictator of North Korea.

His native town is Tulambah near Mian Channu. His father belonged to the Muslim Rajputs community , was an agriculturist and was a respected person in his field and the local area.Tariq Jameel was born and raised in Mian Channu and is the son of a feudal agriculturist also referred to as \"Mian\" in Pakistan. In his childhood he lived a relatively modest life but religion was not a major part of his life and his family in particular. It wasn't until he pursued his M.B.B.S. in Lahore that his focus shifted towards Islam. After completing his Higher Secondary School education (a.k.a F.Sc in some regions of Pakistan) in pre-medical (equivalent to A 'levels') from Government College University Lahore, he took admission in King Edward Medical College in Lahore. He intended to do his M.B.B.S., but his leanings towards spirituality soon urged him to switch to Islamic education. He then went on to receive Islamic education from Jamia Arabia, Raiwind (near Lahore), Pakistan where he studied Quran, Hadith, Sharia, Tasawwuf, logic and Fiqh. His proclivity towards Islam grew during hostel life in Lahore and can mainly be attributed to the group members of Tablighi Jamaat who he became friends with during his college life. He regularly delivers lectures and speeches encouraging people to follow Islamic values and principles and put them into practice in their everyday life. He emphasizes a non-political, non-violent, non-sectarian Islam. Due to his sermons, Tariq Jameel commands respect from Muslims all over the world. He has a simple style of explaining the purpose of human life and its creation and often uses scientific examples to support his argument. He has delivered lectures to all types of communities in the society with the attendees being doctors, engineers, professors, businessmen, landlords, government officials, TV/film artists, ministers/politicians and sports celebrities. His untiring efforts brought real Islamic values in the lives of some of the greatest Pakistani cricketing legends such as Saeed Anwar, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Yousuf, Saqlain Mushtaq, Mushtaq Ahmedand Saleem Malik. He has also been the main paradigm for Junaid Jamshed since his volte-face towards Islam. Tariq Jameel is also a student of the late Mufti Yousuf Ludhianvi another renowned scholar. Tariq Jameel's lectures incorporate a wide range of issues of Islam and social concern. He especially emphasizes on self-purification, avoidance of violent ways, observance of Allah' orders and to follow the Prophet Muhammad's sunnah. He is a staunch critic of moral degeneration, indecent practices and shamelessness that have established its stronghold among young generation of Muslims.\n                 By   Muhammad Akmal  +92 333 686111", "title": "Mulana Tariq Jameel  Governor Sindh Dr. Ishrat ul Ebad  Akmal_ufone", "publishedDate": "2011-12-12T19:17:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "-E2YcZuQozc", "description": "http://www.louisfilm.com/incapacity.html\nTeaser trailer for an independent feature...", "title": "Incapacity Teaser Trailer", "publishedDate": "2007-05-14T09:45:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "-E2a_TMiRAA", "description": "A hot pink star can be produced from potassium perchlorate, copper sorbate, strontium carbonate and parlon.

Dr. Bickford discusses a study published in a peer-reviewed journal that shows how spirulina prevents the loss of neurons in the brain associated with movement disorders in Parkinson's. \n\nSpirulina is a cyanobacteria found in pristine freshwater lakes, rivers and ponds and is often referred to as nature's most complete superfood. It offers health benefits to practically every organ in the human body. It helps promote cell regeneration meaning wounds heal more quickly and faster recovery from illnesses. However, as an immune system booster, illnesses are less likely to be contracted while taking a quality spirulina supplement such as Hawaiian Spirulina.\n\nFor spirulina products and information, visit http://www.nutrex-hawaii.com/hawaiian-spirulina-pacifica\n\nView more Nutrex Hawaii Videos: http://www.youtube.com/user/NutrexHawaii \nLike Nutrex Hawaii on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/nutrexhawaii\nFollow Nutrex Hawaii on Twitter: https://twitter.com/SuperNutrient\nFollow Nutrex Hawaii on Pinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/nutrexhawaii/\nFollow Nutrex Hawaii on Instagram:\nhttp://instagram.com/nutrexhawaii\nFollow Nutrex Hawaii on Google +: https://plus.google.com/+Nutrexhawaiisupernutrients", "title": "Hawaiian Spirulina & Brain Health with Neurologist, Paula Bickford | Nutrex Hawaii", "publishedDate": "2012-12-12T23:54:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-E4d0wiX9RM", "description": "red\u00e9couvrez un race de chien devenue rare!", "title": "les bouviers des Ardennes du Maugr\u00e9", "publishedDate": "2011-01-07T21:37:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-E4rPlkan1g", "description": "Michael Vogt vs Andy Padda MMA WARPATH, March 8th 2013.", "title": "Michael Vogt vs. Andy Padda", "publishedDate": "2013-03-09T19:02:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "-E5jpgo-D2Q", "description": "I bought a Baby Bean Bag prop for my photography business and while with my friend Tracey, she told the most hilarious story about filling her bean bag.

Amid this barnyard melody, the papal vicar of Vatican City blessed these Roman citizens, marking the feast of St. Anthony the Abbot. \n\nA stable in front of the Vatican may be an odd site, but Jan. 17 is a day to remind Catholics of God's earthly masterpieces. \n\nAt noontime, a menagerie of buffalo, pheasants, horses, sheep, donkeys and even roosters took center stage in St. Peter's Square to commemorate the patron saint of animals, basketweavers and even grave diggers. \n\n\"It's a beautiful tradition. He became the patron saint of domestic animals during the Middle Ages.\" \n\nThe event was organized by the Italian association of farmers and ranchers, whose patron saint St. Anthony, died in Egypt in 356. \n\nThis breeder brought his horses, not just to make them gallop faster, but for a religious purpose. \n\n\"It's symbolic. It protects the animals.\" \n\nCardinal Angelo Comastri celebrated a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica with most of the members of the association, while many waited with their livestock in the square. \n\nItalian police, as well as delegations from towns outside of Rome, rode in on horses to receive the cardinal's blessing. \n\nThe smell was less than flowery, but these little pilgrims certainly didn't mind seeing their favorite animals in the heart of the city. \nAnthony the Great or Antony the Great (c. 251--356), (Coptic \u2c80\u2c83\u2c83\u2c81 \u2c80\u2c9b\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2c9b\u2c93), also known as Saint Anthony, Anthony the Abbot, Anthony of Egypt, Anthony of the Desert, Anthony the Anchorite, Abba Antonius (\u1f08\u03b2\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c2 \u1f08\u03bd\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2), and Father of All Monks, was a Christian saint from Egypt, a prominent leader among the Desert Fathers. He is celebrated in many churches on his feast days: 17 January in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Western churches; and Tobi 22, (January 30) in the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Coptic Catholic Church.\nThe biography of Anthony's life by Athanasius of Alexandria helped to spread the concept of monasticism, particularly in Western Europe through Latin translations. He is often erroneously considered the first monk, but as his biography and other sources make clear, there were many ascetics before him. Anthony was, however, the first known ascetic going into the wilderness, a geographical shift that seems to have contributed to his renown.[4]\nAnthony is appealed to against infectious diseases, particularly skin diseases. \"Saint Anthony's fire\" has described different afflictions including ergotism, erysipelas and shingles.\nAnthony was born in Cooma near Herakleopolis Magna in Lower Egypt in 251 to wealthy landowner parents. When he was about 18 years old, his parents died and left him with the care of his unmarried sister.\nThere are various legends associating him with pigs: one is that for a time he worked as a swineherd.[1][2][3]\nIn 285, at the age of 34, he decided to follow the words of Jesus, who had said: \"If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasures in heaven; and come, follow Me.\",[6] which is part of the Evangelical counsels. Taking these words quite literally, Anthony gave away some of the family estate to his neighbors, sold the remaining property, donated the funds thus raised to the poor, placed his sister with a group of Christian virgins,[7] a sort of proto-nunnery at the time, and himself became the disciple of a local hermit.[8]\nThe appellation \"Father of Monasticism\" is misleading, as Christian monasticism was already being practiced in the deserts of Egypt. Ascetics commonly retired to isolated locations on the outskirts of cities. Anthony is notable for being one of the first ascetics to attempt living in the desert proper, completely cut off from civilization. His anchoretic lifestyle was remarkably harsher than that of his predecessors. By the 2nd century there were also famous Christian ascetics, such as Saint Thecla. Saint Anthony decided to follow this tradition and headed out into the alkaline desert region called Nitria in Latin (Wadi El Natrun today), about 95 km (59 mi) west of Alexandria, some of the most rugged terrain of the Western Desert. Here he remained for some 13 years.[8]\nAlso note that the Therapeutae, pagan ascetic hermits and loosely organized cenobitic communities described by the Hellenized Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria in the first century, were long established in the harsh environments by the Lake Mareotis close to Alexandria, and in other less-accessible regions. Philo understood that for \"this class of persons may be met with in many places, for both Greece and barbarian countries want to enjoy whatever is perfectly good.\"", "title": "Farmyard blessings in St. Peter's Square of Rome", "publishedDate": "2011-01-19T03:00:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "-E7X3ydPRgg", "description": "Had a great day at Old Moor RSPB, we were fortunate to see the mass migration of the Golden plover, at times there were so many the sky was black !", "title": "Mass migration of the  Golden plover.(Pluvialis Apricaria ) UK.", "publishedDate": "2011-11-22T19:15:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "-E7ZdV5iskw", "description": "This video was uploaded from an Android phone.", "title": "Yo!!!

PSK contains 34-35% polysaccharide (~92% glucan) and 28-35% protein10.\n\nPSK has been shown to boost immune cell production, ameliorate chemotherapy and radiotherapy side effects, enhance immune status and tumour infiltration by dendritic and cytotoxic cells and significantly extend survival in cancers of the stomach, colon-rectum, oesophagus, nasopharynx, uterus and lung (non-small cell types), and in an HLA B40-positive breast cancer subset in combination with conventional treatment1. In addition to its immune related effects, PSK has shown an ability to enhance superoxidedismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity11,12.\n\nPSP has been shown to significantly enhance immune status in 70-97% of patients with cancer of the stomach, oesophagus, lung, ovary and cervix8.\n\nAlthough most clinical trials have been conducted with the above proteoglycan extracts, there is also evidence of immunomodulatory action for T. versicolor biomass, with improvements of immune status in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and enhanced clearance of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) from the cervix.\n\n\nNous avons fait une double extraction avec elles pour faire une m\u00e9decine facilement accessible .. essentiellement i briser les champignons, autant que possible,reduire en poudre puis les mettre dans un bocal et couvrir avec 50/50 eau / grain alchohol, vous pouvez \u00e9galement utiliser la vodka qui est essentiellement 50% eau de toute fa\u00e7on ...

An ancient road also ran hence to Nursia. The Ponte Sanguinario of the first century BCE still exists. The Forum lies under today's marketplace.\n\nLocated at the head of a large, broad valley, surrounded by mountains, Spoleto has long occupied a strategic geographical position. It appears to have been an important town to the original Umbri tribes, who built walls around their settlement in the 5th century BC, some of which are visible today.\n\nThe first historical mention of Spoletium is the notice of the foundation of a colony there in 241 BC;[1] and it was still, according to Cicero[2] colonia latina in primis firma et illustris: a Latin colony in 95 BC. After the Battle of Lake Trasimene (217 BC) Spoletium was attacked by Hannibal, who was repulsed by the inhabitants[3] During the Second Punic War the city was a useful ally to Rome. It suffered greatly during the civil wars of Gaius Marius and Sulla. The latter, after his victory over Crassus, confiscated the territory of Spoletium (82 BC). From this time forth it was a municipium.\n\nUnder the empire it seems to have flourished once again, but is not often mentioned in history. Martial speaks of its wine. Aemilianus, who had been proclaimed emperor by his soldiers in Moesia, was slain by them here on his way from Rome (253), after a reign of three or four months. Rescripts of Constantine (326) and Julian (362) are dated from Spoleto. The foundation of the episcopal see dates from the 4th century: early martyrs of Spoleto are legends, but a letter to the bishop Caecilianus, from Pope Liberius in 354 constitutes its first historical mention. Owing to its elevated position Spoleto was an important stronghold during the Vandal and Gothic wars; its walls were dismantled by Totila.[4]\nMain article: Duchy of Spoleto\n\nUnder the Lombards, Spoleto became the capital of an independent duchy, the Duchy of Spoleto (from 570), and its dukes ruled a considerable part of central Italy. In 774 it became part of Holy Roman Empire. Together with other fiefs, it was bequeathed to Pope Gregory VII by the powerful countess Matilda of Tuscany, but for some time struggled to maintain its independence. In 1155 it was destroyed by Frederick Barbarossa. In 1213 it was definitively occupied by Pope Gregory IX. During the absence of the papal court in Avignon, it was prey to the struggles between Guelphs and Ghibellines, until in 1354 Cardinal Albornoz brought it once more under the authority of the Papal States.\nView of Spoleto.\n\nAfter Napoleon's conquest of Italy, in 1809 Spoleto became capital of the short-lived French department of Trasim\u00e8ne, returning to the Papal States after Napoleon's defeat, within five years. In 1860, after a gallant defence, Spoleto was taken by the troops fighting for the unification of Italy. Giovanni Pontano, founder of the Accademia Pontaniana of Naples, was born here. Another child of Spoleto was Francis Possenti who was educated in the Jesuit school and whose father was the Papal assesor, Francis later entered the Passionists and became Saint Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows.

Hard anodizing is 3 times thicker than standard anodizing and is as hard as a piece of heat-treated tool steel (RC 60-65). This finish will help to eliminate both scratching and wear. All steel parts are heat treated with a black oxide finish. The barrel is made from either heat treated 416 Stainless Steel or heat treated 4140 steel, depending upon availability. \n\nTHE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION \nInstallation is simple and does not require any modifications to your Glock pistol. Simply remove the Glock magazine and slide as outlined in your Glock owner's manual. Now slide the Advantage Arms slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock.

It is named after the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus (Ancient Greek: \u039f\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2) the father of Cronus (Saturn) and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter). Though it is visible to the naked eye like the five classical planets, it was never recognized as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit. Sir William Herschel announced its discovery on March 13, 1781, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time in modern history. Uranus was also the first planet discovered with a telescope. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different compositions from those of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. As such, astronomers sometimes place them in a separate category, the \"ice giants\". Uranus's atmosphere, while similar to Jupiter and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, contains more \"ices\" such as water, ammonia and methane, along with traces of hydrocarbons. It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (224 \u00b0C). It has a complex, layered cloud structure, with water thought to make up the lowest clouds, and methane thought to make up the uppermost layer of clouds. In contrast the interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock. Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration among the planets because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its revolution about the Sun. As such, its north and south poles lie where most other planets have their equators. Seen from Earth, Uranus's rings can sometimes appear to circle the planet like an archery target and its moons revolve around it like the hands of a clock, though in 2007 and 2008 the rings appeared edge-on. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as a virtually featureless planet in visible light without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giants. However, terrestrial observers have seen signs of seasonal change and increased weather activity in recent years as Uranus approached its equinox. The wind speeds on Uranus can reach 250 meters per second (900 km/h, 560 mph).\n\nDiscovered by William Herschel  March 13, 1781 \nPronunciation /\u02c8j\u028a\u0259r\u0259n\u0259s/  ( listen) or /j\u028a\u02c8re\u026an\u0259s\nAdjective Uranian \nOrbital characteristics \nEpoch J2000 \nAphelion 3,004,419,704 km (20.083 305 26 AU)\nPerihelion 2,748,938,461 km (18.375 518 63 AU) \nSemi-major axis 2,876,679,082 km (19.229 411 95 AU) \nEccentricity 0.044 405 586 \nOrbital period 30,799.095 days 84.323 326 yr\n42,718 Uranus solar days \nSynodic period 369.66 days\nAverage orbital speed 6.81 km/s \nMean anomaly 142.955 717\u00b0 \nInclination 0.772 556\u00b0 to Ecliptic\n6.48\u00b0 to Sun's equator\n1.02\u00b0 to Invariable plane \nLongitude of ascending node 73.989 821\u00b0 \nArgument of perihelion 96.541 318\u00b0 \nSatellites 27 \nPhysical characteristics \nEquatorial radius 25,559 \u00b1 4 km (4.007 Earths)\nPolar radius 24,973 \u00b1 20 km (3.929 Earths) \nFlattening 0.022 9 \u00b1 0.000 8\nSurface area 8.115 6 \u00d7 109 km\u00b2 (15.91 Earths) \nVolume 6.833 \u00d7 1013 km\u00b3 (63.086 Earths) \nMass (8.6810 \u00b1 0.0013) \u00d7 1025 kg (14.536 Earths)\nGM=5 793 939 \u00b1 13 km\u00b3/s\u00b2 \nMean density 1.27 g/cm\u00b3 \nEquatorial surface gravity 8.69 m/s\u00b2 0.886 g \nEscape velocity 21.3 km/s\nSidereal rotation period 0.718 33 day\n17 h 14 min 24 s\nEquatorial rotation velocity 2.59 km/s 9,320 km/h \nAxial tilt 97.77\u00b0\nNorth pole right ascension 17 h 9 min 15 s\n257.311\u00b0\nNorth pole declination 15.175\u00b0\nAlbedo 0.300 (bond)\n0.51 (geom.)\nSurface temp. min  mean  max \n   1 bar level            76 K\n   0.1 bar        49 K  53 K  57 K \n(tropopause) \nApparent magnitude 5.9[10] to 5.32\nAngular diameter 3.3\"4.1\" \nAtmosphere \nScale height 27.7 km\nComposition (Below 1.3 bar) 83 \u00b1 3% Hydrogen (H2) \n15 \u00b1 3% Helium, 2.3% Methane, 0.009%\n(0.0070.015%) Hydrogen deuteride (HD)\n Ices:  \n Ammonia,  water,  ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) \n methane (CH4)", "title": "Uranus Exploration", "publishedDate": "2009-01-02T14:02:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ElhxDdlkuk", "description": "Re did this one in standard tuning on acoustic.

We think they look fantastic and our customers and consumers should begin to see them appear on the shelves of supermarkets, off licences and pubs by early May. \n\n\"The first thing you will notice is the shape. We have changed to a sleeker, taller-looking design, although it is actually only 1mm taller than the old bottle. The label has been placed higher up to ensure that the brand stands head and shoulders above our competitors. The bottle also includes an embossed outline of the River Thames, the majestic heartbeat of London, on the banks of which our beers are crafted. We took some of our cues from the world of wine, so we think the new bottle is equally at home on the dining table as it is on the bar.\n\n\"The decision to change the existing bottle was not taken lightly, as it had done a fantastic job for us in its current guise for around 20 years. However, with single bottle purchases the largest sales format in the off-trade, stand-out on shelf has become critically important.\n\n\"To that end, we have also taken the opportunity to refresh the London Pride label, with a more modern look which will eventually translate into other pack formats, including draught. The London Pride badge is instantly recognisable to beer drinkers around the world so this new evolution retains all of the most important elements, including the shape of the shield. \n\n\"New labels have also been created for our entire portfolio of Premium Bottled Ales so look out for the new-look Fuller's bottle range in the coming months.\"\n\nENDS\n\nNotes to editors:\nFuller's worked with London design and branding agency Jkr on the project.", "title": "Fullers New Bottle Introduction", "publishedDate": "2013-05-01T07:39:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-EroiCE5uY8", "description": "CNN's Ted Rowlands speaks with Afton \"Star\" Burton, a woman poised to become the future Mrs. Charles Manson", "title": "The future Mrs. Charles Manson", "publishedDate": "2014-11-19T04:05:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ErqxJcxLCE", "description": "", "title": "Mc Lowan - Essa \u00c9 A Top - M\u00fasica Nova 2013 - 2014", "publishedDate": "2013-12-20T02:59:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-EsiEs9VJjc", "description": "http://www.mailboxmiracle.com\n\nUnited Freedom Team Postcards - Get Rich Working At Home Mailing Postcards\n\nUnited Freedom Team Postcards - Get Rich Working At Home Mailing Postcards\n\nhttp://www.mailboxmiracle.com", "title": "United Freedom Team Postcards - Get Rich Working At Home Mailing Postcards", "publishedDate": "2014-09-20T13:37:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "-EswFKNXjMo", "description": "Against Saskatchewan at the Tim Hortons Brier 2009, Glenn Howard is trailing by two points.\n'This is the greatest shot I've ever made', - Glenn Howard.", "title": "Best Curling Shot of the year by Glenn Howard!", "publishedDate": "2009-09-16T05:57:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "-EtNr-o6J68", "description": "Chlorous Winklestein the famous ghost hunter has been forced out of the haunted forest as he failed when searching for ghosts...", "title": "Chlorous Winklestein Ghost hunting", "publishedDate": "2013-05-19T09:33:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-EtQBVqvHgk", "description": "Maxine demonstrates her soul food cooking prowess with this from-scratch creamed corn recipe at her restaurant in Prescott, AR.

It has a wide distribution range that overlaps with several other similar species. The habitat in which it is found is often marshy land with grass and tree cover. It is distinguished by its smaller size, less prominent bill, pale shaft streaks on the feathers of the head and back. It has a much longer claw on its hind toe and a distinct call. It is also among the few coucals that show season plumage differences but like in other coucals, the sexes cannot be distinguished in the field.\n\nThis slightly smaller-sized and shorter-billed coucal has a very long hind claw, the longest within the genus. The overall plumage, as in many other coucals, is of a blackish bird with a long tail and rufous wings. They have two plumages, a breeding plumage in which the head and upper back are glossy with dark shafts to the feather and a duller non-breeding plumage in which the feather shafts on the head and back are whitish. The wing coverts also have pale shafts showing as whitish streaks on the brown feathers. The central upper tail coverts are barred and very long. The iris is darker brown and not the crimson red as in the greater coucal. Juveniles have black spots, bars and have a browner colour.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_coucal", "title": "Lesser Coucal (Centropus bengalensis)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-23T03:29:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Ewc1q927xo", "description": "Scott Ota speaks about the German wine Liebfraumilch which he says makes for a great semi-sweet table wine. \n\nFind us on Google+ https://plus.google.com/b/113445358127735436475/113445358127735436475/posts\nLike us on Facebook - http://www.facebook.com/winesdotcom\n& Follow on Twitter @WinesCom & @BillElsey\nand Check out http://www.wines.com/ for great deals on wine & accessories!!", "title": "Liebfraumilch - with Scott Ota for Wines.com TV", "publishedDate": "2011-09-06T17:30:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-EwtrXhb124", "description": "http://www.vikingtactics.com\n\nLightweight, comfortable, and adaptable to a wide range of holsters and accessory pouches, the VTAC Battle Belt is made by Warriors for Warriors!", "title": "Viking Tactics Battle Belt (The Brokos Belt!)", "publishedDate": "2010-09-25T11:15:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ExPENesWOo", "description": "Meet the Brownie Goblin and Watch as your hosts encounter strange forces inisde their house.

Pennsylvania and New Jersey students can contact me for information on how they may obtain a MP3 of their required audition pieces.\n\nRecordings of original versions of any transcriptions should also be sought out.  In addition, it is highly encouraged that saxophonists learning these works practice them with a pianist even if the auditions do not require piano.

Constant high blood pressure can lead to life-threatening complications like:\n\n\u2022 Heart attack\n\u2022 Stroke\n\u2022 Kidney failure\n\u2022 Eye damage\n\u2022 Arteriosclerosis, etc.\n\nNormally, systolic and diastolic blood pressure should be around 120/80 mm/Hg. However, when it shoots up to 149 mm/Hg and 90 mm/Hg or more, then it is referred to as hypertension.\n\nSystolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart muscles contract. Diastolic reading refers to the pressure exerted on the artery walls between heartbeats as the heart relaxes.\n\nThe most common symptoms of this condition are:\n\n\u2022 Severe headache\n\u2022 Shortness of breath\n\u2022 Nausea\n\u2022 Dizziness\n\u2022 Nosebleed\n\u2022 Palpitation\n\nHowever, many people do not experience the symptoms even when the blood pressure readings are alarmingly high.\n\nHypertension cannot be attributed to one single factor. It can be caused by a combination of factors such as:\n\n\u2022 Smoking\n\u2022 Alcoholism\n\u2022 High-salt diet\n\u2022 Lack of exercise\n\u2022 Stress\n\u2022 Obesity\n\u2022 Genetics\n\u2022 Increasing age\n\u2022 Chronic kidney disease\n\u2022 Pregnancy\n\u2022 Adrenal diseases\n\u2022 Certain medications, antidepressants, decongestants, oral contraceptives, etc.\n\nBut don't lose heart. To keep the 'silent killer' at bay, some simple home remedies can be of use to you:\n\nHome Remedy 1\n\u2022 Take a cup of warm water.\n\u2022 Squeeze half a lemon in it. To reduce sourness, you can add honey.\n\u2022 Mix it well.\n\u2022 Drink this on empty stomach, regularly.\n\nHome Remedy 2\n\u2022 Grind equal quantities of dried watermelon seeds and poppy seeds (khus khus).\n\u2022 Take 1 teaspoon of this mixture in the morning on an empty stomach and again in the evening.\n\u2022 If you do not have poppy seeds, just add ground watermelon seeds in warm water and steep for half an hour. Strain the solution and drink it.\n\nHome Remedy 3\n\u2022 Have 1-2 crushed garlic cloves daily.\n\u2022 If you do not like eating raw garlic or if it causes a burning sensation, then take it along with a cup of milk.\n\nTips\n\u2022 Include watermelons and bananas in your diet.\n\u2022 Coconut water is also good for high blood pressure and nausea.\n\u2022 Have oats.\n\u2022 Avoid alcoholic and caffeinated beverages.\n\u2022 Reduce salt intake. To avoid salt, flavor your food with herbs and spices, even lemon.", "title": "High Blood Pressure - Top 3 Home Remedies", "publishedDate": "2014-05-01T16:56:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-FAJW09gnug", "description": "dimash", "title": "dimash", "publishedDate": "2013-04-25T18:11:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-FAXBN_T5yI", "description": "upsidupsi, schn\u00e4der\u00e4ngpeng\u00e4ng. tschacka, ding... dong", "title": "Rejoicing Child - Knie Knee Never (Worthless Is The Word Spoken)", "publishedDate": "2009-05-10T20:19:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "-FAmq6j7u58", "description": "This is a practice video for ASL 2 students to watch and translate.", "title": "ASL 2 Time Reduplication - Allergy Medicine", "publishedDate": "2014-11-18T12:06:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-FArKd4ghYQ", "description": "Learn how to make Bilbo's seed-cake in this video tutorial.
