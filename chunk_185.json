Nibiru the end of the world HD - Hercolubus Nibiru fotos e imagenes fin del mundo. ( Descripcion Editada El 19 - 10 - 2014 ).\n\n\n\n\nNibiru (planeta)\n\nNibiru es el nombre de un cuerpo celeste de la mitolog\u00eda babil\u00f3nica.\n\nNibiru en la mitolog\u00eda de Babilonia\n\nNibiru, para los babilonios, era un cuerpo celeste asociado con el dios Marduk. Nibiru significa \"lugar que cruza el oc\u00e9ano\" o \"lugar de transici\u00f3n del oc\u00e9ano \". En muchos textos babilonios se identifica con el planeta J\u00fapiter, aunque en la tablilla 5 de la En\u00fbma Elish se asocia con la Estrella Polar, que tambi\u00e9n se conoc\u00eda como Thuban.\n\nNibiru seg\u00fan la descripci\u00f3n de Zecharia Sitchin y la ufolog\u00eda\n\nZecharia Sitchin especul\u00f3 con la existencia de Nibiru en la serie Cr\u00f3nicas de la Tierra, especialmente en El 12.\u00ba planeta, bas\u00e1ndose en la idea de que las civilizaciones antiguas habr\u00edan obtenido sus conocimientos y su desarrollo gracias a hipot\u00e9ticos contactos con extraterrestres. Sin embargo, esta descripci\u00f3n es considerada inveros\u00edmil por cient\u00edficos e historiadores.\n\n\n\n\nNibiru\n\nNibiru (auch Neberu, Nebiru; dn\u00e9-b\u00e9-ru, mulni-bi-rum) ist einerseits der Name einer sumerischen und babylonischen Gottheit, andererseits die sumerische und babylonische mythologische Bezeichnung eines Himmelsobjekts in Verbindung mit einer astronomischen Konstellation.\n\nZuordnung als Gottheit\n\nIm Werk der babylonischen Weltsch\u00f6pfungserz\u00e4hlung En\u00fbma el\u00ee\u0161 (Als oben [der Himmel noch nicht genannt war]) wird in der f\u00fcnften Tafel Nibiru als eine der wichtigsten Gottheiten des Marduk erw\u00e4hnt: Als Marduk die Standorte (manzazu) des Nibiru, Enlil und Ea am Himmel festsetzte. In anderen babylonischen Texten wird statt der babylonischen Gottheit Ea auch die Himmelsgottheit Anu genannt.\n\n\n\n\nNibiru (Babylonian astronomy)\n\nNibiru (also transliterated Neberu, Nebiru) is a term in the Akkadian language, translating to \"crossing\" or \"point of transition\", especially of rivers, i.e. river crossings or ferry-boats. In Babylonian astronomy, Nibiru (in cuneiform spelled dn\u00e9-b\u00e9-ru or MULni-bi-rum) is a term of the highest point of the ecliptic, i.e. the point of summer solstice, and its associated constellation.\n\n\n\n\nNibiru\n\nNibiru est un nom de l\u2019astrologie babylonienne parfois associ\u00e9 au dieu Marduk. Nibiru appara\u00eet comme un personnage mineur dans le po\u00e8me de la cr\u00e9ation babylonien Enuma Elish de la biblioth\u00e8que d\u2019Assurbanipal, roi d\u2019Assyrie (668-627 avant J.-C.).\n\nDe fait, il s'est r\u00e9pandu la croyance que dans la mythologie babylonienne, Nibiru, Neberu ou Neburu \u00e9tait le nom par lequel on d\u00e9signait :\n\nsoit un astre associ\u00e9 au dieu Mardouk ;\nsoit le dieu Mardouk lui-m\u00eame.\nDe nos jours, une th\u00e9orie veut en faire une plan\u00e8te inconnue dans le syst\u00e8me solaire.\n\n\n\n\nNibiru\n\nNibiru (tamb\u00e9m traduzido como Neberu ou Nebiru) \u00e9 um termo em acadiano que significa \"cruzamento\" ou \"ponto de transi\u00e7\u00e3o\", geralmente relacionado a rios. Na astronomia babil\u00f4nica nibiru (grafado em escrita cuneiforme como Dn\u00e9-b\u00e9-runota ou ni-bu-rum) \u00e9 um termo do ponto mais alto da ecl\u00edptica, ou seja, o ponto do solst\u00edcio de ver\u00e3o e sua constela\u00e7\u00e3o relacionada. O estabelecimento do ponto do nibiru \u00e9 descrito na t\u00e1bua V do \u00e9pico Enuma Elish e associado ao deus Marduk (o protector da cidade da Babil\u00f3nia), e que geralmente acredita-se tratar do planeta J\u00fapiter.\n\n\n\n\n\u041d\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0443\n\n\u041d\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0301\u0440\u0443 \u2014 \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043d: \u043d\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u043e, \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441 \u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043c \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043c. \u0422\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u041d\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u042e\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u043b \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0430. \u041d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u044d\u0437\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c \u041d\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0443 \u0431\u044b\u043b \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0430\u043a\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0438 \u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u00ab\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u00bb (\u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440, \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0438). \u0412 \u0432\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u00ab\u041d\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0443\u00bb \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0442\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043c, \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u043c\u0441\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u044d\u043a\u043b\u0438\u043f\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u2014 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u044f.\n\n\n\n\nEl texto est\u00e1 disponible bajo la Licencia Creative Commons Atribuci\u00f3n Compartir Igual 3.0\n\nWeb Texto :\n\nhttp://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibiru_(planeta)\n\nWeb Licencia Texto :\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.es\n\n\n\n\n All music in this online collection created by Jason Shaw.

And people may have reason to be angry, but the way to solve that is to take away the reasons to be angry not to try and sound like Ukip ourselves.\" \n\n The lack of connection between the political class to working people \"and what it is like to earn your living in the real world\" is a weakness which Ukip have been allowed to exploit, believes MP for Northampton South Brian Binley.\n\n\"First of all you have to talk in his language, and that is a problem for the leaders of all three major political parties\" he said.\n\nThe Tories have to \"make clear\" that they actually have answers to the problems and frustrations faced by sections of electorate, argues Altrincham and Sale West MP Graham Brady, while Bill Cash, MP for Stone, said that immigration \u2013 an issue which Ukip has made much political capital out of \u2013 has to be tackled head on.\n\n\"The answers are quite simple, the question is do they have the political will to do it.\" \n\nGet the latest headlines http://www.telegraph.co.uk/\n\nSubscribe to The Telegraph http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=telegraphtv\n\nLike us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/telegraph.co.uk\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/telegraph\nFollow us on Google+ https://plus.google.com/102891355072777008500/\n\nTelegraph.co.uk and YouTube.com/TelegraphTV are websites of The Daily Telegraph, the UK's best-selling quality daily newspaper providing news and analysis on UK and world events, business, sport, lifestyle and culture.", "title": "Ukip win Rochester and Strood by-election: what should David Cameron do now?", "publishedDate": "2014-11-21T09:09:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "AfgcpYRuA38", "description": "This was an absolute horrendous match that clearly shows I have no idea how to approach the Elena matchup.

If you want that then go here http://www.cellulite-removal-tips.com\n\nThe gluteus muscles in your body are very important to a lot of daily movements and activities. These muscles are located in the buttocks, and can often benefit from a little TLC. \n\nSome people get embarrassed when talking about a buttock massage because it's such a personal area, but the reality is that you have a lot to gain by giving your butt muscles a little attention and helping them relax for a little while. Tight gluteus muscles can lead to a variety of different issues, including:\n\n-Back pain\n-Leg stiffness\n-Pain in the hips and legs\n-Aches and pain in the buttocks \n\nhttp://www.cellulite-removal-tips.com\n\nWith a glute massage, you can alleviate a lot of these issues, reduce the pain and stress that you are feeling, and get back to being comfortable in your daily life. Massaging just one part of your body will release 'feel good' chemicals that affect the rest of your body, which means that it's really about more than just your butt. \n\nEveryday use, combined with the fact that a lot of people spend a lot of time sitting, leads to tension and stress in the gluteus muscles for many. This tension can lead to serious pain issues, discomfort, and a difficulty enjoying life because of all of the pain and stress that is going on.\n\nFortunately, with a buttock massage, you can improve circulation, relieve muscle tension, reduce stress, and give your whole body a relaxing, calming feel that will help you in many different ways. \n\nWhen you are considering a buttock massage, keep in mind that it will:\n\n-Improve your blood circulation. This can lead to improved nutrient delivery, better muscle function, improved immune system, and more. When your blood is circulating properly, it will give your body a chance to be healthier in many ways. \n\n-Improve your muscle recovery time. When you use muscles, they need time to recover afterwards. Otherwise, they become tight, painful, and often can be strained or pulled. With a glute massage, you can improve your muscle health and know that they're ready for everyday activities, sports, and more. \n\n-Reduce pain and stress. Not only will this massage help alleviate the pain issues that you have in your glute muscles, but it will alleviate other issues throughout your body in many cases, as well. Sometimes people don't realize that sympathetic pain is their problem. For example, if your legs are constantly sore and tense, it might actually be related to your lower back or buttocks rather than stemming from your legs. Massage can reduce stress and alleviate pain in many areas of the body to keep things working like they should. \n\nhttp://www.massagetherapypros.ca/buttock-massage/\n\nhttp://www.cellulite-removal-tips.com", "title": "Buttock Massage | Glute Massage Treatment - Best Ever! | Maximus | Masssage Techniques | Massage", "publishedDate": "2012-07-20T18:22:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "Afo6bWRrSsA", "description": "Una opci\u00f3n \u00fanica y definida, con la esencia de tu cerveza de siempre.", "title": "Nueva Andes Barley Wine", "publishedDate": "2013-10-29T20:35:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "AfoC2uJZG6A", "description": "", "title": "YouTube - les algeriens au soudan.avi", "publishedDate": "2010-01-30T10:40:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "AfoJhbm1wTs", "description": "Get those medical secrets: http://www.health101.pw/Medical-Secrets.shtml\n\nThis video shows you how to say or pronounce Zestril.\n\nAudio is from cancer.gov.", "title": "How to Say or Pronounce Zestril", "publishedDate": "2013-08-16T18:06:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "AfoS9cmm9Qc", "description": "manganese ore magnetic separator magnetic separation iron ore equipment, Links: http://goo.gl/N1nfWU (Hot!!!)\nZenith is quite experienced in construction, milling and mining industry.

He was born in 2003 and we think he is a great pyrenees/lab/golden retriever/australian shepherd mix. I adopted him from our local shelter when he was about 6 months old. He is very calm and patient, and he loves to hang out and play with other animals, especially cats and kittens. I foster kittens for our local animal shelter, if you click on my youtube channel you will find lots of videos of Murkin and all the kittens we have fostered over the years.\n\nAbout Rupert Giles Wobblepants:\nRupert Wobblepants is a very special kitten that Murkin and I adopted. He has a condition called Cerebellar Hypoplasia. Its caused by a virus that infected his mother while she was pregnant, and it causes the cerebellum part of the brain to not develop properly. This causes the affected kittens to be clumsier than usual, but it causes them no pain. He also has a congenital heart defect, which we are currently in the process of treating. He was originally found abandoned in a cardboard box in front of a cat clinic. A technician there with a warm heart bottle fed him and nursed him back to health. They were having a hard time finding him a home so they contacted me to see if I could help them spread the word about this special boy. I fell in love with him instantly.\n\nFilmed with a sony handycam hdr cx-360.", "title": "A Very Cerebellar Laser Chase", "publishedDate": "2013-05-29T16:31:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "AfsQR0VGjVs", "description": "I squeeze the pus outta my boyfriend's blackheads.\n\n...IN HIGH DEFINITION!", "title": "Pore Squeezing", "publishedDate": "2010-05-14T04:08:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "AfsdKrVVv1c", "description": "Visit our website for text version of this Definition and app download. http://www.medicaldictionaryapps.com\n\nSubjects: medical terminology, medical dictionary, medical dictionary free download, medical terminology made easy, medical terminology song", "title": "What Is The Definition Of Hysterosalpingogram HSG - Medical Dictionary Free Online Terms", "publishedDate": "2014-10-11T22:56:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "AfstLbsxGE4", "description": "Saving a Norwegian Tradition smelling lutefisk for the first time", "title": "Smelling lutefisk for the first time", "publishedDate": "2009-02-02T04:40:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "Aft5UlFeqxo", "description": "LINK DE DESCARGA DEL TEMA OYE GRACIAS REMIX \n\nhttp://www.sendspace.com/file/8hdopj\n\nFace de Fresco: https://www.facebook.com/MeDicenFresco\n\nFace de Mc Richix: https://www.facebook.com/RichardAllanAlcarazLopez", "title": "Oye gracias (Remix) Fresco Ft Mc Richix (Rapsen Prod.)(Rap Romantico Mexico - Per\u00fa)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-27T18:30:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "AftMcE8F_G8", "description": "respnsiva", "title": "Responsive Front Page", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T18:17:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "Afto-MDNlJI", "description": "\u25ba\u25ba http://sincolonirritable.blogspot.com \u25c4\u25c4  Sintomas De Colon Inflamado\n\nSi bien estos s\u00edntomas pueden ser muy inc\u00f3modo, tambi\u00e9n puede haber algunas consecuencias graves si esta condici\u00f3n se deja sin tratamiento.

It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs, and can run at up to about 70 km/h (43 mph), the fastest land speed of any bird. The ostrich is the largest living species of bird and lays the largest eggs of any living bird (extinct elephant birds of Madagascar and the giant moa of New Zealand laid larger eggs).\n\nThe ostrich was originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th-century work, Systema Naturae under its current binomial name. Its scientific name is derived from Latin, struthio meaning \"ostrich\" and camelus meaning \"camel\", alluding to its dry habitat.\n\nThe ostrich belongs to the ratite order Struthioniformes. Other members include rheas, emus, cassowaries, moa, kiwi and the largest bird ever, the now-extinct elephant bird (Aepyornis). However, the classification of the ratites as a single order has always been questioned, with the alternative classification restricting the Struthioniformes to the ostrich lineage and elevating the other groups.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struthio_camelus\n\nThis video taken from Alipore Zoo at the time of visiting myself in April, 2014.

A video taken of the incredible procedure was posted online. \n\nExperts have suggested the cricket crawled in the ear in search of shelter during daylight hours. \nMichael Sweet, lecturer at the University of Derby, an expert on invertebrate biology, identified the creature to Daily Star Online as an Indian house cricket. \n\nHe said: 'These critters are known to be an invasive species, appearing all over the globe.\n'They like warm countries and hide during the day. It is likely this cricket crawled into the man's ear while he was sleeping and was just hiding there until night came around.'\n\nThe footage, thought to have been filmed by doctors at the South Zone ENT Research Centre in Villupuram, Tamil Nadu, India, starts with a camera that looks inside the patient's ear and shows the insect's legs twitching in the air.\n\nThe doctor then retrieves his narrow tweezers and uses them to gently pry the cricket from its new home.\n\nHe is careful not to simply dislodge the moving insect - fearing that it could bury further in. \nOnce it is firmly in the doctor's grasp, the cricket is lifted out into the darkened room and placed against the man's ear - to show just how big the creature is. The video ends with the cricket, still alive, crawling on a piece of paper. \n\nMr Sweet added that it was likely that the creature would have crawled out on its own. \n\nWhile the cricket is unlikely to have caused any serious harm to the man, it could have potentially damaged the inner ear - resulting in temporary balance and hearing issues.\nIt is not the first time that someone has been caught out by a wandering creepy-crawly. In August a father-of-three who felt a moth fly into his ear as he lay reading in bed had it buzzing around inside his head for three days.\n\nEventually Rob Fielding, 43, a marketing manager from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, sought medical help - and ended up needing a 90-minute operation to remove the insect from his ear canal.\n\nAnd in January this year, Australian doctors came to the aid of a man who had a cockroach crawl into his ear.", "title": "You won't believe what doctors found lurking in this man's ear", "publishedDate": "2014-10-07T20:19:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "AgVEt3DrOZs", "description": "An ADMET 7601 single column frame equipped with an eP2 touch panel controller and eccentric roller grips can be used to accurately run ASTM D412 to measure tensile strength and elongation.\n\nFor more information on this system please visit: http://info.admet.com/specifications/bid/53038/ASTM-D412-Tensile-Strength-and-Elongation-Testing-System-for-Under-8-000\n\nFor more test videos and how to's please visit: http://info.admet.com/", "title": "Test Elongation and Tensile Strength to ASTM D412 with ADMET", "publishedDate": "2011-01-18T15:38:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "AgVGZciOxsE", "description": "FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/colombiatec\n\nMAs informacion aqui en el link (FUENTE):\n\n\nhttp://www.linkbucks.com/HWU1\n\nLos pasajeros del Boeing 737 que viaj\u00f3 de Amsterdam (Holanda) a Birmingham (Reino Unido) se llevaron el susto de sus vidas al ser golpeados por tres rayos de forma consecutiva mientras estaban en pleno vuelo.\n\n\"Se\u00f1oras y se\u00f1ores, notaron que nos golpe\u00f3 un rayo\", le explic\u00f3 el piloto a los 174 pasajeros que sintieron que era el fin de todo.\n\nCasualmente una persona grab\u00f3 desde la tierra el impacto de los ratos.\n\n\nLightning Strikes Airplane Three Times During Landing | Amsterdam to Birmingham Plane Hit By Lightning Caught On Camera | Boeing 737 Plane Struck By Lightning THREE Times | Birmingham Lightning Strike \nAmsterdam to Birmingham Plane Hit By Lightning Caught On Camera | Boeing 737 Plane Struck By Lightning THREE Times | Birmingham Lightning Strike \nAmsterdam to Birmingham Plane Hit By Lightning Caught On Camera | Boeing 737 Plane Struck By Lightning THREE Times | Birmingham Lightning Strike \n\nA bright flash of light and booming noises in a cramped seat thousands of feet in the air would be enough to put off even the most hardened fliers.\n\nBut passengers landing at Birmingham airport on Friday afternoon were led by example as their captain coolly steered them through three lightning blasts and left it until afterwards to calmly explain what happened.\n\nPassengers spoke of a 'massive bang' as one of the bolts struck the body of the KLM service from Amsterdam, but the blasts had no effect on the landing, which proceeded as normal to touch down at 4.30pm.\n\nAnd after the plane, a Boeing 737, had touched down on the runway, the captain confirmed to his passengers that the service had been hit, saying simply: 'Ladies and gentlemen, you may have noticed we were hit by lightning.'\n\nTony Everitt, 51, was one of 174 passengers on board the flight, from which ominous 'dark skies' could be seen just before the first bolt struck.\n\nThe businessman, who was returning from a conference, said: 'It was incredible - there was one massive bang.

The disease is the growth of a tumor on the retina in the eye. Without treatment, it can cause the loss of an eye. This can be detected by pediatricians in an examination called \"the red reflex test\", in which a light is shined in the eye of the child and a red reflex light is returned to the physician. This can go undiagnosed by pediatricians and is often found by parents. These parents have taken pictures of their child and instead of two red eyes they only have one. This one white eye is actually the tumor reflecting back showing the cancer. This cancer is very treatable as long as it is detected early. Always have your pediatrician do full testing in this area.

It comes off as quite powerful, and overall the sounds mix well with each other. However, it does suffer from a dash of blandness as well, partly due to how generic these kinds of tracks are. Partly also because it's a midi, even if a well-constructed one, and thus suffers from its inherent midi-ness, which certainly doesn't help with being memorable. A lot of the power the real instruments would've had is lost in the transition to a midi. Interestingly enough, Dawn of Sorrow manages to pull of this kind of track quite expertly, with the Dark Chapel.\n\n====\n\nAnother soundtrack I'd noticed to not exist in youtube is the Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow soundtrack. Seeing how I own the soundtrack, I decided to upload the gamerip to youtube, at a relatively high quality. Yes, the gamerip. The OST version of the music has some relatively loud white noise in the background, and the quality is overall poorer. Weird, I know.\n\nSome of the tracks have different names than the in-game names, although for completely stupid reasons at times. If I feel that the soundtrack's name might be relevant, I'll add it as well.\n\nThe music for this game, Aria of Sorrow, was composed by Michiru Yamane, Soshiro Hokkai, and Takashi Yoshida. I'm afraid I don't know which one of the three composed which themes, so if anyone could tell me, I'd love to know. No clue who was the mastermind behind the artwork.

Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae are the only surviving family of the order proboscidea; other, now extinct, families of the order include mammoths and mastodons. The largest living terrestrial animals, male African elephants can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes, particularly for grasping objects. In addition to their trunks, their incisors grow into tusks, which serve as tools for moving objects and digging and as weapons for fighting. The elephant's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of its body. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\n\nElephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance, and predators such as lions, tigers, hyenas and wild dogs usually target only the young elephants (or \"calves\"). Females (\"cows\") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch, often the oldest cow. Elephants have a fission-fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Males (\"bulls\") leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.\n\nSource :- Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

The song recounts the virtues of hot water in comparison with rain water, stream water, ice water, and fountain water. Amazingly, hot water wins in all categories except one. Beer is said to be better than cold water for pouring down the throat and hot better for pouring down the back.\n\n\"Sing hey! For the bath at close of day\nthat washes the weary mud away\nA loon is he that will not sing\nO! Water Hot is a noble thing!\n\nO! Sweet is the sound of falling rain,\nand the brook that leaps from hill to plain;\nbut better then rain or rippling streams\nis Water Hot that smokes and steams.\n\nO! Water cold we may pour at need\ndown a thirsty throat and be glad indeed\nbut better is beer if drink we lack,\nand Water Hot poured down the back.\n\nO!

Suspected Islamist militants kidnapped seven French holidaymakers from one family, including four children, in Cameroon on Tuesday, business, diplomatic and security sources said.\n     GDF Suez confirmed that one of its employees had been kidnapped with his family.\n     French President Francois Hollande said during a visit to Athens that he was informed of the kidnapping by a Nigerian \"terrorist group that we know well\", without naming it.\n     \"What is most probable is they will be taken to Nigeria,\" Hollande told reporters, adding that France was doing everything possible to prevent that outcome.\n     A statement from GDF Suez said the employee was based in the Cameroon capital Yaounde and that the family were vacationing in the north of the west African country.\n     A Western diplomat in the region told AFP that six armed kidnappers on three motorbikes abducted a couple, their four children and an uncle in the northern village of Dabanga near the Nigerian border. \n     The children are aged five, eight, 10 and 12, the diplomat said. \n     A source close to the French embassy in Yaounde said the family had earlier visited Waza National Park in northern Cameroon.\n     Asked whether the kidnapping could be a reprisal for France's military offensive against Al-Qaeda-linked groups in northern Mali, Hollande spoke of Nigeria's Islamist Boko Haram group.\n     \"I note in particular the presence of a terrorist group, namely Boko Haram, in that part of Cameroon, and that's worrying enough,\" he said.\n     A Cameroonian security source also told AFP: \"We have strong suspicions regarding the Islamist sect Boko Haram,\" which is blamed for killing hundreds of people in an insurgency in northern Nigeria since 2009.\n     Some Boko Haram members are believed to have trained with militants of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in northern Mali.\n     Former French defence minister Hervin Morin said Tuesday it was \"much too early to say\" whether the kidnapping was linked to the Mali offensive but added that since the start of the conflict he had expected a test of French resilience. \n     \"We're very likely seeing the first actual case because, even if it's a different terrorist movement, all these Islamist movements are connected by a common struggle, that of a fight against the West,\" he told television channel BFMTV. \n     An anonymous source at the Waza nature reserve said the holidaymakers had visited it on Monday. \"They slept in the park's tourist camp (and) they left this morning,\" the source said.\n     A security source in the area told AFP that security forces were hunting for the kidnappers along the    border with Nigeria.\n     Though it was the first abduction of Western tourists on Cameroonian soil, there have been several hostage-takings off the coast, a region believed to be rich in oil and gas.\n     Cameroonian authorities have attributed attacks and kidnappings off the Bakassi peninsula neighbouring Nigeria to pirates. \n     In December, French engineer Francis Collomp was kidnapped in Nigeria in an act claimed by the Nigerian radical Islamist group Ansaru, which is thought to be a Boko Haram splinter group.\n     On Monday, Ansaru also claimed the kidnapping of seven foreigners in a deadly weekend raid on a construction site in northern Nigeria.\n     Tuesday's abduction brings the total of French hostages abroad to 15, all in Africa and at least six of whom are being held by AQIM.\n     According to the US monitoring group IntelCenter, France is the Western country with the highest number of hostages taken, followed by the United States with nine.\n     Cameroon, a former French colony of 20 million people, has vast ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity and counts no fewer than 10 active rebellions.", "title": "Seven French Vacationers kidnapped in Cameroon", "publishedDate": "2013-02-19T19:07:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "AhTSroYdbNw",

It wouldn't turn over when I got it so I took the plugs out and poured some Mistory oil in the holes and let it sit for a few weeks, I turned it back n forth till I was able to give it a few full turns, checked the oil level, put some gas in it, hooked up a battery and it turned over fine with the starter but no fire, pulled out the distributor to find a homemade shaft extention that wasn't long enough so I rebuilt the distributor, made a new shaft, rebuilt the carb, and now it fired up! I called  Adrian to come over and check it out, he said, \"It sounds good but don't try driving it untill you change the oil\".  Since the oil looked to be ok and at the correct level, I drove it up and down the alley. I called him again to let him know how it went and the first thing he asked was, \"Did you change the oil?\" So I got to work, took the drain plug out and oil dribbled out no matter what i did it wouldn't drain out so I took the oil pan off and found the oil caked at the bottom of the pan, lesson learned....

I don't know if he had brain trauma when he had that car accident in France that killed that women, or if he has Alzheimer's or some other mental issue.\n\nThursday night, Sept 27, 2012, Mitt Romney had a Fundraiser in Hong Kong and Ann Romney did this interview with Reno, Nevada t.v. station KTVN.\n\nIf Ann Romney's biggest concern, if Mitt were to become President, is Mitt's \"mental well-being\" then I am extremely concerned about Mitt's mental well-being too and I am not sure he should have the nuclear code.\n\nAside from Mitt underscoring his tendency to be a pathological liar over the past 20 years, many people, myself included, have wondered for a long time if Mitt Romney has some sort of mental illness either brought on through brain trauma or something else.\n\nMental illness is no laughing matter and my saying that is not meant to be funny ... it is meant to be serious because if Mitt's own wife is concerned about Mitt's mental well-being then so should ALL Americans before they cast their vote. \n\nOne of the early symptoms to Alzheimer's is short-term memory loss, forgetting what you recently said or did.  Confusion and poor judgment are also early signs.  In the early stages, the patient can still function in society but lacks good judgment so usually family members will step in to correct any problem the poor judgment may have caused.\n\nFor months, we have literally witnessed Romney say one thing, then within seconds tell the media he did not say it.  Then we go back to the video, and sure enough, Romney said what we thought he said.  Now, I know Romney is a pathological liar -- but I think there is something more going on.\n\nIf you watch Romney's face when he denies saying what he just said, Romney gets a confused and bewildered look in his eyes. It is the confusion on his face that makes me think he has Alzheimer's.  Reagan, and other patients of Alheimer's would get that same look.\n\nWe've had at least one President (Reagan) who had suffered from Alzheimer's while in office and another entire Administration that were pathological liars (Bush/Cheney) -- we do not need a President who is both a pathological liar and unstable mentally.\n\nI think Mitt is a pathological liar but I also heed Ann's words ... I, along with Ann Romney, am now very concerned about Mitt's mental well-being. \n\nI created this video with the YouTube Video Editor (http://www.youtube.com/editor)", "title": "Ann Romney: My Biggest Worry Is Mitt's \"Mental Well-Being\"", "publishedDate": "2012-09-29T06:01:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ahd3cCsDorE", "description": "Another whole roach for Gulon.", "title": "Gulon the gulper catfish eats.", "publishedDate": "2014-09-20T13:15:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "AhdFBuqqSfY", "description": "Song: If I Had A Heart by Fever Ray, here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBAzlNJonO8", "title": "[USF] Swipe_Kush Fraps vs veNality", "publishedDate": "2012-04-26T00:33:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "AhdNSOPXWWU", "description": "August\u69d8\u306e\u30a2\u30b9\u30d5\u30a9\u30c7\u30eb\u30b9\u3000\uff0dAsphodelus\uff0d\u3000\u3092\u521d\u97f3\u30df\u30af\u306b\u6b4c\u308f\u305b\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "title": "\u3010\u30dc\u30ab\u30ed\u30ab\u30d0\u30fc\u3011Asphodelus\u3010\u7a62\u7ffc\u306e\u30e6\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u3011", "publishedDate": "2012-11-17T17:02:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ahe1kYtpeQI", "description": "Brought to you by http://www.mmawarehouse.com.

It spends Northern Hemisphere summers in the Arctic and then for winter it flies all the way to the Antarctic! Absolutely crazy to think that in one year it has seen more of the world than most of us will in a lifetime. In this weeks video we take a look at the physics behind a few of the adaptations that the birds have evolved to be able to perform these annual migrations.

The nose was typical of a more simple Bordeaux wine which has red fruits, red currants, tabacco and with some earthiness and woodiness.  This medium body wine was slightly more diluted than what I expected of which politically correct writers / die hard Bordeaux drinkers would call it elegant or even feminine!  The fruit level was low but the acidity was high in comparison.  The mouth feel was a little thin with some soil and damp earth in the background.  The tannin present was also a little coarse so coupling with the acidity gave the wine some astringency.  The wine when released had such a hype because Wine Spectator awarded it a whooping 91 points.  I failed once again to understand why?  Although it does have some structure and sourly red fruit, it just doesn't have the depth and complexity.  The finish is medium.  Drink it up now.

Its simple math.  The Earth is more than a nuclear reactor, it is a creator of matter out of empty space using gravity as energy and sheer vast mass as fuel.  You know when you see those northern (or southern) lights shining that there bound to be an eruption or Earthquake somewhere cause those lights are the planet itself feeding on the energy and growing.  The mean global temperature of the globe is controlled by it.  It feeds on even the heat in the air.  It only gets cold at night because the Earth feeds on the warmth of the day.  The northern and southern poles are the beasts two mouths.  Earth is by definition a living thing in that it feeds and grows, like fire.

A number of mechanisms have been proposed as to how this works including proteins effect on the appetite promoting hormone called ghrelin.  Ghrelin is a gut hormone appropriately nicknamed the 'road rage hormone' -- this is the hormone that when fired up puts you in an \"I must eat or someone will die\" state of mind.  In the low carb world it is claimed that one of the benefits and potential mechanisms behind the fat loss that occurs with a low carb/high protein diet is the increased protein intake.  Both of these theories may be correct in-part, but experience and studies have shown something else is going on.  For example: I would argue that in a low carb diet it is not the increased protein intake, but the decreased carb intake that causes the fat loss. Why that is, is a good topic for another article, so I will leave that for later.  Another concern with protein intake and satiety is it seems to have its limits.  When dieting, one still has to be calorie conscious.  If eating a high protein diet truly suppressed appetite in a protein dependant amount (the more protein, the less appetite), then one could not eat a high protein diet!  This is obviously not the case as many people fail to reach their body goals on a high protein diet unless calories come into consideration.  So how it is protein suppresses appetite and can be so beneficial for weight loss and body morphing?  It seems some very smart people may be onto something:  A recent study published in CELL describes, in detail, how once protein crosses your lips, prevents more food from crossing your lips. Protein in your intestine sends a message to the brain that the intestine/stomach is full.  This back-and-forth communication causes a satiety signal and decreases the total amount of calories one consumes. \nFood intake in general can be modulated through mu-opioid receptors or MOR's (the same receptors morphine and similar narcotics bind too) on nerves found in the walls of the portal veins -- the major blood vessels that drain blood from the gut.  Stimulating these receptors increases food intake and suppressing them blocks food intake.  Intake of dietary protein antagonizes these receptors and lowers food intake.\n\nThis is done via a mechanism called gluconeogenesis, or the production of sugar in the body from non-sugar sources.  Once the brain gets the signal these mu-opioid receptors are blocked, it sends signals back to the gut telling it to increase the production of sugar.  This increased production of sugar tells the brain you are full and you stop eating!  But here is the catch: it has its limits.  As I suggested above, a number of hard working, diet obsessing people fail on high protein diets as calories are not considered. These same satiety inducing receptors can become overloaded (by eating too much protein in one setting) and made insensitive, thereby rendering their appetite control helpless. \nHow then, we must ask, can we use these God given dietary control aids to our benefit?  The secret: low dose protein.  The solution: Amino Muscle Snack Time! \nAmino Muscle Snack Time is a flavored amino acid chewable snack that comes in great tasting tablets.  They contain just the right amount of amino acids (the building blocks of protein) to suppress the mu-opiod receptors in your gut and help you control your caloric intake. They are low calorie and can used as needed to suppress your cravings when dieting or getting ready for that bodybuilding show or figure/fitness competition.  Head-to-head with other appetite suppressants, they work wonderfully and you get the benefits of good nutrition.  \nI would encourage anyone with a body goal to give them a try.  Science and deliverable nutrition once again to the rescue!  Until next time: Train with Your Brain! \nDr. Warren Willey \nAuthor: Better Than Steroids", "title": "Muscle Snacktime Protein anytime anywhere the athlete's snack-food", "publishedDate": "2013-06-20T12:08:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "AhzhiQA6-Aw", "description": "Distributed by WMG\nAtomic Garden\n\nhttp://www.badreligion.com/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/badreligion\nhttp://twitter.com/badreligion\n\n\nVisit us!  http://www.epitaph.com/\n\nSubscribe to Epitaph: http://www.youtube.com/user/EpitaphRecords\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/epitaphrecords\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/EpitaphRecs\n\nGoogle +: https://plus.google.com/102417535790430111898/posts", "title": "Bad Religion - Atomic Garden", "publishedDate": "2007-05-25T22:18:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "AhzqTdL9bdI", "description": "", "title": "Treinamento Abdominal Remador cfsd2011", "publishedDate": "2010-12-13T02:27:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "AhzqgD3DghA", "description": "Brittany Maynard, a woman with terminal brain cancer who moved to Oregon because of the state's law governing assisted suicide has died, People reports. \n\nMaynard was only weeks away from her 30th birthday. \n\nShe posted a goodbye message to her Facebook page: \n\n\"Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love.

State police at Huntington said the incident involved eight boys and eight girls, all ranging from ages 13 to 15, who attend Southern Huntingdon County High School.The boys allegedly sent explicit photographs using cellphones and other electronic devices to the girls, police said. The boys were hoping by sending the girls pictures of themselves, the girls respond back with nude photos.For several student peers this just crosses the line saying this gives a bad rep to their entire school.It is just very, very embarrassing and it is not something to be proud of. I really wish it wouldn't have happened because of the bad image it is going the rest of us, junior, Tom Jones said.According to police, many of the pictures were sent using the social media app Snapchat. The images shared through the app are erased from a phone just a few seconds after they're viewed. But many students are skeptical that these photos truly vanish.They think it is gone forever but it's not just because the picture disappears and you can't view it on your phone other people can bring it up especially the authorities, senior, Trent Collin said.Summary citations were issued to the boys for transmission of explicit image by a minor.Police are urging parents to talk to their kids about this kind of behaviors and warning them of the consequences and many peers believe the school administration along with parents should address this issue.I would take away their phone I would take away everything and to pay the fine I would sell their stuff, senior, Johnathan Miller said.", "title": "Huntingdon Co. students speak out about sexting citations", "publishedDate": "2014-03-25T20:19:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ai74iw1y8Hs", "description": "To by\u0142 szalony mecz w Gda\u0144sku.

In human cells, both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as UV light and radiation can cause DNA damage, resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day.[1] Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell's ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes. Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell's genome, which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis. As a consequence, the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure. When normal repair processes fail, and when cellular apoptosis does not occur, irreparable DNA damage may occur, including double-strand breaks and DNA crosslinkages (interstrand crosslinks or ICLs).[2][3]\n\nThe rate of DNA repair is dependent on many factors, including the cell type, the age of the cell, and the extracellular environment. A cell that has accumulated a large amount of DNA damage, or one that no longer effectively repairs damage incurred to its DNA, can enter one of three possible states:\n\n    an irreversible state of dormancy, known as senescence\n    cell suicide, also known as apoptosis or programmed cell death\n    unregulated cell division, which can lead to the formation of a tumor that is cancerous\n\nThe DNA repair ability of a cell is vital to the integrity of its genome and thus to its normal functioning and that of the organism. Many genes that were initially shown to influence life span have turned out to be involved in DNA damage repair and protection.[4] Failure to correct molecular lesions in cells that form gametes can introduce mutations into the genomes of the offspring and thus influence the rate of evolution.

This video can help you fix this problem. Apple provides a link to a website in Yosemite to install Java 6, that will allow Minecraft 1.8 to work. \n\nThe website link appears from the pop-up window with the text: \"To open \"Minecraft\" you need to install the legacy Java SE 6 Runtime. Click \"More info...\" to visit the legacy Java SE 6 download website.\"\n\nThe Apple web site http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572 links to Java 6, specifically 1.6.0_65, a 64 bit version. \n\nIf the page does not open (seems to be blank in Safari), you can select shift+command+option while clicking the link  or go to http://support.apple.com and via the search (top right with magnifying glass) type in\n\n\"Java for OS X\"\n\nThen you can find the page with the title \"Java for OS X 2014-00\"\n\nOtherwise try a different browser to get there.\n\nA direct link to the file is\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/downloads/DL1572/en_US/JavaForOSX2014-001.dmg\n\nAnother \"possible\" solution (but not in video)  is to go to download the latest version of Java 8.

At first, people built structures to protect against nocturnal monsters, but as the game grew players worked together to create wonderful, imaginative things. It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise over a blocky ocean. It\u2019s pretty. Brave players battle terrible things in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a land of mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea. You can buy Minecraft for PC/Mac, Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition on the XBLA Marketplace, and Minecraft: Playstation 3 Edition on the Playstation Network. Minecraft: Pocket Edition is available for iOS andAndroid. Minecraft is coming out for Playstation 4, Playstation Vita, and Xbox One soon, but we don\u2019t have release dates for those versions yet. So far 16,539,914 people bought the PC/Mac version of the game.

The allegations were made in a letter sent by the RCMP to the government of Switzerland seeking access to banking records. Schreiber had earlier raised money for Mulroney's successful 1983 bid to win the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party.\n\nMulroney denied the allegations, and launched a $50 million defamation suit against the Canadian government, alleging that the newly elected Liberal government of Jean Chr\u00e9tien was engaging in a smear campaign against its predecessor. The government settled out of court in early 1997, and agreed to publicly apologize to Mulroney, as well as paying the former prime minister's $2.1 million legal fees.\n\nAlthough there is no evidence that Mulroney accepted kickbacks while prime minister, he acknowledged in 2003 that shortly after stepping down in 1993 that he accepted $225,000 over 18 months from Schreiber, in three cash payments of $75,000 each. Mulroney was still a member of the Canadian House of Commons when one of the payments was made. Mulroney claims that this money was paid to him for consulting services he rendered to help promote a fresh pasta business\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_affair\n\nLithium\n\nThe future of Silicon Valley's technological prowess may well lie in the war-scarred mountains and salt flats of Western Afghanistan.\n\nUnited States Geological Survey teams discovered one of the world's largest untapped reserves of lithium there six years ago. The USGS was scouting the volatile country at the behest of the U.S. Department of Defense's Task Force for Business and Stability Operations. Lithium is a soft metal used to make the lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries essential for powering desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets.

He retired from wrestling in 1998.  \n\nGet the latest headlines http://www.telegraph.co.uk/\n\nSubscribe to The Telegraph http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=telegraphtv\n\nLike us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/telegraph.co.uk\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/telegraph\nFollow us on Google+ https://plus.google.com/102891355072777008500/\n\nTelegraph.co.uk and YouTube.com/TelegraphTV are websites of The Daily Telegraph, the UK's best-selling quality daily newspaper providing news and analysis on UK and world events, business, sport, lifestyle and culture.", "title": "Wrestlers bring fighting diplomacy to North Korea", "publishedDate": "2014-08-30T19:15:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "AiG0EqVma1o", "description": "Made a Skeletonmask, google \"DIY Geometric Paper Masks by Steve Wintercroft\" and you can download it and start making one yourself.

So let's talk about placenta.\n\nThere are some things in life -- such as a dessert concoction on Top Chef or a bubbling pizza -- that we see and immediately think, \"I want to eat that.\" Afterbirth is not one of them. Emerging from a different kind of \"oven,\" placenta is a membrane in the womb that passes nutrients to the fetus and waste to the mother. As the baby develops, the placenta allows the exchange of oxygen and antibodies.\n\nAnd after the child no longer needs it, to some mothers it's a beneficial snack.\n\nWhile it's not scientifically proven, ingesting placenta is believed to increase breast milk production and decrease the risk of post-partum depression in new mothers. Many women report a boost in energy.\n\nFor the strong-of-stomach, making a placenta smoothie and chugging it down is one way to do it. But if that's too reminiscent of the Twilight movies, there are other methods. Some parents hire professionals to cook and freeze-dry the placenta, then cut it into pill form.\n\nSeveral cultures, such as in parts of Italy and Vietnam, have been known to traditionally embrace this practice as well. Placenta has even been used in traditional Chinese medicine. In Hungary, women bite it to lessen complications during childbirth.\n\nNot to mention, most other mammals do it as well. In order to sustain themselves after giving birth, animals eat the nutrient-rich placenta instead of expending energy hunting or scavenging.\n\nFor something that has been practiced for ages by various cultures and other mammals, placenta consumption has raised a lot of controversy in our society. Opponents of the idea argue that the process of putting placenta in \"pill form\" is unregulated, and mothers aren't fully aware of exactly what they're ingesting.\n\nHowever, proponents continue to say the anecdotal evidence is overwhelming and refuse to deviate from their post-partum nutritional plan -- whether it's appetizing or not.", "title": "Why Do Some Moms Eat Placenta?", "publishedDate": "2012-04-05T12:30:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "AiL4kNKErF0", "description": "\uc9c0\ub09c\ud574 \ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8 '\uc0ac\ub791\ube44', '\uc751\ub2f5\ud558\ub77c 1997', '\uc544\ub4e4 \ub140\uc11d\ub4e4'\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uae30\uc790\ub85c\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \ud55c \ud574\ub97c \ubcf4\ub0b8 \uac83\uc740 \ubb3c\ub860 \ubba4\uc9c0\uceec\uacfc \uac01\uc885 \uad11\uace0, \ud654\ubcf4 \uacc4\ub97c \uc12d\ub835\ud558\uba70 \uba85\uc2e4\uc0c1\ubd80 \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 '\ub300\uc138\ub0a8'\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\ub97c \uad73\ud78c \uc11c\uc778\uad6d\uc774 \uc9c0\ub09c\ud574 4\uc6d4 \ubc1c\ud45c\ud55c \ubbf8\ub2c8\uc568\ubc94 [Perfect Fit] \uc774\ud6c4 1\ub144\ub9cc\uc5d0 \ubc1c\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8 \uc2f1\uae00 \uc568\ubc94\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\uce35 \ub354 \uae4a\uace0 \uc131\uc219\ud574\uc9c4 \uc18c\uc6b8 \ubc1c\ub77c\ub4dc \uace1 '\uc6c3\ub2e4 \uc6b8\ub2e4'\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \ub3cc\uc544 \uc654\ub2e4.\n\n\uc12c\uc138\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ub354\ud574 \ud55c\uce35 \uc131\uc219\ud55c \ubcf4\uceec\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c \ub3cc\uc544\uc628 \uc11c\uc778\uad6d!

In 2012, he spent the most incredible year with his acting career in 'Sarangbi,' 'Answer me 1997,' and 'Sons.' Since his appearance in several dramas, he released a mini album 'Perfect fit' last April. Now his new D/S album 'I Smiled and then I Cried' releases this month. The title song of the album of which name is the same as the album's is ballad, the genre he has never tried before. Added to the strings of a guitar is his restrained, yet emotional vocal. The song is about a confront of the reality after a breakup and feelings of loneliness and grief. Especially, in the MV, Goo Hae Sun starred as his ex-girlfriend. She also wrote one of the songs in the album. \n\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-------------------\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad-\u00ad\u00ad-\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad-\u00ad--\u00ad--\u00ad--\u00ad--\u00ad--\u00ad--\u00ad-\nCJ E&M Music\uc740 \uc544\uc2dc\uc544 No.1 \uc5d4\ud130\ud14c\uc778\uba3c\ud2b8 \uae30\uc5c5\uc778 CJ E&M\uc758 \uc74c\uc545\uc0ac\uc5c5 \ube0c\ub79c\ub4dc\ub85c \uc74c\uc6d0/\uc74c\ubc18\uc758 \ud22c\uc790\u2022\uc81c\uc791\u2022\uc720\ud1b5\ubd80\ud130 \ucf58\uc11c\ud2b8\u2022\ud398\uc2a4\ud2f0\ubc8c \uac1c\ucd5c\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

With the normal configuration, the H2 SUT features two rows of seating and a three-foot-long open cargo bed behind the rear bulkhead, or Midgate, as Hummer calls it. However, with the rear window lowered into the Midgate, and the Midgate and rear seat folded forward, the cargo bed can be extended to six feet.By lowering the windows and opening the sunroof, all of which can be opened easily at the touch of a button thanks to an express-down feature, drivers can experience near open-air driving. Owners love the safe and solid ride in the iconic behemoth, the 4WD performance, menacing style, and long list of standard features. The ride is contagious......in short, the Hummer is a big, bad driving machine that will go over just about anything.

Antiangiogenic compounds can reverse the effects of angiogenesis. This happens by cutting off the blood supply to the tumor, which will cause it to shrink down to a size where the body's immune system can kill off the rest of the cancer.

Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family, nor are they from Guinea. They originated in the Andes, and earlier studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggested they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as Cavia aperea, C. fulgida, or C. tschudii and, therefore, do not exist naturally in the wild. Recent studies applying molecular markers,in addition to studying the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals,revealed that the ancestor is most likely Cavia tschudii.\n \nThe guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture of many Indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.Since the 1960s, efforts have been made to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.\n \nIn Western societies, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature, their responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them, continue to make the guinea pig a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.\n \nBiological experimentation on guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were frequently used as a model organism in the 19th and 20th centuries, resulting in the epithet \"guinea pig\" for a test subject, but have since been largely replaced by other rodents such as mice and rats. They are still used in research, primarily as models for human medical conditions such as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy, and pregnancy complications.", "title": "10\u65e5\u76ee\u3000\u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u6211\u304c\u5bb6\u306b\u3084\u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f \u30cf\u30e0\u30b0\u30c3\u30ba5", "publishedDate": "2013-05-21T00:02:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "AiWl3fOfU-M", "description": "Despite the global financial meltdown, the garment export industry in Bangladesh has yet to see a downturn.

Toklas (April 30, 1877 -- March 7, 1967) was an American-born member of the Parisian avant-garde of the early 20th century.\n\nShe was born Alice Babette Toklas in San Francisco, California, into a middle-class Jewish family (her father had been a Polish army officer[1]) and attended schools in both San Francisco and Seattle. For a short time she also studied music at the University of Washington. She met Gertrude Stein in Paris on September 8, 1907, the day she arrived. Together they hosted a salon that attracted expatriate American writers, such as Ernest Hemingway, Paul Bowles, Thornton Wilder, and Sherwood Anderson, and avant-garde painters, including Picasso, Matisse, and Braque.\n\nActing as Stein's confidante, lover, cook, secretary, muse, editor, critic, and general organizer, Toklas remained a background figure, chiefly living in the shadow of Stein, until Stein published her memoirs in 1933 under the teasing title The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. It became Stein's bestselling book\n.\n\"She was a little stooped, somewhat retiring and self-effacing. She doesn't sit in a chair, she hides in it; she doesn't look at you, but up at you; she is always standing just half a step outside the circle. She gives the appearance, in short, not of a drudge, but of a poor relation, someone invited to the wedding but not to the wedding feast,\" wrote W. G. Rogers in his 1946 memoir of the couple, When this you see remember me GERTRUDE STEIN in person.\n\nPoet James Merrill wrote that before meeting her \"one knew about the tiny stature, the sandals, the mustache, the eyes\" but that he had not anticipated \"the enchantment of her speaking voice\u2014like a viola at dusk.\"\n\nToklas and Stein were a couple until the latter's death in 1946.", "title": "Alice B.Toklas Girlfriends in Paris 1920's", "publishedDate": "2013-11-14T23:59:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "Aic9tdrAocE", "description": "", "title": "Curious George Goes Sledding Old Cartoon 1980s", "publishedDate": "2014-02-17T11:38:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "AicA_bbAN5Q", "description": "This a quick look at what is inside the revelation photo visual kit.\nIt has 9 12 15 20 32mm plossl eyepieces.\nt ring adaptor, lockable metal foam padded case , 5 filters and a 2x barlow.\nAll in 1.25mm .

Notice many of the elders serve as protectors to ensure safety of the Sufis dancers.\n\nNotice the young boys who learn early on how to enter into the trance- induced Sufi dervish dance states.\n\nThe head elder allowed this to be filmed when a visiting videographer asked permission.  The elder came up directly to the vidoegrapher's face and stared into his eyes from one inch from his face and stared for 1 minute and then gave him permission saying he was genuine in his intent for filming.  The elder said there is other music they play with their drums that causes listeners, and practitioners to lose consciousness but the head elder would not allow that specific ceremony to be filmed.  \n\nNotice the unique indigenous clothing and long hair that the elders and older Sufis have; while the younger boys are dressed in western style clothing.

Activities begin at 10 am and end at 3 pm.  For more information visit albertaparks.ca.\n\nEver wonder what bears do when we're not looking?  These images were captured with a remote wildlife camera as various species visited a \"communications\" or \"rub\" tree in Kananaskis Country, leaving a scent as a form of communication to other bears and animals.  The image data is being collected as part of a collaborative study looking at multi-species habitat use within our mountainous landscape.  In addition to various wildlife species, millions of people visit Kananaskis Country each year. Alberta Parks dedicates significant efforts to maintaining a positive coexistence of wildlife and park visitors through tools such as our bear shepherding program, wildlife proof garbage bins and superior visitor education. \nLearn more about human/wildlife conflict prevention at www.wildsmart.ca.

Melbourne, 1st May, 1903\n\nMelbourne, Government Printer, 1903.\n\nFoolscap folio, 38, 27 (the last one a large folding chart), 21, [3] (blank) pages.\n\nStapled as issued; first and last leaves a little marked, with a few small marginal chips stabilised; mild signs of use; a very good copy with a cancelled Australian War Memorial Library stamp on the first page and two small library labels at the rear.\n\nA Commonwealth Parliamentary Paper (F4060; the appendices have their own reference numbers). Major-General Sir Edward Hutton (1848-1923) was commandant of the New South Wales Military Forces from 1893 to 1896. He returned to England a convinced Imperialist, and quickly began to propagate his ideas on Australian defence. In a widely-reported address, the concept of the Australian soon to be popularized by C.E.W. Bean was already discernible: 'The Australian is a born horseman. With his long, lean muscular thighs he is more at home on a horse than on his feet, and is never seen to a greater advantage than when mounted and riding across bush or a difficult country. Fine horsemen, hardy, self-reliant, and excellent marksmen, they are the beau ideal of Mounted Riflemen. Accustomed to shift for themselves in the Australian bush, and under the most trying conditions of heat and cold, they would thrive where soldiers unaccustomed to bush life would die.... In 1901 the first Australian government appointed Hutton to command and organize its land forces' (Australian Dictionary of Biography). This is his important first report, outlining his plans for the Commonwealth forces. The AWM has perhaps erred in deleting this copy from its stock: the letters 'GOC' (General Officer Commanding) in red pencil on the cover indicate that it was none other than Major-General Sir Edward Thomas Henry Hutton's personal copy! The lengthy appendix 'Scheme of Organization of the Military New South Wales Field Force ... and into Garrison Troops' has numerous pencil annotations (some relating to the presence of drill halls and rifle ranges in different areas). Loosely inserted is a mimeographed sheet (foolscap folio, folded twice), headed 'No. 24 Light Horse School. Sydney February 18th to 29th, 1904. Synopsis of Work' - how rare is that?

While thousands wander the rubble, lost and homeless, Colonel Lewis Morgan, charged with overseeing the rebuilding of this devastated city and the de-Nazification of its defeated people, is stationed in a grand house on the River Elbe. He is waiting for the arrival of his wife Rachael--still grieving for their eldest son, one of the war's many casualties--and their only surviving son, Edmund. But rather than force the owners of the house, a German widower and his rebellious daughter, out onto the streets, Lewis insists that the two families live together. In this charged atmosphere, both parents and children will be forced to confront their true selves as enmity and grief give way to passion and betrayal, to their deepest desires, their fiercest loyalties, and the transforming power of forgiveness. \n\nhttp://www.rhidianbrook.com/\nhttp://www.randomhouse.com/book/216066/the-aftermath-by-rhidian-brook", "title": "The Aftermath by Rhidian Brook", "publishedDate": "2013-05-28T14:34:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "AiwjNIinksQ", "description": "Bronco Buster is a 8' ledge at kansas rocks.

In 2008, millions of Americans thought they had found the real thing.\n\nOver the subsequent two years the nation moved inexorably - though rarely without battle - toward European-style socialism. Through the warring perspectives of a few powerful, deluded men and women who claim to know what's best for you resulted a national drama rife with both bureaucracy creation and wealth destruction.\n\nThe Socialist moved from the halls of academia to the offices of ACORN to a pew in Chicago, and eventually all the way to the oval office, all the while spurred on by the heady early days of a culture-changing phenomenon in the making. In the midst of the chaos and mounting disasters, average American citizens began to object, eventually adding up to more than the sum of their parts in what has become a multifront, 21st century clash of worldviews.\n\nThis film has not yet been rated, but the story received a solid B+ from the White House.

Levine, Nan Morales, Michael Shamberg, Stacey Sher, Hilary Swank\nScreenwriter: Richard LaGravenese, Freedom Writers, Erin Gruwell\nFilm Description: Assigned the thankless task of teaching freshman English at a gang-infested Long Beach, CA high school, a 23-year-old teacher resorts to unconventional means of breaking through to her hardened students in director Richard LaGravenese's adaptation of Erin Gruwell's best-seller The Freedom Writer's Diaries: How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them. Her students had been written off, and her chances of succeeding scoffed at, but Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank) wasn't about to go down without a fight. Long Beach is a place where a new war is waged with each passing day, and when the hardened students who walk those dangerous hallways sense an outsider attempting to understand their plight, their cynical resentment threatens to keep a deadly cycle in motion. Despite the initially hostile reaction she receives in the classroom, Gruwell uses the writings of Anne Frank and Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Sarajevo to teach her students not only the basis of the English language, but compassion and tolerance as well. Later, when the time comes to tell their own tales in a project specially designed to explore the daily violence that the majority of students have grown numb to, the barriers that had once stood so strong gradually begin to crumble. When the only chance for survival is to befriend the person who was once your mortal enemy, the world is opened to a whole new realm of possibilities.\n\n\"freedom writers\",\"freedom writers clip\",\"freedom writers part 1\",\"freedom writers trailer\",\"imelda staunton\",\"april l hernandez\",\"jason finn\",\"pat carroll\",\"richard lagravenese\",drama,\"inspirational stories\",\"stacey sher\",\"danny devito\",\"michael shamberg\",\"nan morales\",\"daniel s levine\",\"hilary swank\",\"jordana glick-franzheim\",\"tracey durning\",\"heroism videos\",\"humility videos\",\"strength videos\",\"high school videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++326847,/m/0mz73,/m/01tspc6,/m/05rpst", "title": "Freedom Writers (5/9) Movie CLIP - You Are The Heroes (2007) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T04:45:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "AjGJPVR9yqA", "description": "sorry for poor quality..", "title": "Bootlickers @ Jungstar, Sugarfactory 4/10/08", "publishedDate": "2008-11-13T15:45:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "AjGlDfy-57A", "description": "iTunes: http://bit.ly/Tou82n\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/kinagrannis\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/kinagrannis\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nHad so much fun hanging with Dia and her crew while making this video!
