Taking cuttings from your known good female cannabis plants (cloning them) is the best way to be certain you will get the quality and quantity of medicine you are needing from the plants you grow.  \nThe process is fairly simple -\nIn 1 gallon of filtered water add:\n2 tablespoons (I mistakenly said teaspoons in the video) of Dyno-gro's KLN Rooting Concentrate\n1 teaspoon of SuperThrive\n\nSaturate the potting mix you will be putting the cutting into with this solution and pour a small amount into a container to dip the cuttings into.\n\nFind a side shoot on your plant that has at least 4 sets of leaves.  Cut off the bottom pair of leaves and then cut the stem of the side branch close to where it attaches to the main stem with a clean pair of sharp scissors or a sharp knife.  Immediately dip the end of the cut branch into the container of rooting solution (to prevent an air embolism from forming in the stem of the cutting) and let it soak for a minute or two.  Poke a hole into the saturated potting soil with a pencil or something slightly larger than the stalk, and put the cutting into the hole.  Gently press the soil around the stalk so it is stable.  Put the plant under a translucent cover so that the plant will get plenty of diffused light and remain in a high humidity environment, but make sure there is some air exchange so as to reduce the chances of mold forming.  \n\nOnce you put the cutting into the pot DO NOT WATER the cutting until it roots unless the soil it is in becomes visibly dry, which should not happen if it is in a proper high humidity chamber.  Adding water encourages root rot, a fungi that can kill your cutting. \n\nKeep it in an area where it will not get more than an hour or so of morning or evening direct sunlight. Keep it fairly cool, don't let it get over 85 F if you can help it, but don't let it drop below 70 F during daylight hours and 60 F during the night while rooting.\n\nBe patient, don't unnecessarily disturb the cutting to figure out if it has put out roots.  You will know it has put out roots when you see new growth forming on the cutting.  \n\nOnce rooted the plant should be gradually hardened off to full sun and plenty of air movement.  Taking it straight from under a humidity tent in a sheltered area to full sun and wind will shock and possibly kill it.", "title": "Basic cannabis cloning - tips for success", "publishedDate": "2012-06-16T04:47:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "32yhKQxKvRc", "description": "El verano nos hizo vivir grandes aventuras en todo mi Per\u00fa. \u00a1Estas han sido las mejores vacaciones!", "title": "[Inca Kola] - Persiguiendo el verano - Costa", "publishedDate": "2014-02-20T20:45:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "32ylHbwe4VA", "description": "How important is a name?

Do they meaningfully contribute to assessments of student potential or progress? Are such assessments pedagogically or even ethically sound? Do they inherently degrade students? What socioeconomic and political forces influence which words are chosen for student evaluation? Of course, there is always the elephant in the living room: how can educators who should know better than anyone that languages are living things, that definitions are by definition fluid mutual agreements involving context, support such questionable definitions of \"definition\"? In my view...the voicing of which in this educational setting is perhaps anathema to Stanley Fish...these are reasonable critiques. Languages are living and definitions are fluid. A meaningful example of the transitory nature of definitions is found in the verb \"treat.\" Within a few years, \"to treat\" shifted definitions from meaning, \"to pay for\" to \"to put in ones place.\" The transitory essence of definitions like treat does not lend itself to meaningful evaluation by standardized tests like the SAT. My grandmother thanked me for \"treating\" to dinner on her 80th birthday and a waitress coworker of mine recently \"treated\" one of the waiters for complaining about his girlfriend so much. Furthermore, there is religious prejudice in standardized tests. The word \"catholic\" was presented as a synonym of \"universal.\" \"Anathema\" is a word directly rooted in the religious texts of the Judeo-Christian cultures. In this sense, \"standardized tests\" are essentially \"pseudostandardized.\" The assumption that their very name rests on is that there CAN be a crosscultural standardization inclusive of all socioeconomic variations. I admit...despite the cogent assertions of Stanley Fish...that I find this ludicrous. For example if you are an elderly Caucasian reading this you may not be aware of the connotations that Ludacris has infused in the word ludicrous to certain younger people. If you were told that you would be barred entry from educational institutions due to your ignorance regarding this connotation...that is, a connotation of a culture overlapping but not inclusive of your own, most of you would find the exclusion ludicrous.\n\n\n\n\nSo how can someone who is so skeptical of the evaluative process essentially partake in it by creating videos intended to assist students who are studying for the English vocabulary section of the S.A.T.? Isn't the S.A.T. one of the most recognizable standardized tests to students across America? Isn't the S.A.T. one of the most loathed? For me, it all comes down to a word: pragmatism.\n\nThe reality that I face, that hundreds of millions of American educators face...and yes, I believe there are hundreds of millions of educators in the United States...I believe that education is not limited to the classroom and \"educators\" not a title reserved for professional teachers...is that elderly Caucasians are not nearly as functionally limited by their ignorance regarding the connotative effects of Ludacris as teenagers are limited by their ignorance of which fluid definitions are transitorily agreed upon by socioeconomically privileged people regarding infrequently used words. Therefore, I partake in the system.\n\nWhich is why I make little videos to teach the teenagers studying for the SAT...and anyone with an interest to know...what most privileged people consider those transitory definitions to be. I understand I am perpetuating and endorsing a broken system as I attempt to empower people to function within it.", "title": "SAT Vocab Conflagration; English Vocabulary Builder; Study English Vocabulary; Definitions", "publishedDate": "2012-04-24T21:45:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "3311pMkrasA", "description": "", "title": "About Weight Gain After Pregnancy", "publishedDate": "2014-05-23T15:45:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3319vRUww1k", "description": "http://www.praizion.com\nPMP student in Spain blasts the exam!\nStudied my book based on 4th Edition but passed the 5th Edition Exam!\nSheer Doggedness and Determination + *WildCard!", "title": "PMP student in Spain blasts the exam", "publishedDate": "2013-10-02T00:21:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "331Cc24IzMk", "description": "Okay, so I may have said a few of these myself...\n\nStalk me on the Twitters and the Facebooks!\nhttp://www.twitter.com/slightlygriff\nhttp://www.facebook.com/slightlyimpressive\n\nThe song in the outro is \"Skydiving\" by Skautomatic weapons.

Big thanks to batlin for requesting this one. It's difficult to reproduce on the piano though and this should be considered a simplified arrangement because there is just so much 'atmospheric' stuff going that is so difficult to capture on the piano, and I'm not too happy with this take as well, it has quite some flaws in it, but I'm pretty much finished at the moment so I'll let this one pass. I have reached the point where I have to take it easy because I can feel that some kind of collapse or breakdown might be not too far away if I continue like I have in the past three weeks, so I think I'm gonna include the collab pieces into the count because doing the piano part for them is just as much work as doing a solo piece. In the past two days I recorded the piano parts for the collabs with joshi3joshi and ViolinTay, both in 24 hours each, hence, I have for all intents and purposes reached my goal, this would be video no. 24. The collabs will be up once my partners have recorded their parts which shall also, contrary to the original plan, not be rushed, but you can look forward to the videos and I believe they will please quite a few people, they should be up before Christmas. I will now take a break until I receive Zorsy's choice, then the duet with him shall be T3|-| |=1/\\/4|_ B4tt|_3.

She got her break in 1960, left university and started touring in the States.\n\n''I did my first tour with Brownie McGee and Sonny Terry who had been my idols and then I was playing with them, she recalled in 1993. And then I went off to Los Angeles. There was a festival up in Idlewild, the University of California had this arts festival every summer and I taught Canadian folk songs. I never got back to University. I just kept going and eventually I hit New York.''\n\nGrief over theft\nWhat followed were those six albums, years of touring and lots of grief over her song Morning Dew being stolen by Tim Rose. In November 1969 she made her London debut at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, and settled in the city the following year.\n\n\nLost Ladies of Folk\nShe recorded just this one album for Argo, then one for Polydor in 1976 (Morning Dew), followed by a few singles in the early eighties. Since then its been pretty much reissues, retrospectives and compilations.\n\nShe had in fact called it quits ''I didnt feel I was growing, I didnt feel I was doing anything.

Em 1949, apresentou-se no Teatro Municipal do Rio de Janeiro, interpretando \"La Boh\u00e8me\", e desde ent\u00e3o participou de todas as temporadas at\u00e9 1972, em in\u00fameras \u00f3peras. Cantou ao lado de celebridades como Mario Del Monaco, FerruccioTagliavini, Siminato, Boris Christoff, Guelfi, Italo Tajo, Rossi Lemeni, Georgi Mellis, Gottlieb, Tadei e Damiano.\nLia Salgado especializou-se em m\u00fasica erudita brasileira e dedicou-se \u00e0 sua difus\u00e3o no exterior. Gravou 10 LPs de m\u00fasica brasileira, incluindo a primeira grava\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00fasica colonial mineira, \"Missa em F\u00e1\", de Lobo de Mesquita. Apresentou-se com \u00eaxito em palcos da It\u00e1lia, Fran\u00e7a, Espanha, Portugal, Inglaterra, Argentina e Estados Unidos. Lia era esposa do m\u00e9dico e pol\u00edtico mineiro Cl\u00f3vis Salgado, cujo acervo tamb\u00e9m foi doado ao MHAB.\n\n\n** Mozart Camargo Guarnieri, ou simplesmente Camargo Guarnieri (Tiet\u00ea, 1 de fevereiro de 1907 \u2014 S\u00e3o Paulo, 13 de janeiro de 1993) foi um compositor e regente brasileiro.\nSeu pai era um imigrante italiano e sua m\u00e3e vinha de uma tradicional fam\u00edlia paulista. O pai, Miguel Guarnieri, era barbeiro e m\u00fasico, e tocava flauta. A m\u00e3e, G\u00e9cia Camargo, tocava piano. O pequeno Mozart aprendeu m\u00fasica em casa.\nTeve aulas de piano a partir dos dez anos de idade com Virg\u00ednio Dias. Para este professor dedicou sua primeira composi\u00e7\u00e3o, a valsa Sonho de artista (1918). A obra foi desdenhada pelo professor, mas seu pai julgou que a obra era fruto de promissor talento, pagando sua publica\u00e7\u00e3o em 1920.\nEm 1923, Miguel Guarnieri decidiu mudar-se com a fam\u00edlia para S\u00e3o Paulo a fim de proporcionar melhores condi\u00e7\u00f5es de estudo da m\u00fasica ao filho. Sendo uma fam\u00edlia de poucos recursos financeiros, Guarnieri trabalhou junto com o pai na barbearia e trabalhou como pianista. At\u00e9 1925 manteve v\u00e1rios empregos, tocando em cinemas, lojas de partitura e casas de baile da cidade. Estudou piano com Ernani Braga...\nA obra musical de Camargo Guarnieri \u00e9 formada por mais de 700 obras e \u00e9 provavelmente o segundo compositor brasileiro mais executado no mundo, superado apenas por Villa-Lobos. Pouco antes de sua morte recebeu o pr\u00eamio \"Gabriela Mistral\", sob o t\u00edtulo de \"maior compositor das Am\u00e9ricas\".\n\n*** Juvenal Galeno da Costa e Silva (Fortaleza, 27 de setembro de 1836 \u2014 Fortaleza, 7 de mar\u00e7o de 1931) foi um poeta brasileiro, de grande destaque nas letras cearenses.\n\nFilho de Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio da Costa e Silva, proeminente agricultor, e de Maria do Carmo Te\u00f3filo. Pelo lado paterno, era primo do Bar\u00e3o de Aratanha e, atrav\u00e9s de sua m\u00e3e, sobrinho do pol\u00edtico Manuel Te\u00f3filo Gaspar de Oliveira e primo do igualmente poeta Rodolfo Te\u00f3filo.\n\nFez seus primeiros estudos em Pacatuba e Aracati. Cursou Humanidades no Liceu do Cear\u00e1, em Fortaleza. O pai desejava que ele trabalhasse na \u00e1rea agr\u00edcola e por isso o manda para o Rio de Janeiro estudar \"assuntos de lavoura\". Conta-se que ao se tornar amigo de Paula Brito, propriet\u00e1rio de uma famosa tipografia na \u00e9poca, Juvenal chegou a conhecer Machado de Assis, Quintino Bocaiuva e Joaquim Manuel de Macedo. foi nesta altura que iniciou sua colabora\u00e7\u00e3o liter\u00e1ria na revista Marmota Fluminense, a mesma em que Machado de Assis escrevia.

Consider a song like \"Tom's Diner\" by Suzanne Vega. An American teaching English overseas once told us that students love that song.Recently we asked people on the Special English Facebook page to suggest other songs that English learners might like.  Noemi Nito wrote: I'm one of those English students who love \"Tom's Diner.\" I started learning English with \"Lemon Tree\" by Fool's Garden. Another favorite is \"Truly Madly Deeply\" by Savage Garden. Another person, Asi Tambunan, suggested the song \"God Only Knows\" by Orianthi. Gyongyi Jako wrote that ABBA's songs from Sweden are perfect for class work. Other good songs for learning English are songs by the Beatles and John Lennon, as well as Louis Armstrong's \"Wonderful World.\" Paul Cifuentes says Bob Marley's songs are amazing for teaching. Another teacher, Joseph Deka, says songs by Johnny Cash have always worked in his classroom. He says his students can hear the words, plus the songs often have stories. He also likes \"We Will Rock You\" by Queen and \"Beautiful Girls\" by Sean Kingston.  He says young children love \"C Is for Cookie\" by Cookie Monster from the TV show \"Sesame Street.\" Nina John Smith suggested these songs: \"It's My Life\" and \"We Weren't Born to Follow\" by Bon Jovi. Also \"Nothing Else Matters\" by Metallica.Aurelio Lourenco Costa Gusmao says he began to like English after his teacher played the Westlife song \"I Have a Dream.\" He wrote: That was eight years ago. I was in the seventh grade. And from that day on, my dream of improving my English skills became attached in my mind. Teachers can use this song to convey the message to their students that they should have their own dream for the future. Aurelio's story was no surprise to another commenter, Katie Kivenko.  She especially likes songs by Michael Jackson and Queen.  She wrote: When you listen to your favorite songs, you feel emotionally high and it moves you to action.For VOA Special English, I'm Alex Villarreal.

Despite its name, the honey badger does not closely resemble other badger species; instead, it bears more anatomical similarities to weasels. It is classed as Least Concern by the IUCN owing to its extensive range and general environmental adaptations. It is primarily a carnivorous species and has few natural predators because of its thick skin and ferocious defensive abilities.\n\nHoney Badger Honey Badger Honey Badger Honey Badger Honey Badger Honey Badger Honey Badger Honey Badger", "title": "Honey Badger bad", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T13:46:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "33vFdgNkePA", "description": "M\u00e1s en MeriStation http://www.meristation.com/\nS\u00edguenos en Twitter http://www.twitter.com/meristation\n\nEl popular youtuber ElRubius pone voz a Stanley en Sunset Overdrive, el esperado t\u00edtulo de Insomniac Games en exclusiva para Xbox One.

THIS TIME IT WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR ONE ISSUE THOU FOR THIS ONE WAS THE SUN WOULD BE RISING JUST AFTER THE MOON WOULD TURN RED AND I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT ANGLE TO SEE THE MOON AS IT WOULD BE CLOSE TO THE HORIZON. LUCKILY I LIVE ON A HILL THE HIGH POINT IN MY AREA. SO I WAS ABLE TO SEE IT. IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL I SAW IT GO FROM A FULL MOON WHICH HAD A BLUE AND GREENISH AURA AROUND IT FROM THE 2ND SUN I HOPE YOU ALL WERE ABLE TO NOTICE THAT AND THAT YOUR NOT BLIND OF THAT. BUT ALSO I MOVED THE MOON AROUND SINCE I KNEW PEOPLE WOULD BE WATCHING IT AND LIKELY SEE IT MOVE IF I MOVED IT SO I DID I WAS MOVING IT WHILE IT WAS STILL FULL MOSTLY AND SOME OF THE TIME WHILE IT WAS GETING MORE ECLIPSED. THEN I WAS ABLE TO WATCH IT TURN RED WHICH WAS VERY INTERESTING NEVER HAD SEEN A BLOOD MOON IN THIS LIFETIME. I THEN WENT TO A POINT WERE I WAS BARELY ABLE TO STILL SEE IT AT THE LATTER POINTS OF IT BEING RED THE SUN WAS RISING AND IT CAME UP ENOUGH TO MAKE IT SO THAT THE MOON WAS NOT VISABLE JUST AS THE MOON WAS AT THE LIMIT OF MY ABILITY TO SEE IT DUE TO IT GOING OVER THE HORIZON IN ESSENSE I WAS ON THE EXACT PART OF THE PLANET THAT WAS THE EDGE OF THE BLOCKAGE OF THE SUN'S LIGHT HITING THE MOON WHICH IS HIGHLY SYMBOLIC IT IS A SIGN OF ME BEING THE HEAD AS I AM THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE EDGE. ALSO I NOTICED I WAS AT TWO POINTS OF OBSERVATION THAT HAD SYMBOLOGIES OF THE SUN'S DISTANCE FROM EARTH AND THE MOON. THEY WERE THE DISTANCES I STOOD OBSERVING THE MOON FROM THIS PILAR RIGHT NEXT TO ME THEY WERE EQUAL IN WAY WHICH WAS THE WIDTH TO THE SIDE FROM THE PILLAR BUT THEY WERE DIFFERENT IN DISTANCE AS FAR AS HOW FAR LENGTH WISE VERY SYMBOLIC OF THE SUN AND THE MOON LOOKING THE SAME SIZE AKA THE WIDTH DISTANCE I STOOD FROM THE PILLAR AND THE PILLAR SYMBOLIZES EARTH. AND THE DIFFERENCE IN LENGTH DISTANCE I STOOD FROM THE PILLAR WAS SYMBOLIC OF THE SUN BEING FURTHER THAN THE MOON FROM EARTH. THAT PLACE WERE THE PILLAR WAS IS A INTERESTING PLACE FOR ME TO HAVE THAT OCCUR AS WELL I HAD SAT THERE BACK WHEN I WAS BECOMING AND BEING BIRTHED AS JESUS BACK AROUND OCTOBER OF 2011 WERE THIS ALL BEGAN SO THAT WAS HIGHLY AMAZINGLY SYMBOLIC I SAT THERE BECAUSE I WAS HIDING FROM A SEVERE STORM I WAS SOO NEW INTO IT ALL I WAS STILL READING THE BIBLE AND SAT THERE ALSO TO JUST HAVE A PLACE TO READ IN PEACE BECAUSE DEMONS TRY TO DISTRACT ME FROM READING THE BIBLE BACK THEN AND STILL TODAY. IT WAS AT THIS TEMPLE I GO TO. THIS RANDOM CAR CAME AND SHINED ME WITH SOME LIGHTS ON IT. THEN ONCE IT STOPED SHINING ME I NOTICED THE LIGHT IN MY EYE WAS TURNED INTO 4 LIGHTS WHICH IS ANOTHER SYMBOLOGY OF THE 4 DIFFERENT FORMS I TAKE BECOMING ONE. THEN I WENT TO HEAD OFF TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT AND I NOTICED A RED VEHICLE WAS SITING AT THE STREET EXIT OF THE TEMPLE FOR NO APPARENT REASON THE CAR BRAND WAS HIGHLY SYMBOLIC OF MY BLOOD MOTHER. I FIGURED THIS WAS ANOTHER SIGN OF MY MOTHER IN THE HEAVENS GIVING BIRTH TO ME AGAIN WHICH I TOLD YOU THIS BLOOD MOON WAS SYMBOLIC OF THE ONE BEFORE IT WAS SYMBOLIC OF MY NAMING WHICH IS 7 DAYS AFTER MY BIRTHING ON THE 8TH 8+7 IS 15 THAT IS WHY THE LAST ONE WAS ON THE 15TH THE LAST ONE WAS EVEN ON THE MONTH I WAS REBIRTHED APRIL. 7/8 7TH ISRAELI MONTH IS APRIL.

I WALKED RIGHT UP TOWARDS IT AND THEN IT DROVE OFF AS SOON AS I GOT NEAR IT THE DRIVER LOOKED LIKE THIS OLDER LADY THAT WAS THE ONE WHO KEPT ME FROM SUICIDING EARLIER IN MY WALK WITH GOD WHEN I WAS JUST BEGINING ALL CRAP HIT THE FAN FOR ME EVERYONE BETRAYED ME THE WHOLE WORLD WAS AGAINST ME AND DID NOT KNOW WHY I DID NOT CLAIM TO BE JESUS BACK THEN EITHER BUT THAT IS THE REASON THEY HATED ME AND WHY THEY STILL DO IS BECAUSE I AM JESUS.

They were signed to Fillmore Records, co-owned by producer David Rubinson and promoter Bill Graham, and toured and opened for major acts. They appeared at the Fillmore West in the last week concerts to take place there in 1971.\n\nDuring the course the recording process, Montrose's guitar work had caught the attention of Van Morrison. Rubinson arranged an audition with Morrison, who had recently moved from New York to California and needed a new band to record his next album Tupelo Honey. Montrose joined morrison and brought Bill Church with him. Both left Sawbuck but they did appear on two songs on the Sawbuck album. They were replaced by Stephen Hatley on keyboards and acoustic guitar, and bass player Nine Year and the album was released in 1972. As Edgar Winter was forming The Edgar Winter Group, which included Dan Hartman and Ronnie Montrose, Ronnie recruited Chuck Ruff which essentially ended the band Sawbuck. In 1973, Montrose and Church formed the band Montrose with Sammy Hagar and Denny Carmassi.\n\n\"Sawbuck\" was the first and only album from the band Sawbuck. The album was recorded during 1970 and 1971 and finally released in 1972. A single \"There Will Be Love\" with \"Bible Burning\" on the flip side was released in 1971.

What's 'local-level knowledge'?\nKnowledge is knowledge, it is not defined\nin terms of local or global.\nHe may refer to value, a regional value or a global one.\nHis argument has faulty wording.\"\n\nTang Baiqiao says that so far, there are said to be\nover 140 democratic countries in the world today.\n\nTang Baiqiao:\"Among nearly 200 countries in the world,\nfour-fifths have achieved democracy.\nThis fact itself proves that democracy is a universal value.\"\n\nIn recent years, the CCP trumpeter scholars have\nproduced some astonishing remarks.\n\nOn May 7, Qi Biao, an official in charge of the CCP's history\nresearch, quoted Xi Jinping in his article in the Guangming Daily.\nXi said,\"Mao Zedong cannot be negated,\nbecause that will lead to great chaos in China.\"\n\nOn May 13, the web version of the People's Daily\nprinted an article, authored by Li Shenming,\nvice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n\nLi argued that,\"It is a fake notion that over 30 million people\nwere starved to death in the Great Leap Forward period.\"\n\"No rightist was executed during the Anti-rightist Movement.\"\n\nOn May 17, Liu Xiaofeng, professor at the\nPeople's University of China(PUC), eulogized the CCP.\n\"Mao Zedong is the founding father of China, and\nthe Cultural Revolution is a democracy of the people.\"\n\nOn May 21, many official media reprinted an article\nauthored by Yang Xiaoqing, another PUC professor.\nYang wrote that \"Constitutionalism isn't fit for\nsocialist countries.\"\n\nOn May 22, the Global Times published an article,\n\"Constitutionalism is against China's Constitution.\"\nThe same day, Sun Linping, deputy chief editor of\nthe Liberation Army Daily, exclaimed in his article that:\n\"The creed of our faith is the truth of the universe.\"\n\nOutside critics say that recent ravings of\nChina's leftists show intense CCP infighting.\nBut critic Lan Shu views it differently.\n\nLan Shu:\"I don't think the CCP's left-wing and\nright-wing factions are fighting over the issue.\nThis is because both forces lack the courage to\nbreak free from the CCP.\"\n\nLan Shu indicates that the CCP has openly announced\na \"dream of Constitutionalism\".\nYet this dream is only \"with Chinese characteristics\", which\ndiffers greatly from the constitution of democratic countries.\n\nLan Shu: \"It is a Constitutionalist dream under\ncontrol or leadership of the CCP.\nAt bottom, the political system remains unchanged.\"\n\nYao Jianfu, a member of ex CCP leader Zhao Ziyang's\nthink tank, affirmed to NTD that\nthese CCP trumpeter scholars have acted\nto accommodate the CCP's wishes.\n\nYao Jianfu:\"I think they're promoting the main idea of\nthe CCP central committee's policy documents.\nIt required\"Seven Taboos\", one of them is\u2014\u2014\nDon't mention about universal values.\"\n\nIn early May, the CCP central authorities issued\na ban of \"Seven Taboos\"in higher education.\nIt banned teachers from mention of the following to\ncollege students:\nuniversal values, press freedom, civil society,\nrights of citizens,\nthe CCP's historical mistakes,\nthe privileged elite, and judicial independence.\n\n\n\n\u300a\u795e\u97f5\u300b2013\u4e16\u754c\u5de1\u6f14\u65b0\u4eae\u70b9\nhttp://www.ShenYunPerformingArts.org/", "title": "Trumpeter Scholar: Democracy Is Local-Level Knowledge", "publishedDate": "2013-05-31T01:47:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "34CJNuTD1C8", "description": "Alternation of Generation of ferns made by Spencer Duckworth, Li'ana, Jesus", "title": "Alternation Of Generation", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06T23:06:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "34CK576fFkU", "description": "PC's 1st music video, staring Traci Michaelz, Macy Malone, Eddie Electra, Andii Stitttch, Ericka & Crystal and some awesome friends & fans!

Strimmer string line cords create pollution when left on the grounds around our gardens and public parks.\n\nWhat the public has to realize is that nylon, formerly touted as \"miracle fiber\", has been proven as an environmental pollutant. Its true producing nylon string strimmer line cords alone involves the heavy use of adipic acid. A report by www.worldwatch.org attributes the release of harmful nitrous to this acid. Moreover, nylons release toxic chemicals such as hydrogen cyanide and diamine, which are the same compounds used when producing  string trimmer line cords.\n\nIf left lying around, the flora and fauna will suffer from its effects badly. Such as in the case of organic farming, this method becomes unacceptable with all the harmful chemicals that can be released into the organic plantation. Aside from that the chemicals, this toxic material is also non-recyclable since it's a plastic that cannot be broken down. Well not in our lifetime as I think i found on line many reports that state it can take anywhere from 600 years to 800 years for any trimmer string line ( Monofilament Nylon cords).\n\nAnother alarming issue when using String Line Trimming maintenance is the safety of people around an operator working a string trimmer line head, whether it's at home or in public it is a very danger practice these days.. A report by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSM) revealed that no less than 230,000 people suffer from injuries caused by lawn maintenance equipment including trimmer string line cords. \n\nFor anyone concerned about the safety of their loves ones, this safety information video is shared merely to create awareness of the dangers of using any garden tools and also to share other options which are openly available on the market place that offer a better safer more ergonomic solution to help keep our loves one safe and keep our environment cleaner and safer to walk around during high lawn care mowing season.\n\nIndividual and landscaping business owners alike are taking safety guideline information into consideration these days more than ever before. If you wish to avoid costly lawsuits that can easily bring down the business. Whether you are using a string trimmer line weed  wacker at home or for service maintenance, it is time to make a change and lead your industry by example by choosing an alternative to trimmer string line cords.\n\nIf you think there is no better solution available?

Henry Fillmore himself was a great entertainer, the last minstrelmen. In  1938, he moved to Miami, Florida to retire after being diagnosed with a heart ailment.

If they are lucky, current will flow from the cloud, through the wire, to the ground, and vaporize the wire.

On this particular dark and stormy afternoon in Florida, most of the wire exploded. But a second bolt, which burst from where the top of the wire had been, took a circuitous route, fracturing into multiple branches as it approached ground, said William Gamerota, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Florida and lead author of the paper about this uncommon event.

When 2010 saw their first EP for Made to Play \u201aCalypso' get signed on the spot by label boss Jesse Rose and become one of the catchiest label outputs to date, we knew to expect more than just elevated quality and boundary pushing house music. Never delivering an output that could be considered \u201atypical', their chivalrous kudos as remixers was also duly noted with projects on Gomma and Defected, thus turning some serious heads. Not to forget of course, their mas- sive remix of Tensnake's \u201aComa Cat' which went on to become Pete Tong's \u201aEssential New Tune'.\n\nTheir forthcoming debut artist album \u201aSay What?!' on Made To Play reflects just this, ranging from pop, electro, disco, dub, jazz, garage, swing... all united under the feeling that is house. As the 12th century \u201aRound Table' theory suggests, each that sits at it, does so in equal measures.\n\nFor the album and album sampler's title track 'Say What?!\" Ogris Debris's introspective vocal talents are drafted in, two (as Poker Flat label don Steve Bug puts it) \u201acrazy' guys from Austria, who are already one step ahead of the game with release on labels such as: Compost Black Label, Rotary Cocktail and Estrela.\n\nThe Ogris Debris boys jump in again on remix duties delivering a absolutely massive version for the club. \n\nCompleting this tantalising preview to the album is 'Cat Power',  a sub level groover interlaced with a soulfully intoxicating vocal that, unsurprisingly, already has some serious support with the big names on the underground.\n\nWith \u201aSay What?!' the boys have created one of the freshest and most fun hybrids of 2011, with a free mind and the skills to back it up. Upcoming projects also include a remix of Jesse Rose's \u201aNon-Stop' on Made to Play and remixes for Gomma, Modular and Loungin' Recordings.\nLinks:\n\nhttp://www.roundtableknights.ch\n\nhttp://www.ogrisdebris.com/\n\nhttp://www.madetoplay.net\n\nhttp://www.foederation.ch", "title": "Round Table Knights feat.

Tidak ada yang mengetahui keberadaan kamar itu, sampai Houdin menyadari adanya salah satu elemen batu di ruangan yang tidak menopang apapun, dan mungkin dulunya adalah jalanan.\n\nDalam upacara pemakaman Mesir kuno, raja dikubur bersama semua harta bendanya dalam jarak dekat. Dalam piramida lain, benda-benda ini terletak di ruangan di sebelah kuburan.\n\n[Jean-Pierre Houdin, Arsitek Perancis]:\n\"Kami umumkan, bahwa di dalam Piramida Khufu ada dua ruang tunggu yang merupakan bagian dari kamar pemakaman Khufu. Kamar ini belum pernah diketahui dan sangat dekat dengan kamar raja.\"\n\nPintu masuk piramida yang digunakan pengunjung saat ini, dibuka pada 820 Masehi oleh Khalifah Al-Mamoun yang ingin mencari harta karun Khufu. Tapi dia tak tahu kalau pintu masuk ke kamar raja yang sebenarnya sangat dekat.\n\n[Jean-Pierre Houdin, Arsitek Perancis]:\n\"Sejarah hanya mengatakan perampok masuk melalui pintu, terus sampai ke kamar Raja lalu keluar. Sebenarnya Mamoun menemukan koridor yang salah. Koridor yang benar dan ruang tunggu berada di belakangnya. Sekarang kita harus menemukannya. Dan tidak sulit untuk mencarinya sekarang.\"\n\nTeori sebelumnya menganggap makam Firaun Khufu dibangun dari luar ke dalam, dengan landaian besar atau landaian spiral di bagian depan, untuk mengangkat bebatuan.\n\nJean-Pierre Houdin berkata, teknologi 3D telah menunjukkan jalan utama untuk mengangkat batu besar ke puncak, berada sekitar 10-15 meter di bawah dinding luar, menelusuri piramida dalam piramida.

As the plane touched down, Kurylo got hit on the head by a propeller from the plane.\n\nPassengers heard a bang during takeoff. The crew then announced that one of the tires from the landing gear had burst, and that the flight was being diverted to Edmonton for an emergency landing. The flight made it to Edmonton, but when the landing gear extended, passengers noticed a basketball-sized hole in one of the tires.\n\nWhen the plane touched down, the landing gear collapsed. Passengers heard the plane scraping the ground, saw sparks flying and smelled burning steal. Kurylo was sitting in her seventh row seat when a propeller from the plane came crashing through her window.  \n\n\u201cI'm really lucky,\u201d Kurylo told Canada\u2019s Global News, \u201cIt could have been a million times worse.\u201d\n\nFour passengers were hospitalized with minor injuries.

Nevertheless, because of the Moorish occupation of the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages, and the participation of Portugal in the Age of Discovery, it has adopted loanwords from all over the world.\nVery few Portuguese words can be traced to the pre-Roman inhabitants of Portugal, which included the Gallaeci, Lusitanians, Celtici and Cynetes. The Phoenicians and Carthaginians, briefly present, also left some scarce traces. Some notable examples are ab\u00f3bora \"pumpkin\" and bezerro \"year-old calf\", from the nearby Celtiberian language (probably through the Celtici); cerveja \"beer\", from Celtic; through Latin \"cervisia.\"\nIn the 5th century, the Iberian Peninsula (the Roman Hispania) was conquered by the Germanic Suebi and Visigoths. As they adopted the Roman civilization and language, however, these people contributed only a few words to the lexicon, mostly related to warfare\u2014such as espora \"spur\", estaca \"stake\", and guerra \"war\", from Gothic *spa\u00fara, *stakka, and *wirro, respectively. The influence also exists in toponymic surnames and patronymic surnames borne by Visigoth sovereigns and their descendants, and it dwells on placenames such has Ermesinde, Esposende and Resende where sinde and sende are derived from the Germanic \"sinths\" (military expedition) and in the case of Resende, the prefix re comes from Germanic \"reths\" (council).\nBetween the 9th and 13th centuries, Portuguese acquired about 900 words from Arabic by influence of Moorish Iberia. They are often recognizable by the initial Arabic article a(l)-, and include many common words such as aldeia \"village\" from \u0627\u0644\u0636\u064a\u0639\u0629 al\u1e0dai`a (or from Edictum Rothari: aldii, aldias),[80] alface \"lettuce\" from \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0633 alkhass, armaz\u00e9m \"warehouse\" from \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u0632\u0646 almakhzan, and azeite \"olive oil\" from \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a azzait. From Arabic came also the grammatically peculiar word oxal\u00e1 \u0625\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \"hopefully\". The Mozambican currency name metical was derived from the word \u0645\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644 mitq\u0101l, a unit of weight. The word Mozambique itself is from the Arabic name of sultan Mu\u00e7a Alebique (Musa Alibiki).\nStarting in the 15th century, the Portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from Asian languages. For instance, catana \"cutlass\" from Japanese katana and ch\u00e1 \"tea\" from Chinese ch\u00e1.\nFrom South America came batata \"potato\", from Taino; anan\u00e1s and abacaxi, from Tupi--Guarani nan\u00e1 and Tupi ib\u00e1 cati, respectively (two species of pineapple), and tucano \"toucan\" from Guarani tucan.\n\nPortuguese language schools\nPortuguese language software\nPortuguese language training\nPortuguese lesson\nPortuguese lessons\nPortuguese names\nPortuguese online\nPortuguese phrases\nPortuguese school\nPortuguese software\nPortuguese translate\nPortuguese translation\nPortuguese translations\nPortuguese translator\nPortuguese tutor\nPortuguese vocabulary\nPortuguese words\nPortuguese writing\nlearn basic Portuguese\nlearn how to speak Portuguese\nlearn Portuguese\nstudy Portuguese\nstudy Portuguese language\nteach me Portuguese", "title": "Portuguese lessons for beginners Learn Vocabulary", "publishedDate": "2013-12-14T09:31:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "34m4CtTIFWI", "description": "The Doric String Quartet performs the finale from Haydn's String Quartet in F Minor, Op. 20 No. 5 as an encore\n\n4th Movement - Finale.

With this screen printing exposure unit you are able to burn higher quality and crisper images vs. using an above exposure light or the sun.\n\nHow? This table top exposure unit uses unfiltered UV black light which exposes a screen much faster than halogen or photo light. Also by using the foam pad that comes with the unit and about 25 lbs of weight you can create the positive pressure needed to sandwich your film positive and screen mesh to the exposure glass to ensure that fine detail, halftones and crisp edges can be exposed without light working its way around the edge of the image like it would if positive contact was not sufficient.\n\nIf you\u2019re an entry level, DIY or startup screen printer you don't need to spend thousands of dollars on a vacuum unit in order to expose fine detail and high quality images.

The VSI crushers utilize velocity rather than surface force as the predominant force to break rock. In its natural state, rock has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force (pressure) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubical resulting particles. Utilizing velocity rather than surface force allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both across the surface of the rock as well as through the mass of the rock. Rock, regardless of size, has natural fissures (faults) throughout its structure. As rock is 'thrown' by a VSI Rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along these fissures. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the rock is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI Crushing is generally of a consistent cubical shape such as that required by modern SUPERPAVE highway asphalt applications. Using this method also allows materials with much higher abrasiveness to be crushed than is capable with an HSI and most other crushing methods.\n\n These are spinflow conveyors based on the principle of whirlpools.

Whizzing around the streets of Berlin - this is the \"ErockIT\". Half-bicycle, half-motorbike, Stefan Gulas has been working on his invention for the past four years:\n\n[Stefan Gulas, ErockIT Inventor]:\n\"It's a motorbike and in a certain sense it's also a bicycle, because the motorbike works as a bicycle. So you have to pedal in order to travel forwards. The pedals act as a type of accelerator. So you don't have an accelerator on the handlebars but you have to pedal. And the quicker you pedal the faster the motor goes.\"\n\nAnd this pedaling also charges up the bike's battery. Gulas is convinced the ErockIT - which can travel up to 80 kilometers, or almost 50 miles an hour, is a transport revolution.\n\n[Stefan Gulas, ErockIT Inventor]:\n\"The thing I'm most proud of is that we've managed to make a cool electric vehicle. There are lots of vehicles with petrol engines that are cool - you just need to go and take a look at them, Ducatis or cars like Porsches and Ferraris. They're cool vehicles, but they all have petrol engines.\"\n\nThe bike may have the looks. But it seems people don't quite know what to make of it.\n\n[Martin Alridge, Likes ErockIT]:\n\"From the speed, I'd say it's a motorbike, but he pedals it, so it's a push bike. So it's a bicycle. But an amazing thing, absolutely amazing. I want one.\"\n\nThe others who want one should be prepared to dig deep into their pockets.\n\nAn \"ErockIT\" costs 30-thousand euros - or around 44-thousand U.S. dollars - and customers have to put down 25 000 euros when they place an order.\n\nFor his part - Gulas says he expects the bike will appeal to creative, successful, people.", "title": "Super fast bike could revolutionize transportation", "publishedDate": "2009-01-28T21:08:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "34rCeDjhVYU", "description": "Dirt bike into Arizona rim country end at Knoll lake", "title": "Knoll lake arizona rim", "publishedDate": "2012-06-05T01:22:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "34s7xSX2vLQ", "description": "Poetry (from the Greek poiesis \u2014 \u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u2014 with a broad meaning of a \"making\", seen also in such terms as \"hemopoiesis\"; more narrowly, the making of poetry) is a form of literary art which uses aesthetic and rhythmic[1][2][3] qualities of language\u2014such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre\u2014to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.\nPoetry has a long history, dating back to the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh. Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "A Glimpse by Walt Whitman", "publishedDate": "2013-07-26T22:41:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "34sXNHdVpZI", "description": "Dekoracja pizza pizza,dekorowanie potraw,carving,przepis,przepisy\nMoje najlepsze przepisy.\nNajlepszy przepis na kotlet de volaille \nfilmy kulinarne przepisy na kurczaka obiad kolacje\nhttp://youtu.be/bXu7k1kgldA\nPrzepis ryba ryby rybki sma\u017cenie jak sma\u017cy\u0107 ryby filmy \nkulinarne przepisy na ryb\u0119 obiad kolacje\nhttp://youtu.be/XgSDBuQlM6w\nPrzepis-Dekoracja potraw kwiatki kompozycja-filmy kulinarne\nhttp://youtu.be/cMjyiEfoOl4\nPrzepis rolada galantyna z kurczaka filmy kulinarne przepisy \nna obiad \u015bniadanie kolacje\nhttp://youtu.be/nLVXg-9r0S8\nP\u00f3\u0142miski mi\u0119s-filmy kulinarne\nhttp://youtu.be/_BrLR7JsG8c\nPrzepis grzyby boczniaki panierowane filmy kulinarne przepisy \nna obiad \u015bniadanie kolacje\nhttp://youtu.be/3BoBoGNLjqM\nDekoracja dekorowanie dekoracja z zielonej pory kwiatek filmy \nkulinarne przepisy na obiad\nhttp://youtu.be/vkrR_g5kPYI\nPrzepis barszcz czerwony zabielany filmy kulinarne przepisy\nhttp://youtu.be/u4jCYuEA0TI\nPrzepis kapu\u015bniak z kiszonej kapusty z ziemniakami filmy \nkulinarne przepisy na obiad\nhttp://youtu.be/k_8yAIiI7NI\nPrzepis krokiety z mi\u0119sem na obiad\nhttp://youtu.be/jg5wc5ASRH4\nPrzepis bar Barbara \u015awidnicka krokiety z kapust\u0105 i grzybami filmy \nkulinarne przepisy na obiad\nhttp://youtu.be/lOhcvrOXo0k\nPrzepis-Obiad kasza jaglana-filmy kulinarne przepisy\nhttp://youtu.be/CQxU1BJyU20\nKotlety mielone domowe na obiad\nhttp://youtu.be/RjGA8P5Ue2o\nPrzepis kluski \u015bl\u0105skie filmy kulinarne przepisy na obiad\nhttp://youtu.be/Os5JB0MymLI\nPrzepis schab pieczony ze \u015bliwkami i morelami::obiady przepisy-filmy kulinarne\nhttp://youtu.be/HWeek739PwY\nCiasto-jab\u0142ecznik na kruchym cie\u015bcie,obiady przepisy,\ndeser-filmy kulinarne przepis\nhttp://youtu.be/vhVd01in_VA\nPrzepis go\u0142\u0105bki ry\u017c mi\u0119so  sos pomidorowy filmy kulinarne \nprzepisy na obiad \u015bniadanie kolacje\nhttp://youtu.be/559phZErWLc\nPierogi z kapust\u0105 i grzybami ciasto farsz na obiad\nhttp://youtu.be/tptZ0dzQmOg\nPrzepis tanie gotowanie  bia\u0142y ser filmy kulinarne przepisy na\n twaro\u017cek kolacje \u015bniadanie obiad\nhttp://youtu.be/gdHHUiFiU34\nDekoracja marchewk\u0105 kwiatek\nhttp://youtu.be/SWNbcRjZit8\nDekoracje potraw\nhttp://youtu.be/B5QOgQTZA2c\nPrzepis jak zrobi\u0107 gulasz filmy kulinarne przepisy \nna obiad \u015bniadanie kolacje\nhttp://youtu.be/6dL5zk9pyA4\nCiasto dro\u017cd\u017cowe z truskawkami i kruszonk\u0105 przepis \nfilmy kulinarne przepisy na ciasta\nhttp://youtu.be/vT8oh10pmLo\nPrzepis bar Barbara Wroc\u0142aw \u015awidnicka w\u0105tr\u00f3bka wieprzowa z cebul\u0105 \nfilmy kulinarne przepisy\nhttp://youtu.be/L_ReJdAVN0g\nPrzepis sos grzybowy filmy kulinarne przepisy na sosy\nhttp://youtu.be/-55GN5WElQM\nPrzepis karczek duszony sos filmy kulinarne przepisy \nna obiad \u015bniadanie kolacje\nhttp://youtu.be/-FpLYhu-kBc\nPrzepis pierogi z mi\u0119sem ciasto farsz domowe  filmy kulinarne \nprzepisy na obiad \u015bniadanie kolacje\nhttp://youtu.be/Mz4WLLkFfYs\nPrzepis galantyna rolada  z kurczaka filmy kulinarne przepisy na obiad\nhttp://youtu.be/TXwv95CTBJA\nPrzepis jak zrobi\u0107 pierogi z mi\u0119sem ciasto farsz \nfilmy kulinarne przepisy na obiad\nhttp://youtu.be/wZwbnZEGVoM", "title": "Przepis dekoracja kwiatek marchew,pietruszka z barszczu filmy kulinarne przepisy dekorowanie", "publishedDate": "2012-11-17T11:35:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "34srPrdL4lA", "description": "Cool Ice Cube Molds http://www.coolpeopleshop.com/top-10-cool-shot-glasses/\n\nDrinking has evolved as ages passed, and it has gone from a luxury to a habit to an art, where the ambience and mood of the drinker is set by his favored poison and company.

One Georgia firm is investigating the company over concerns about development and sales performance statements, while the legal team behind the Enron lawsuit has begun another lawsuit against the publishing giant.\n\nRobbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against EA. The details of complaint suggest that members of the company issued, \"materially false and misleading statements\" regarding Battlefield 4. As a direct result of these statements, EA's share value reached a high during that period allowing certain executives to sell their shares at an inflated price.\n\nThe lawsuit also mentions the PS4 version of the game which has suffered numerous issues like server errors and various bugs and glitches, and how statements made from EA about this issues affected stock prices.\n\nThe goal of the law firm is to receive damages on behalf of everyone who purchased EA common stock during the class period. It is important to note that this lawsuit hasn't officially been filed, as a lead plaintiff has not been named. There is a deadline of February 15th, 2014.\n\nEA told GameSpot, \"We believe these claims are meritless. We intend to aggressively defend ourselves, and we're confident the court will dismiss the complaint in due course.\"\n\nSource Link: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/class-action-lawsuit-commenced-over-buggy-battlefield-4-ea-calls-it-meritless-update/1100-6416790/\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EscapistMag\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/TheEscapistMag\nFind us Google+: http://bit.ly/EscapistGoogle\nFollow us on Pinterest: http://bit.ly/EscapistPins\nCheck out our Merch: http://www.splitreason.com/theescapist", "title": "BF4 CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT (Escapist News Now)", "publishedDate": "2013-12-19T19:16:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "34ur18O9ZyA", "description": "simple demo of how to flush your plants by Greenhouse Gangstas", "title": "How to flush Marijuana plants before harvest", "publishedDate": "2009-10-28T20:35:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "34w-2sV8bbg", "description": "http://www.CookBookMix.com\n\nThis is the summary of Prairie Home Breads: 150 Splendid Recipes from America's Breadbasket (Non) by Judith M.

Metals are on the left of the periodic table, while nonmetals are located on the right. Some in the middle are called metalloids because they have characteristics of both metals and nonmetals. The periodic table is purposely arranged into vertical classifications called groups. Columns of elements help define element groups. Some of the notable groups of elements include the noble gases (column 18), the halogens (column 17), the alkali metals (column 1) and the alkaline earth metals (column 2). The transition metals are located in the center of the periodic table. They include many of the common metals, such as copper, iron, silver and gold. The two rows below the main body of the table are called the lanthanide and actinide series. They include the very heavy metallic elements, such as uranium and plutonium. This program goes in depth regarding the elements potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) and their roles in the health of the human body. Potassium helps to control the proper balance of fluids in cells, helps with the contraction of muscles, and is involved in the transmission of chemical messages between nerve cells. Potassium aids in digestion of food, and in the proper function of the eyes. Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body.

Charlie Sheen's infamous Radio Rant with Alex Jones -- Charlie is clearly being coached during his phone interview by his publicist, Nigel Bramley.  \n\nCharlie Sheen called into a nationally syndicated radio show on Thursday and unleashed a shocking rant in which he attacked Alcoholics Anonymous and Chuck Lorre, the creator of his hit CBS show, \"Two and a Half Men.\"\n\nCharlie later took his Crazy to Good Morning America and The Today Show.\n\nwith Greg Benson http://www.youtube.com/mediocrefilms2\nand Joseph Limbaugh http://www.youtube.com/sharkytrue\n\nMusic provided by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com\nDirector of Photography: Greg Checchi\nSpecial thanks to Kim Evey & Kari McGee\n\nGOT QUESTIONS FOR ME!? ASK ME HERE AND I'LL ANSWER IN A VIDEO JUST FOR YOU!!! :)\nhttp://www.vyou.com/gregbenson\n\nBelow is the actual radio transcript (excerpted):\n\nCharlie Sheen: ... Let's get to more ... you know ... contemporary stuff, 'cause just what's going on ... and people are so ... you know ... mystified by this odyssey that refuses to stop calling itself 'Charlie Sheen'.  You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. No, you won't get high .... It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.\n\nJones: Oh, we're live. Charlie ... speaking of that, the media ... you don't want to go there. You don't ever want to defend yourself, but you've told me privately that most of the stuff ... most of the names ... it's not true. But what is going on with the women in your life?\n\nSheen: The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .... Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right?\n\nSheen: So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.\n\nSheen: THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! .... And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So ....\n\nSheen: No. She's not there now. And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .... (long silence) .... Rhymes with winning? .... Anyone? .... Yeah, that would be us.\n\nI think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... you know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .... And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and .... (sighs) You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, \"I CAN'T PROCESS IT!\" Well, no, and you never will.

Emperors of the night, gathered in a circle, surrounded by ancient tombs and crumbling thrones.\"\n\nAmidst the frost - laden solace of winter's inevitable eminence, Wintersoul commands the days of cold, sweeping over the lands, burying all in an invocation worthy of freezing over hell. Armed to the frostbitten jaws with mercilessness, death, and the foreshadowing bane of the frigid season to come, this UK ice - cold legion have finally unveiled their long - awaited full length debut \"Frozen Storm Apocalypse\" available on Nokternal Hemizphear. Comprised of members from the likes of Ashen Mortality and Clemency, these hearts of arctic fury relentlessly impale your soul to massive ice walls of thrashy, chilling black metal sound with stakes of numbing permafrost technicalities.\n\nImmensely epic atmospheres of haunting clean female vocals and tenacious growls envelop the sheer essence of ripping guitars and blistering percussions. The moonlight gale of the nocturnal night eclipse wanes in majestic horror at the arrival of arguably the most terrifying black winter metal creation since Immortal's \"Battles in the North\" and \"At the Heart of Winter\". Telling of a disastrous global blizzard where the masses transform into 'ice hearts' imprecating the torrents of evil ritual, to lay low the lands under a shroud of darkness, the hordes of the frozen dead seek to reap the souls from the few whom rebel amidst the blinding fury of the ultimate winter storm.\n\nUniquely different from, yet similarly fashioned to the likes of Immortal, Imperial Crystalline Entombment, Immortal Souls, Absu, Antestor, Behemoth, Crimson Moonlight, Melechesh, and Legion of the Damned. Envision Immortal colliding with Kreator in a frozen mass of cataclysmic white injected with steroids! Think Imperial Crystalline Entombment doused with the essence of November's Doom and you have just begun to scratch the surface of Wintersoul. Only those of a pure winter holocaust soul dare enter the terrorizing glorious realm of Wintersoul where a \"Frozen Storm Apocalypse\" resides with chaos, depravation, and misaligned beauty...\n\n\"Under the screen of darkened skies, the black seeds of chaos grow. This cold world lies deep inside me; Brooding within my severed veins. As the thorns of winter pierce my skin.\"\n\nLyrics from \"Shades of Terror\" and \"Thorns of Winter\"\n\n- Nokternal Hemizphear", "title": "Wintersoul - Dawn of Ice Heart.", "publishedDate": "2010-12-17T01:28:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "35L6XDtClHU", "description": "Don Asplin is proud to present this stunning Willetton High & Rostrata Primary School Zoned 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom family home.

Its patented design means you only boil one cup at a time saving time, money and energy.\nThe Hot Cup's 1.5 litre illuminating water tank\n1.5 litre illuminating water tank\nThe Hot Cup's easy to work on button\nBoiled water at the touch of a button\nPouring water into the Hot Cup's removable water tank\nEasy to fill water tank works just like a kettle\nThe Hot Cup's detachable drip tray in action\nSave on spills with the detachable drip tray\nBoiling water in an instant\n\nThe Breville Hot Cup is designed to boil a cup of water in a matter of seconds, meaning great hot drinks at the touch of a button. It dispenses a 250 millilitre (ml) cup of boiling water--the equivalent of a standard drinking mug--and will dispense up to five cups without refilling--perfect for families or small offices.\n\nThe innovative patented technology ensures that water is only dispensed once it has reached boiling point, not simply very warm, but 100 degrees Celsius, making perfect hot drinks every time. In addition, the smooth and continuous flow of water keeps any splashing to a minimum.\n\nBy only boiling enough water for the number of cups you need, the Hot Cup is economical and energy efficient. There's no boiled water going to waste and it helps you save pennies on electricity bills.\n\nEasy to use and easy to clean\n\nThe Breville Hot Cup features a fast boil 3 kilowatt (kW) concealed element which delivers maximum efficiency and keeps the water tank easy to clean. The 1.5 litre (l) capacity water tank is also easy to fill thanks to its lid release button. Press the button down to open and then fill the water tank with fresh, cold water just like you would a kettle.\n\nThe extra-large rear water window helps you accurately fill the water tank and once filled, you can place the it back on the base facing any angle as it's 360 degree (\u00b0) rotational. This means you don't have to line it up in a certain place to function.\n\nIllumination on boil gives a blue hue\n\nWhen activated, the tank illuminates to give a stylish blue glow to your kitchen. This modern design makes the Hot Cup a sophisticated addition to your kitchen worktop. And it continues to look good even when not in use thanks to its gloss black finish with smart stainless steel trim.\n\nMess is kept to a minimum as the drip tray at the base of the unit collects all stray spillages. It's easily removable for cleaning and is dishwasher safe. Also doing its bit to help keep your kitchen workspace tidy is the cord storage. This coils loose and unused cord under the base of the unit so that it's not swamping your kitchen and taking up unwanted space and the base itself is non- slip so you don't have to worry about it slipping on your work surface.\n\nBreville is the leading brand of small home kitchen appliances in the UK, with a hugely successful range of products across the spectrum of kitchen appliances including kettles, toasters, irons, blenders, food processors, microwaves and many others. Breville's success is driven by innovation and design, as well as a determination to provide great looking, high quality products that meet the demands of every kitchen in the country.\n\nhttp://www.alliwantreviews.info/brevilleVKJ142", "title": "Breville VKJ142 Hot Cup", "publishedDate": "2014-08-03T20:48:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "35V7vrU3UGk", "description": "Bitches and Whores.", "title": "Roleplay Trolling as Adachi on Persona 4 Arena Ultimax #1 (P4AU PS3)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-29T11:00:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "35VcoSMh_ZE", "description": "UFC flyweight John Dodson enters the Octagon for his title bout against Demetrious Johnson.\n\nMusic: Kid Next Door - Children of the Night", "title": "John Dodson UFC on Fox 6 Walkout", "publishedDate": "2013-07-25T03:30:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "35W3Zmv4Jy0", "description": "Buy this release online:\nhttp://www.djshop.de/Download/ex/s~details,u~10055644,p1~mp3/xe/details.html\nDistributed by http://www.feiyr.com\nArtist: Vladimir Hirsch\nTitle: A Chess Game Trespass\nLabel: Lba Composers\nDate: 2013-04-20\nStyle: Jazz\nID: 10195212\nISRC: US8FK1300056\n\nThis video was published on YouTube with the authorization of Lba Composers.

Fig. 1 shows the basic Colpitts circuit, where two capacitors and one inductor determine the frequency of oscillation. The feedback needed for oscillation is taken from a voltage divider made of two capacitors, whereas in the Hartley oscillator the feedback is taken from a voltage divider made of two inductors (or a single, tapped inductor).\nAs with any oscillator, the amplification of the active component should be marginally larger than the attenuation of the capacitive voltage divider, to obtain stable operation. Thus, a Colpitts oscillator used as a variable frequency oscillator (VFO) performs best when a variable inductance is used for tuning, as opposed to tuning one of the two capacitors. If tuning by variable capacitor is needed, it should be done via a third capacitor connected in parallel to the inductor (or in series as in the Clapp oscillator).\nFig.shows an often preferred variant, where the inductor is also grounded (which makes circuit layout easier for higher frequencies). Note that feedback energy is fed into the connection between the two capacitors. This amplifier provides current, not voltage, amplification.\nISIS Schematic Capture - a tool for entering designs.\nPROSPICE Mixed mode SPICE simulation - industry standard SPICE3F5 simulator combined with a digital simulator.\nARES PCB Layout - PCB design system with automatic component placer, rip-up and retry auto-router and interactive design rule checking.\nVSM - Virtual System Modelling lets cosimulate embedded software for popular micro-controllers alongside hardware design.\nSystem Benefits Integrated package with common user interface and fully context sensitive help.\nProteus is software for microprocessor simulation, schematic capture, and printed circuit board (PCB) design.

A sharp drop in its imports - or in the value of the dollar - can spell doom for more than one country and more than a couple of industries. The USA being the global economy's sink of last resort - absorbing one quarter of world trade - other countries have an interest to maintain and encourage American extravagance. Countries with large exports to the USA are likely to reacts with tariffs, quotas, and competitive devaluations to any change in the status quo. The IMF couches the awareness of a growing global addiction in its usual cautious terms:\n\n\"The possibility of an abrupt and disruptive adjustment in the U.S. dollar remains a concern, for both the United States and the rest of the world ... The question is not whether the U.S. deficit will be sustained at present levels forever - it will not - but more when and how the eventual adjustment takes place ... While this would likely be manageable in the short term it could adversely affect the sustainability of recovery later on.\"\n\nAnother embarrassing truth is that a strong recovery in Europe or Japan may deplete the pool of foreign capital available to the USA. German and Japanese Investors may prefer to plough their money into a re-emergent Germany, or a re-awakening Japan - especially if the dollar were to plunge. America requires more than $1 billion a day to maintain its current levels of government spending, consumption, and investment.\n\nThere is another - much hushed - aspect of American indebtedness. It provides other trading blocks and countries - for example, Japan and the oil producing countries - with geopolitical leverage over the United States and its policies. America - forced to dedicate a growing share of its national income to debt repayment - is \"in growing hock\" to its large creditors.", "title": "US Profligacy Encouraged", "publishedDate": "2013-11-15T15:02:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "35mZqkQ-q7o", "description": "Subscribe for FREE \u25ba http://bit.ly/YourHowToDo\n\nHow to do \"Ronaldinho Flick Up / Pendulum\" in freestyle football / soccer.\n\nCheck out our channel for more tutorials :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/YourHowToDo\n\nOur Other Channels:\n---------------------------\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/YourHowToGame", "title": "Ronaldinho Flick / Pendulum (Tutorial) :: Freestyle Football / Soccer", "publishedDate": "2012-02-21T22:14:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "35mt7JKinDw", "description": "In the second it took this rider to be distracted and wave to a friend, he was immediately thrown off his bike and onto the gravel.

Made with only the finest and most innovative materials, FuzziBunz diapers deter icky leaks, prevent painful diaper rash and keep baby looking and feeling good.\n\nWhen choosing the right cloth diaper for your baby, there is a lot to think about.  One major choice today is choosing a One Size diaper or a Sized diaper.  Use the chart below to help decide whether a One Size or Sized diaper is right for you and your baby.\n\nIf a trim fitting diaper is important to you, then the Sized diapers may be best suited for you - most babies use only 2 sizes of diapers, Small and Medium.  If a diaper that will last from birth to potty, and will stand up to three years of use or more is what you value (and you are willing to sacrifice some trimness for this), then the One Size may be your diaper of choice. \n\nThe FuzziBunz One Size Diapers are the most adjustable and innovative one-size cloth diapers on the market today! Adjust the diapers to fit babies 7-35 pounds and get a snug fit every time with the button-adjusted waist and leg casings. The leg casings adjust to 8+ settings and the waist adjusts to 4+ settings. Never before has a pocket-style cloth diaper been SO adjustable!\n\nIncludes\n- FuzziBunz One Size diaper with hip snaps (1 each)\n- Absorbent cotton 4 layer inserts (2 each Small, 2 each Medium/Large)\n- Replacement Elastic - Bonus (2 each)\n\nFeatures\n- Sturdy Snap Closures Make FuzziBunz the Hands-Down Cloth Diaper Winner!\n- Award-winning patented pocket diaper is made with sturdy snap closures, which are made to last and require absolutely no maintenance. \n- Has no Velcro, so it won't fray, collect lint or snag your baby's clothes. \n- Snaps at the waist, hips, and legs for a perfect fit.\n- Adjustable, stretchy leg elastic with mini-gussets keeps messes contained.\n- Durable snap closures never give out, guaranteed.\n- Patented inside fleece layer keeps your baby dry and rash free.\n- Super absorbent insert is hidden in a patented back pocket.\n- Waterproofing built in with soft PUL outer layer which comes in a rainbow of fashionable colors.\n\nOne Size Adjustability\nThe FuzziBunz One Size diaper is adjustable through adjustable elastic, NOT snap downs on the front of the diaper like most one size diapers on the market today. Similar to adjustable waistbands for children and maternity wear, the waist and legs have been made customizable through a button / elastic adjustment system. So instead of 3 length settings, you can set to 8+ very customizable sizes. Instead of NO waist settings, you have up to 4+. So you have a SUPER adjustable diaper without an excess of snaps. It may take a bit of adjusting to get to the right size, but when you find the right fit, you set it and forget it.\n\nFuzziBunz diapers are the workhorse of all reusable diapering systems. Made with only the finest and most innovative materials, the stylish three-layered patented FuzziBunz design works hard to keep your babies' bottoms dry and rash-free always!\n\nHow does the FuzziBunz diapering system work\n- The waterproof outer barrier keeps wetness contained. \n- The soft microfleece inner layer gently touches your babys skin, pulling away moisture and keeping your baby rash-free, dry, and comfortable. The microfleece is made of 100% Polyester and is custom-milled. \n- The unique, patented pocket-style opening enables you to customize the absorbency to fit your baby needs. Stuff the pocket with inserts, a pre-fold, or even a hand towel! \n- The updated top-stitching circles the top of the diaper and the tabs, providing reinforcement and demonstrating commitment to making high quality diapers that hold up wash after wash. \n- The larger, square tabs hold the diaper in place to prevent sagging and provide better grip during diaper changes. \n- The stretchier elastic around the legs provides maximum comfort for baby.  \n- The leg casings create \"mini-gussets\" to keep messes contained and leaks at bay. \n- The adjustable snap settings grow with your baby and enable you to adjust for your babys waist and leg sizes. \n- The wide-array of color choices makes diapering fun!", "title": "FuzziBunz One Size Cloth Diaper", "publishedDate": "2010-05-09T21:06:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "35pvLqmJvEI", "description": "Built in 1776, the gunboat Philadelphia is the oldest American fighting vessel in existence.

Each screw makes contact with a small post attached at the back of the laser diode.  Turning the screw presses on this post and changes the direction of the laser beam. Allen head wrenches are included with every new Crimson Trace Lasergrip.\n\nThe Allen head screw at the top changes the elevation (the up or down of the laser movement).  The screw on the side allows you to adjust the windage (side movement from left to right).  Keep in mind, a little adjustment goes a long way.  It is recommended that you make adjustments in no more than quarter-turn increments. \n\n- Step One -- Sighting To Iron Sights\n\nThe first step to sighting in your Lasergrips is to establish a proper sight picture.  That is to align to top of your front sight with the top of your rear sight while having an equal amount of light on either side of the front sight post.  The laser, when properly adjusted, will be located just above the front sight post.\n\n-Step Two -- Sighting Laser To Point Of Impact\n\nNow that the laser and the iron sights are aligned, further adjustment can be made to ensure the laser aims directly at the point of impact.

Watcha Playin'? is a FreeMMOStation show where we give you a first look with commentary on the most popular free-to-play MMO games available.\n\nVideo made by Skylent Shore: https://www.youtube.com/user/SkylentGames\n\nWatch our amazing weekly free to play games show Free to Play Unlimited.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/show/freetoplayunlimitedwithoxana\n\nVisit www.freemmostation.com to discover the best free to play games and coverage and don't forget to register!\n\nCubic Castles is a friendly mining and crafting build'em up game where players can create some pretty outstanding structures from the obvious castles up to parkour challenges and more!  It's free to play on Windows and Mac and soon will be coming to more platforms like Steam.\n\nWhile Cubic Castles at first seems like a top-down Minecraft, there are a few differences to note. One, there is no battles or combat of any kind, no direct PvP or PvE. This game is a platformer, and the whole point of the game is to jump all over the place! Another difference is the massively multiplayer aspect to the game -- everyone's creations can be accessed from the overworld which you can travel through very similar to games like Final Fantasy. Then you can jump in and take on whatever challenge or see whatever sights they have in store for you!\n\nThe main point of the game is to gain cubits which is a currency that fuels your ability to customize your character and your castle. A great way to make money is to create a challenge map, and then have a donation piggy bank at the front of the gate for users to tip you for your creation. You can also mine them.\n\nSpeaking of mines, besides player-created castles, there are also open world mines which you can jump into to gather materials to be used in your own castle building endeavors. There is also very much a Minecraftian style of crafting in this game and you will likely need to look up crafting recipes and tools needed.\n\nThat is pretty much it in terms of gameplay, it is a simple and friendly creation based platformer.  You can double jump, pick and place objects when allowed, and there are a plethora of different blocks and devices that can help or impede your progress through some maps which is absolutely a plus compared to some more recent games in the genre which only have standing blocks.  \n\nIn terms of graphics, expect this game to run well while still being colorful and nice on the eyes. It's no Crysis but it still has a cartoon artstyle that should be appreciated. Honestly, the game in its entirety is just cute. This game would be extremely popular if it ever made it to mobile devices.\n\nThe only downside I saw to the game was that vision can be blocked (pun intended) by objects that are between the camera and your character from above.

Johnny Shadowfax here, bringing you the latest updates in the world of misogyny and oppression.\n\nIn a debate in Westminster today, a minister revealed a sinister mind-control plot designed to target and socially-engineer young children.\n\nIn a Miss Marple-style reveal, Consumer affairs minister Jenny Willott unveiled the true villains behind the oppressive patriarchy of today - toy companies.\n\nFor years, conventional wisdom has held that the reason that men and women in society tended to perform different roles and have different interests and aspirations was because males and females are actually different. Willot turned that pernicious lie out to pasture today, as she threw the blame squarely where it belonged and blamed - the toy companies.\n\nToy companies were guilty of giving off clear signals, Willot pronounced, \"the shelf may say 'girls' or 'boys' on it, or otherwise girls' and boys' toys may be colour-coded or displayed in separate aisles.\"\n\n\"What message does that send out? What are we telling our children? We are telling them that girls and boys are different, that they like different things and that they have different interests and skills.\"\n\nAudible gasps of disbelief began to fill the hall at this point, as the full extent of the cynical deception of the toy companies began to sink in. \n\n\"We are telling them that their gender defines their roles in society and their dreams about the future.\" said Willot, who was wearing a pink-hued business jacket, a low cut top, a jewelled pendant and earrings, and just a touch of lipstick.\n\nThis is Johnny Shadowfax, reporting for Patriarchy News.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26064302", "title": "Patriarchy News - Mind Control Cult Exposed", "publishedDate": "2014-02-06T21:04:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "36MS7AVXQp4", "description": "\u5927\u5bb6~\u6211\u53c8\u56de\u4f86\u4e86~\u9019\u6b21\u53c8\u88fd\u4f5cHBSCROLL\u7684\u8b5c\u9762~\n\n\u300cTommyrot127 Style\u300d\u9019\u500b\u662f\u641e\u96d9\u95dc\u7684:\n1)\u8b5c\u9762\u7531tommycs127t\u88fd\u4f5c\n2)tommyrot\u6709\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u610f\u601d\n\n\u672c\u4f5c\u54c1\u70ba\u7b2c\u4e8c\u500b\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b8c\u6210\u7684HBSCROLL\u4f5c\u54c1\nHBSCROLL(\u548cBMSCROLL)\u901a\u5e38\u90fd\u70ba\u89c0\u8cde\u7528\u9014\n\n\u5ba3\u50b3\u4e00\u4e0b:\nTommycs127\u592a\u9f13\u983b\u9053\u7684Facebook\u5c08\u9801:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Tommycs127%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%AA%E9%BC%93%E9%A0%BB%E9%81%93/495867057144219\n\u5927\u5bb6\u53ef\u4ee5\u900f\u904e\u5c08\u9801\u7684\u5857\u9d09\u7246\u548c\u8a0a\u606f\u4f86\u5efa\u8b70\u6b4c\u66f2\u554a\u549a!\n\n946combo\n10\u661f\nBPM:128(\u4e0d\u8a08\u8b8a\u901fBPM)\n\u521d\u9805:310\n\u516c\u5dee:80", "title": "[\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd-HBSCROLL]Sporty - O - Let Me Hit It", "publishedDate": "2014-03-10T14:37:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "36MwnqW2sGg", "description": "Debut album 'Hello Memory' available now!\n\niTunes/Google Play: http://smarturl.it/HelloMemory\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/Ldspotify\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/LDHMamazon\nOfficial Store: http://myplay.me/1a2l\n\nOfficial video for Little Daylight \"Overdose\" directed by Special Problems\n\nFollow Little Daylight:\nhttp://littledaylightsounds.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/LittleDaylight\nhttps://www.facebook.com/littledaylig...\nhttp://instagram.com/littledaylight\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/LittleDay...\n\nMusic video by Little Daylight performing Overdose.

Benedict Arnold Obama is Starting A New Civil War by Protesting State Power ! Arizona , Wisconsin , Ohio , Etc. Etc. and is Now Ignoring The Constitution and Following The Orders Of The United Nations ! The Patriots Are Working Hard to Unite Everyone , and Obama and Many Others in Washington DC Are Moving At Light Speed To Undo everything Patriotic Americans Do and have done through out OUR GREAT HISTORY !!! . The American Patriots Must Rise Up and Call their People in Washington to FIRE people One Day At A Time . Today We Fire Janet Napolitano and Hillary Clinton !! All People Have to Do starting today make One Phone Call ! Fire One Traitor Of Freedom A week . The Time To Make A Stand For Freedom Was Yesterday , Not Today , and We Must Fight by using Free Speech as Our Most Powerful Weapon To Win Now !! WE THE PEOPLE ARE HOME LAND SECURITY !! UNITED WE Can Exterminate The Termites Of Tyranny !! :) Keep The Faith My Friends :) The Time For The American Patriots To Organize A 3 Million Patriot March On Washington DC IS NOW !!! We Can Call it A TEXAS TEA PARTY AT THE WHITE HOUSE Because We Must Protest The High Price at The Gas Pumps and OBAMA MUST GO !!

Millions of users of the Kindle reader and app can now borrow Kindle books from their local public library. The company is working with OverDrive, a leading supplier of e-books and other digital content to libraries. The service will be available through the websites of more than eleven thousand local libraries across the country. Users of other devices including the Barnes and Noble Nook and Sony Reader have already been able to borrow library books. Experts say Amazon's entry is likely to reopen a debate between publishers and libraries over e-book lending. Bill Rosenblatt is president of Giant Steps Media Technology Strategies, a consulting company. He says \"Publishers and libraries are enemies that occur in nature like snakes and mongeese. Libraries would like to be able to make books available to everyone, all the time, with no limitations. And publishers, of course, would like to sell more books to the public.\"  Mr. Rosenblatt says the debate in the United States centers on what is known as the law of first sale. \"Once you buy any kind of media product such as a book or a CD or a DVD or anything like that, you can do whatever you want with it. You can read it, you can give it away, you can lend it, you can resell it, you can burn it, you can use it as a Frisbee -- whatever you want.\" This law of first sale is what permits libraries to lend books over and over again without having to pay publishers each time. But it does not include digital products. Technology known as digital rights management can make e-books unreadable once they have reached a certain time or user limit. Bill Rosenblatt points out that one of the major publishers made an announcement several months ago. Harper Collins said it was only going to allow e-books to be lent out twenty-six times, and then they would have to be purchased by the libraries again. HarperCollins says it took the action to protect the growing e-book industry and its own book sales. But Bill Rosenblatt says critics did not see it that way. They think \"because a digital book lasts forever, as long as it's stored somewhere in digital form, that it should be lendable forever.\" He says the debate over e-book lending will likely end up in court.

It is his one of the another contribution that he always preached the true essence of Islam, free from any type of negative constraints or influence E.g. schism, exhibition of knowledge, pride or for worldly gain etc. His knowledge was so vast and his memory was remarkable that he used to appreciate the contribution of Ulama (scholars) without any discrimination whether they are Brailvi, Deobandi or Ahle Hadees or whoever else. Maulana Ishaq is equally popular among the youth and the old ones. He is liked among Religious or Liberal class through his teachings/lectures to seek guidance from it. \n\n\nMaulana Mufti Ishaq rahmatullah ailah never associated him to any group (Maslak) instead he always called himself a Muslim and his all lectures are purely related to the original primitive teaching of Islam. He always addressed the issues of the questioners and provided them with best solution. This could only be possible if the Religion (ISLAM) is taken into his complete sense.\n\nHis efforts are appreciable and unforgettable. May Allah bless him with Jannat ul firdous .

Recently the blood-thinning drug Pradaxa has been linked to life threatning and sometimes fatal internal bleeding and heart attacks. Anew study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine has found that Pradaxa was \"significantly associated with a higher risk\" of heart attacks and acute coronary syndrome compared to similar blood thinning drugs. Over 500 cases of hemorhaging have been reported to the FDA in the first quarter of 2011 alone. Since Pradaxa was prescribed primarily to the elderly, the number of deaths and serious side effects are much more common among those 65 years or older. Worse yet, there have been over 260 deaths worldwide which have been directly linked to Pradaxa. This drug was first approved and marketed in October of 2010 as a new line of blood thinner prescribed to patients who are at risk for irregular heartbeat, which can lead to stroke or death. This medication carries a risk of internal bleeding common to other blood thining drugs; however the likelihood of it becoming life threatning appears to be greater among Pradaxa users. The adverse health effects associated with Pradaxa-induced internal bleeding include the following: \nUnusal bleeding or bruising\nCoughing up or vomiting blood\nPink or brown colored urine\nRed or black tar like stools\nIf you believe you or someone close to you is experiencing a Pradaxa related side effect, please seek out medical attention from a professional immediately for an evaluation. Then call 1-877-681-5618 anytime to receive a no charge consultation about your potential claim in a Pradaxa lawsuit. the lawyers you will contact through this number are committed to exposing the dangers of this medication and pursuing justice on behalf of all those that have been needlessly harmed by it.

It is the world's largest passenger airliner; many airports have upgraded their facilities to accommodate it because of its size. Initially named Airbus A3XX, Airbus designed the aircraft to challenge Boeing's monopoly in the large-aircraft market; the A380 made its first flight on 27 April 2005 and entered commercial service in October 2007 with Singapore Airlines.\n\nThe A380's upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage, with a width equivalent to a wide-body aircraft. This gives the A380-800's cabin 478 square metres (5,145.1 sq ft) of floor space, which is 40% more than the next-largest airliner, the Boeing 747-8,[4] and provides seating for 525 people in a typical three-class configuration or up to 853 people in an all-economy class configuration. The A380-800 has a design range of 15,700 kilometres (8,500 nmi; 9,800 mi), sufficient to fly nonstop from Dubai to Los Angeles, and a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (about 900 km/h or 560 mph; 490 kn at cruising altitude).\n\nAs of December 2013 Airbus has received 304 firm orders and delivered 122 aircraft. Emirates has the most A380s on firm order with 140 as of December 2013.[2]\n\n\nL'Airbus A380 est un avion de ligne civil tr\u00e8s gros-porteur long-courrier quadrir\u00e9acteur \u00e0 double pont produit par Airbus civil aircrafts, filiale d'Airbus Group. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont produits et assembl\u00e9s dans diff\u00e9rents pays de l'Union europ\u00e9enne ; les principaux le sont en France, en Allemagne, en Espagne et au Royaume-Uni. D'autres pi\u00e8ces proviennent d'autres pays dont la Belgique et l'assemblage final est r\u00e9alis\u00e9 sur le site de Toulouse, en France.\n\nLe programme A380, d'un co\u00fbt total de d\u00e9veloppement de 8 milliards d'euros1, a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 au milieu des ann\u00e9es 1990 sous le nom d'Airbus A3XX. Le premier vol a eu lieu le 27 avril 2005 \u00e0 l'a\u00e9roport de Toulouse-Blagnac et le premier service commercial s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 le 25 octobre 2007 par Singapore Airlines entre Singapour et Sydney6. En mars 2013, le 100e A380 est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie Malaysia Airlines7.\n\nL'A380 est, en 2013, le plus gros avion civil de transport de passagers en service et le troisi\u00e8me plus gros avion de l'histoire de l'a\u00e9ronautique, apr\u00e8s le Hughes H-4 Hercules et l'Antonov An-225. Le pont sup\u00e9rieur de l'A380 s'\u00e9tend sur toute la longueur du fuselage, ce qui donne \u00e0 la cabine 50 % de surface de plus que celle de son concurrent direct, le Boeing 747-4008.\n\nInitialement, l'A380 \u00e9tait propos\u00e9 en deux versions. L'A380-800, la version passager, peut transporter de 525 passagers \u00e0 853 passagers suivant la configuration (trois classes standards ou classe \u00e9conomique unique). La version A380-800F cargo, peut emporter jusqu'\u00e0 150 tonnes de fret. En raison des probl\u00e8mes d'industrialisation de l'A380-800 et des d\u00e9sistements des principaux clients, Airbus s'est r\u00e9solu \u00e0 reporter le d\u00e9veloppement de la version cargo apr\u00e8s 2015, tout en continuant la prospection commerciale9. Il existe aussi une version Prestige surnomm\u00e9e Flying Palace et destin\u00e9e au march\u00e9 des jets d'affaire.\n\nL'A380-800 a un rayon d'action de 15 400 kilom\u00e8tres, ce qui lui permet de voler de New York jusqu'\u00e0 Hong Kong sans escale, \u00e0 la vitesse de 900 km/h (Mach 0,88) jusqu'\u00e0 1 012 km/h (Mach 0,92)10. Son principal client est Emirates, la compagnie de Duba\u00ef ayant command\u00e9 50 appareils suppl\u00e9mentaires le 17 novembre 2013 pour porter \u00e0 140 sa flotte d'A380.\n\n\nDer Airbus A380 (umgangssprachlich auch Superjumbo als Steigerung von Jumbo-Jet, Airbus-interner Projektname Megaliner) ist ein vierstrahliges Gro\u00dfraumflugzeug des europ\u00e4ischen Flugzeugherstellers Airbus S. A. S. mit zwei durchg\u00e4ngigen Passagierdecks. Der Tiefdecker ist das gr\u00f6\u00dfte zivile Verkehrsflugzeug, das bisher in Serienfertigung produziert wurde. W\u00e4hrend der Konzeptionsphase wurde das Flugzeug als Airbus A3XX bezeichnet. Die Endmontage des Flugzeugs findet in Toulouse und die Kabinenausr\u00fcstung in Hamburg-Finkenwerder statt. Der Erstflug dieses Langstreckenflugzeugs wurde am 27. April 2005 mit einer Maschine mit der Werksseriennummer MSN001 in der Version A380-841 absolviert. Bisher wurden 304 Flugzeuge dieses Typs bestellt.[2] Die erste Maschine wurde am 15. Oktober 2007 in Toulouse an die Fluggesellschaft Singapore Airlines \u00fcbergeben[3] und hatte am 25.

Insulin is released by the pancreas and can be either your best friend or worst foe. It is great when it promotes muscle building and it sucks when it promotes fat storage. The role of insulin in the body is to lower blood sugar levels when they get too high. When you eat any sort of food it is broken down into its simplest form glucose (sugar) and released into your bloodstream. This release of sugar causes your blood sugar to rise above normal levels.

At first, we found an article of Ural archeologist concerning to the large accumulation of the mammoth bones on the Sochva river and some other rivers in Ural Mountains. After hard work in the National Scientific library we obtained a lot of information about Russian mammoth localities in Siberia (especially in Yamalo-Nenetsky region).\n\nThen we organized several scientific expeditions for finding the localities. The first expedition of 3 persons traveled to the localities at the banks of the rivers Irtish, Tobol, Tura by train, buses and mainly  by feet, through almost impassable Siberian forests and bogs. We did not find anything in the main parts of the places described in the Soviet paleontologist literature. But we have discovered a lot of unknown localities of the bones of Pleistocene fauna. We found tons of bones, parts of sculls, tusks, teeth of mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horses, bisons, deers etc.\n\nGenerally, the bones are located at the high precipice banks on the bend of the river. Wide terraces, composed by sands, clays, clay sands, loams, are recovered under precipice banks during low water level in autumn. A lot of bones have been found on these terraces. The water erodes the bone-bearing clay-send levels at the river banks during spring high-water, and then the bone sediments settle at the terraces. \n\nUsually among the bones we find the parts of different mammoths, woolly rhinoceros, horses, deers, bisons skeletons. Findings of cave bear, lion or wolf bones are considerably rare. The bones are from the different animals, different sizes, and in some case characterized by the different age. We did not find any original complete skeleton  the number of original bones from one animal does not exceed 10% in the accumulation of bones. Nevertheless we select collection of the bones corresponded by size from the tons of excavated material, that allows us to make the skeleton. This composite skeleton is not interested for the paleontologists in mammoth specialization, but it could be useful for general paleontologists and very interesting as historical and aesthetic object.\nhttp://www.russian-mammoth.com", "title": "Russian Mammoth", "publishedDate": "2010-05-06T17:07:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "37AyS1q31Ag", "description": "Lonnie & Darian play Garden of Fear (iPad Gameplay Video)\n\nThis is part 1 of my video game commentary playthrough / walkthrough series of \"Let's play Garden of Fear\" for iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and any other iOS devices.\n\nIn this episode: maybe I just suck at games, but I can't help but notice...
