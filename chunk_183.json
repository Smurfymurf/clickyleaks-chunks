This is the same for scooters and rollerblade/inline skates.\n\nBefore cleaning longboard or street skating bearings remove the seals or shields for best results.\nHere are a couple of easy ways to remove and replace skateboard bearing seals and shields.\n\nEach bearing accommodates 2 covers/closures that are either removable rubber seals, removable metal shields (held in by a C-ring), and non-removable pressed in metal shields.   \n\nTools For Removing Rubber Bearing Seals:\n-- Paper clip\n\nTools For Removing Metal Bearing shields\n-- Push pin, needle, or razor blade\n\nHow to remove and replace a skateboard bearing seal:\n1.  Poke the end of a paper clip about 1-2mm inside the bearing between the inner ring and edge of the seal.\n\n2.  Push the paper clip down to pry the seal off.\n\n3. To put the bearing seal back on lay the seal on the bearing and press it gently into place.\n\nHow to remove a metal shield:\n1. A c-ring is a narrow skinny washer with an opening.  It is in the shape of a 'C'. The opening was cut at an angle. Each end is cut at opposing angles. Place the tip of your push pin, needle, or razor blade corner against the open end pointing out and try to pry it out.\n\n2. When the c-ring is out, tap the bearing on a hard surface to get the shield out.\n\n3. To put the bearing shield on lay the shield back on and slide the c-ring back into place.  It can be a bit tricky.  Try getting both ends first or one end at a time.\n\n\nFor more information go to http://ratvision.com/index.php/info/bearings\n\nTo learn more about bearings watch these videos below:\n\nHow To Clean Skateboard & Longboard Bearings\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEkAeVVivK8&list=UUbu8ciTntV-TfYUgisYMe7A&index=8\n\nAll About ABEC, Swiss, and Ceramic Longboard & Skateboard Bearings\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRK0w8P-qy4&list=UUbu8ciTntV-TfYUgisYMe7A&index=6\n\nWheels, Bearings, and Bearing Spacers\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPVBRc4-nTQ&list=UUbu8ciTntV-TfYUgisYMe7A&index=5", "title": "Take Off Skateboard & Longboard Bearing Shields/Seals", "publishedDate": "2011-08-10T21:53:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "AXm_-62asho", "description": "Description", "title": "Rainbow Whiptail", "publishedDate": "2014-08-12T07:59:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "AXmm-l9T9CU", "description": "Le 3 Mai 2014, Effervescence revient sur sc\u00e8ne avec son nouveau spectacle : \"Effervescence fait sa rentr\u00e9e\".

Halfway between a coup\u00e9 and a cabriolet, the car featured a roof which folded away in two sections. This allowed the retention of a central beam which ran lengthways giving the car rigidity and protection if it rolled, as well as the benefits of open-top driving.\n\nMore information: http://www.artcurial.com/en/asp/fullCatalogue.asp?salelot=2138+++++217+&refno=10394694", "title": "1971 Citro\u00ebn SM Espace", "publishedDate": "2012-06-19T15:56:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "AXo28e30SKc", "description": "Music video by Foreigner performing Hot Blooded (Official Lyric Video).

I chose to use some leftovers for convenience purposes but fresh ingredients make a great dish!  In this recipe I used some pre-cooked chicken breast, pre-cooked brown rice, 2 whole eggs, copped garlic, onion, scallion and frozen vegetables (in this case peas and carrots) - Feel free to customize the dish to however you like it and enjoy!\n\nThe macros on the way I prepared the male seen in the video are as follows\n\nTotal Calories = 538\n\nCarbs = 52 \nFat = 12 \nProtein = 46 \n\nIt is extremely easy to adjust the macros to fit your needs.  You can make this a lower carb meal by removing the rice and keeping it as vegetables or you can add more if you choose.  If you would like higher fat add olive oil, or lower fat remove the whole eggs and use just the whites!

Israel says 48 of its soldiers and three civilians - two Israelis and a Thai worker, have been killed.\nEarly on Tuesday, Israeli aircraft fired at the house of the former Hamas Prime Minister, Ismail Haniyeh, his son and Gaza officials said.\nThe house was thought to be empty at the time, Reuters news agency said.\nHamas said that its TV station, Al-Aqsa TV, was also targeted, reports said.\nMeanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that three rockets were fired from Gaza, with one rocket successfully intercepted and two hitting open spaces in central Israel.On Monday, explosions in Gaza City reportedly killed 10 people, including children.\nIsrael said that five of its soldiers died on Monday, and five Hamas militants were also killed inside Israel.\nMr Netanyahu described Monday as a \"painful day\", adding: \"We have to have patience.\"\n\"We will continue to act aggressively and responsibly until the mission is completed to protect our citizens, soldiers and children,\" he said.\nOn Monday, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon criticised both sides for firing into civilians areas, and called for an immediate, unconditional humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza during the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday.\n\"In the name of humanity, the violence must stop,\" he told reporters, adding that Gaza was in a \"critical condition\".His spokesman later added that Mr Ban was concerned at reports that leaflets had been dropped by the IDF warning residents in the northern Gaza Strip to evacuate to Gaza City.\n\"If true, this would have a further devastating humanitarian impact on the beleaguered civilians of those areas of the Gaza strip, who have already undergone immense suffering in recent days,\" his spokesman said.\nAt least 10 people - eight of them children - were killed in blasts in Gaza City on Monday afternoon, Palestinian health officials said.\nThey said the 10 were killed by Israeli missile strikes, but Israel says the explosions were caused by rockets misfired by \"terrorists\".\nFour Israeli soldiers were killed and another 10 injured when a mortar shell hit the Eshkol district in southern Israel on Monday.\nThe Israeli military said the five Hamas militants who died had entered Israel via a tunnel from Gaza and opened fire on Israeli troops, who returned fire.\nTAGS\nabc breaking news, bbc, bbc football, bbc iplayer, bbc news, bbc news america, bbc persian, bbc sport, bbc weather, bbc world news, breaking celebrity news, breaking election news, breaking late news, breaking local news, breaking music news, breaking news, breaking news alerts, breaking news canada, breaking news headlines, breaking news in atlanta, breaking news in nigeria, breaking news india, breaking news pensacola florida, breaking news plane crash, breaking news story, breaking sports news, business expensive news home media world, christian world news, cnn, cnn breaking news, cnn money, cnn news, cnn news breaking news, cnn news world, detroit breaking news, global news, headline, headline news, health care technology news, hot latest global news, internet technology news, las vegas breaking news, latest breaking news, latest celebrity news, latest information technology news, latest music news, latest news, latest news headlines, latest news update, latest sports news, live breaking news, local breaking news, local news today, msn breaking news, nbc breaking news, nbc world news, news of the world, news report us world, news today news, news updated daily, solar technology news, sports news today, technology news, the latest news, today news, us news and world, us news and world report, us news and world report magazine, us news and world report web site, us news world report, world news, world news daily, world news headlines", "title": "Israel PM Netanyahu warns of 'prolonged' Gaza campaign | BREAKING NEWS :29/07/14", "publishedDate": "2014-07-29T04:51:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "AYHYgB1ljm0", "description": "The Delta Blues is the best Blues amp on the market today.

All the missiles fired, successfully acquired the targets, says a Pakistan Navy press release. It said that a combination of SAM series were tested which gave PN the flexibility to operate with a range of missiles and strengthen the ground based air defence. The area of responsibility of Air Defence Battalion stretches from Sir Creek in the east to Jiwani in the west. A large number of Armed Forces officers witnessed the firing serial. Chief of Naval Staff appreciated the efforts put in by the Air Defence Battalion of Coastal Command and urged the officers and men to leave no stone unturned to ensure an impeccable defence. Upon his arrival, the Admiral was given a detailed briefing by Commander Marines. The Commander in his brief said that air threat being very dynamic in nature has assumed multiple dimensions in today's warfare and continuously changing with the rapid technological developments. He added that the induction of these state of the art weapons/equipment will augment PN ground based air defence capabilities against Hi-Tech aircraft and incoming missiles.

Not only does Accord advance the state of the art in its segment, but the new Honda Accord models also introduce a host of new technologies to Honda - while serving as the first vehicle to use Honda's new Earth Dreams\u2122 technology, which is dedicated to enhancing fuel efficiency and minimizing the company's environmental footprint. In early 2013, an all-new 2014 Accord Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) Sedan will launch, followed by a conventional hybrid based on the same powertrain architecture in the summer of 2013, bringing Honda levels of fun and efficiency to the hybrid segment.\nIn addition to the upcoming hybrid versions of the Accord, the all-new 2013 Accord Sedan 4-door is available in LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, EX-L V6 and new Touring trim levels, while the 2-door Accord Coupe comes in LX-S, EX, EX-L and EX-L V6 trim levels. Standard features on the new Accord include Bluetooth\u00ae HandsFreeLink\u00ae with audio streaming, USB/iPod\u00ae integration, rearview camera and an audio/information screen and an Eco Assist\u2122 driving system. As in previous EX-trim Accords, a choice of fabric or leather seating upholstery is available.\nOther standard Accord features include dual-zone climate control, Pandora\u00ae internet radio integration and an SMS text messaging function. Available features include a hard disc drive (HDD)-based Honda Satellite-Linked Navigation System\u2122 with Voice Recognition and FM Traffic, and Adaptive Cruise Control. New visibility technologies include an expanded-view driver's mirror and Honda's new LaneWatch\u2122 feature - along with available features such as LED headlights, daytime running lights (DRLs) and brake lights.\nSafety advancements include a thoroughly revised Advanced Compatibility Engineering\u2122 (ACE\u2122) body structure and available Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) systems.\nTwo Earth Dreams\u2122 powertrains are available initially, including an all-new 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with Honda's first use of direct injection in North America, and a 3.5-liter V-6 with revised VTEC + VCM functions. In early 2013, the Accord lineup will see the first application of a new Earth Dreams\u2122 2.0-liter 4-cylinder/two-motor plug-in hybrid system in the Honda Accord PHEV Sedan. The Honda two-motor hybrid system will operate continuously through three modes - all-electric, gasoline-electric and direct-drive - to maximize fuel efficiency. The 2014 Accord Plug-in Hybrid will also serve as the basis for a conventional hybrid version of the Accord Sedan, which will join the Accord lineup in the summer of 2013. Accord 4-cylinder models will offer a continuously variable transmission (CVT) that helps the Accord achieve outstanding fuel-efficiency, along with a new fun-to-shift 6-speed manual transmission on selected models. The Accord's V-6 engine offers a choice of a new 6-speed automatic or in the V-6 Coupe, a 6-speed manual.

That hasn't stopped the company from actively trying to better the line, though; it'll still sell the e-readers in stores even after the split is complete, and it's delegated manufacture of new Nook devices to Samsung.\n\nThe latter company joined with Barnes & Noble this morning in New York City to announce the new Nook. Technically co-branded as the \"Galaxy Tab 4 Nook,\" the new device is just what it sounds like: a rebadged Tab 4 7.0 with a special suite of Nook features and services baked in, and offered at Barnes & Noble stores at a discounted price of $179 (after a $20 mail-in rebate). The new Nook also comes bundled with a pretty solid set of free toss-ins: up to three bestselling books, three downloadable television episodes, $5 in Nook cash credit, and four \"top magazine\" subscriptions \u2013 all of which provide the previous 12 issues at no additional charge.\n\nFor a buyer as reading-focused as we assume the typical Nook consumer is, that's no small amount of incentive. And backed up by the promise of in-store customer support and tutorials from cross-trained Barnes & Nobile booksellers, the new Nook might just be the kind of thing that charges your battery. (More savvy tablet shoppers might be prompted to find better specs or features elsewhere.)\n\nSo what's it like to hold? And what else is included in Barnes & Noble's software customizations?

In the first part a moth of the Zygaena species (probably a five-spot burnet moth, or Zygaena trifolii) is visible on a bishops wort plant (Betonica officinalis L.), and in the second part on a protected silver thistle (Carlina acaulis L.). These plants are indigenous to the area. The meaty centre of the silver thistle is one of the horses' favourite treats. The flora of the former meadows of the B\u00fckk plateau is being damaged partly by the hooves and manure of the horses, but even more by weeds growing from seeds mixed in with their feed.\nHowever, in the places where livestock is not kept the meadows are becoming heavily forested, thereby robbing the B\u00fckk National Park of one of its main attractions.

The term is used for both feral and pet varieties. The domestic dog has been one of the most widely kept working and companion animals in human history.\n\nThe word \"dog\" may also mean the male of a canine species,[2] as opposed to the word \"bitch\" for the female of the species.[3]\n\nThe dog quickly became ubiquitous across world cultures, and was extremely valuable to early human settlements. For instance, it is believed that the successful emigration across the Bering Strait might not have been possible without sled dogs.[4] Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This versatility, more than almost any other known animal, has given them the nickname \"Man's best friend\" in the western world. Currently, there are estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.[5]\n\nOver the 15,000 year span that the dog had been domesticated, it diverged into only a handful of landraces, groups of similar animals whose morphology and behavior have been shaped by environmental factors and functional roles. As the modern understanding of genetics developed, humans began to intentionally breed dogs for a wide range of specific traits. Through this process, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.[6] For example, height measured to the withers ranges from a few inches in the Chihuahua to a few feet in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called \"blue'\") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark (\"red\" or \"chocolate\") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.[7] It is common for most breeds to shed this coat.\n\nDog is the common use term that refers to members of the subspecies Canis lupus familiaris. The term is sometimes used to refer to a wider range of species: it can be used to refer to some belonging to the family Canidae, which includes foxes, jackals, Bush Dog, the African Wild Dog and coyotes and many others; or it can be used to refer to the subfamily of Caninae, or the genus Canis, also often called the \"true dogs,\" which genus includes only the wolf, jackal, coyote, and dog.[8] Some members of the family have \"dog\" in their common names, such as the Raccoon Dog and the African Wild Dog. A few animals have \"dog\" in their common names but are not canids, such as the prairie dog.\n\nThe English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a \"powerful dog breed\".[9] The term may derive from Proto-Germanic *dukk\u014dn, represented in Old English finger-docce (\"finger-muscle\").[10] The word also shows the familiar petname diminutive -ga also seen in frogga \"frog\", picga \"pig\", stagga \"stag\", wicga \"beetle, worm\", among others.[11] \n\nIn 14th century England, hound (from German: 'hund') was the general word for all domestic canines, and dog referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff. It is believed that this \"dog\" type of \"hound\" was so common that it eventually became the prototype of the category \"hound\".[13] By the 16th century, dog had become the general word, and hound had begun to refer only to types used for hunting.[14] Hound, cognate to German Hund, Dutch hond.\n\nIn breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a dog, while a female is called a bitch (Middle English bicche, from Old English bicce, ultimately from Old Norse bikkja). A group of offspring is a litter. The father of a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the dam. Offspring are generally called pups or puppies, from French poup\u00e9e, until they are about a year old. The process of birth is whelping, from the Old English word hwelp, (cf. German Welpe, Dutch welp, Swedish valp, Icelandic hvelpur) .[16]\nCategory:", "title": "Fedel casterated.", "publishedDate": "2012-01-31T02:59:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "AYoYq94f1i4", "description": "", "title": "How-To Make An Inkle Loom", "publishedDate": "2014-10-15T12:17:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "AYohvIpP5QY", "description": "Cancer isn't just a zodiac sign.\n\nMusic:\nOculus\nby: Hebona\nsoundcloud.com/hebona\n\nSources:\nhttp://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/radon\nhttp://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/formaldehyde\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/docs/citizens_methylene_glycol_en.pdf\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/health-21682779\nhttp://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-03/bc-pm030513.php\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/13/processed-meat-pancreatic-cancer-bacon-sausage_n_1204620.html\nhttp://discovermagazine.com/2005/jan/farmed-salmon-may-cause-cancer\nhttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/08/040811144803.htm\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21898562 \nhttps://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=43081 \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2698592/\nhttp://www.livestrong.com/article/272066-why-is-hydrogenated-oil-bad-for-you/ \nhttp://www.webmd.com/diet/features/trans-fats-science-and-risks\nhttp://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/athome/acrylamide\nhttp://www.cancer.org/cancer/news/expertvoices/post/2013/06/26/does-drinking-alcohol-increase-the-risk-of-cancer.aspx \nhttp://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2011/12/07/the-causes-of-cancer-you-can-control/\nhttp://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/radiationexposureandcancer/uvradiation/index\nhttp://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/pollution/diesel-exhaust\nhttp://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/radiation-chemicals-and-breast-cancer/parabens.html\n\nLINKS!\nhttp://www.buzzfeed.com\nhttp://www.buzzfeed.com/video\nhttp://www.youtube.com/buzzfeed\nhttp://www.youtube.com/buzzfeedvideo\nhttp://www.youtube.com/buzzfeedyellow\nhttp://www.youtube.com/buzzfeedblue\nhttp://www.youtube.com/buzzfeedpop\nhttp://www.youtube.com/cnnbuzzfeed\n\nBUZZFEED VIDEO\nBuzzFeed is the world's first true social news organization.

Protester Interrupts Muslim Service at National Cathedral\n\n\nChristian woman stands up, speaks out:\n\n\nThe cathedral has hosted Muslims at interfaith services in the past. But this is the first time the cathedral has invited Muslims to come and lead their own prayers there.\n\nBut just as the Imam was about to give the Muslim call to prayer, a Christian woman, who apparently sneaked into the service, stood up, pointed to the cross and shouted \u201cJesus Christ died on that cross. He is the reason we are to worship only Him. Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior. We have built enough of your mosques in this country. Why don\u2019t you worship in your mosques and leave our churches alone? \u2026America was founded on Christian principles\u2026Leave our church alone!\u201d\n\nShe was immediately grabbed by the arms and forcibly led out of the church by two men.

Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, said in a Facebook post Thursday that the Muslim prayer service at the National Cathedral is \u201csad to see\u201d because the church should only open its doors for worship of \u201cthe One True God of the Bible.\u201d\n\nGraham, who heads the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan\u2019s Purse, said, \u201cTomorrow, the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. \u2013 one of the most prominent Episcopal churches in America \u2013 will host a Muslim prayer service to Allah.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to see a church open its doors to the worship of anything other than the One True God of the Bible who sent His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, to earth to save us from our sins,\u201d said Graham. \u201cJesus was clear when He said, \u2018I am the way the truth and the life.

It can be noticed and found with proper checking methods. Watch our video to learn what a lump feels like and how to check for one.\n\nWhat Does a Breast Cancer Lump Feel Like\nA breast cancer lump is usually hard when you feel it. The edges may be somewhat indistinct. It may only feel like a thickening in the breast. It may not even feel like a mass, per say. But any mass in the breast may or may not be breast cancer and has to be looked at with suspicion until we figure out what it is. When you go for your mammograms, you can have a mass that's quite small found that you can't feel and the doctors can't feel. So this shows you, if you're going for routine mammograms, how big the mass might be. If you go for your first mammogram and something is found it's about this big, still too small to feel. If you're doing breast self-exams or you're having a physician exam, this is the smallest size that can be felt. So remember, a mammogram will find something smaller than you or your physician can feel. If you haven't gone for mammograms but you are doing breast self-exams, you may find a mass that's about this big.  If you never go, then the mass will be this big and you'll never do real self-exams, so it's big important to get the mammograms as recommended so that you can find something before you can even feel it or your doctor can feel it. When you do find a lump, look for any bloody nipple discharge. That's a really important sign that it could be cancer. You also look for any swelling in the neck or in the armpit that could be swollen glands from cancer spread from the breast to the armpit or up into the neck area. Very important to pay attention when you have a lump to have it taken care of by a healthcare professional. So see your family practitioner, see your gynecologist, see your somebody who you trust to figure out whether this is cancer or not.

Protest? Participate in a rally? Walk all the way across the country?\n\nWe are.\n\nThis summer, a group of activists will be walking across America to achieve more freedom and liberty.\n\nOur pioneer forefathers trekked across the continent from the east to the west to find a better life for themselves. This time, we're doing it in reverse.\n \nI am walking coast-to-coast across the country, from Oregon to New Hampshire. I am joined by my immediate family as well. We're on a quest to gain more freedom for ourselves and for our country by spreading the message of freedom and liberty along the way.\n\nWhy are we doing this?\n\nWe see the gradual chipping away at freedoms in America, and want to do our part to stop it. My wife and I are moving to New Hampshire as part of the Free State Project. New Hampshire is already the freest state in the country, which is why we are moving there. But we also want to help bring more freedom to as many other people as possible.\n\nTherefore we are walking across America to get to New Hampshire. We are walking all the way there to bring as much media attention and publicity as possible to two liberty-oriented causes: the Free State Project, which is working to make New Hampshire even more free, and Ron Paul's message of freedom for everyone. To learn more about the Free State Project, visit http://freestateproject.org To learn more about Ron Paul, visit http://ronpaul2008.com\n\nFollow Our Progress\n\nRead my blog at http://willbuchanan.com/blog to learn more about the latest in our preparations for the Walk For Liberty and our progress and adventures during it. You may also subscribe to it at http://willbuchanan.com/blog/feed\n\nHow you can help\n\nPlease visit http://walkforliberty.com/help-out if you'd like to help the Walk For Liberty achieve more freedom for everyone.\n\nDonate\n\nWould you consider donating $3 to help support the Walk For Liberty? Even the price of a cup of coffee will go a long way to helping pay for our mission to promote liberty. No donation is too small!

The ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the Anatidae family; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species) but a form taxon, since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.  Hilarious ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules, and coots.  The overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad, and the bird ducks are also relatively long-necked, albeit not as long-necked as the geese and swans. The body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in being more rounded. The adorable bill is usually broad and contains serrated lamellae, which are particularly well defined in the filter-feeding species. In the case of some fishing species the sweet bill is long and strongly serrated. The scaled legs are strong and well developed, and generally set far back on the body, more so in the highly aquatic species. The wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed, and the flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes, requiring in turn strong wing muscles. Three species of steamer duck are almost flightless, however. Many species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting; they seek out protected habitat with good food supplies during this period. This moult typically precedes migration. The drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage, but that is moulted in summer to give a more female-like appearance, the \"eclipse\" plumage. Southern resident species typically show less sexual dimorphism, although there are exceptions like the Paradise Shelduck of New Zealand which is both strikingly sexually dimorphic and where the female's plumage is brighter than that of the male. The plumage of juvenile birds generally resembles that of the female duckling.  Sexy ducks exploit a variety of food sources such as grasses, aquatic plants, fish, insects, small amphibians, worms, and small molluscs. Diving ducklings and sea ducks forage deep underwater. To be able to submerge more easily, the diving ducks are heavier than dabbling ducks, and therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly. Dabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land, or as deep as they can reach by up-ending without completely submerging. Along the edge of the beak there is a comb-like structure called a pecten. This strains the water squirting from the side of the beak and traps any food. The pecten is also used to preen feathers and to hold slippery food items. A few specialized species such as the mergansers are adapted to catch and swallow large funny fish. The others have the characteristic wide flat beak adapted to dredging-type jobs such as pulling up waterweed, pulling worms and small molluscs out of mud, searching for insect larvae, and bulk jobs such as dredging out, holding, turning headfirst, and swallowing a squirming frog kitten kitty kitties kittens cute cuter cat cats feline felines adorable lovely love pet pets animal animals sweet nice catnip purr purrs purring milk pregnant pregnancy pregnancies puss pussy kittycat kittycats kit pussycat tail tails feed feeding milking mice hunt hunting play playing toy toys whisker whiskers cutest hair hairy fur furry catch playing pussycats litter litters outdoors outdoors urine meal meals scat litter box litter boxes things good bad weird strange odd fast calico calicos  To avoid injury when digging into sediment it has no cere, but the nostrils come out through hard horn.  The ducks are generally monogamous, although these bonds generally last a single year only. Larger species and the more sedentary species (like fast river specialists) tend to have pair-bonds that last numerous years. Most cute duck species breed once a year, choosing to do so in favourable conditions (spring/summer or wet seasons). Ducks also tend to make a nest before breeding. Although mother ducks are very caring and protective of their young, they are not above abandoning some of their ducklings if they are physically stuck in an area they cannot get out of or are not prospering due to genetic defects or sickness brought about by hypothermia, starvation, or disease. Ducklings can also be orphaned by inconsistent, late hatching where a few eggs hatch long after the mother has abandoned the nest. A common urban legend claims that duck quacks do not echo; however, this has been shown to be false. This myth was first debunked by the Acoustics Research Centre at the University of Salford in 2003 as part of the British Association's Festival of Science. It was also debunked in one of the earlier episodes of the popular Discovery Channel television show MythBusters", "title": "Mama duck fights off hungry crow to protect ducklings", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T21:22:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "AZ_kOOH_lQk", "description": "Hip Hop dance on M.I.A. title Double Bubble Trouble.

Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals,while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi. Fertilization is the fusion of both sex cell or gamete.Copulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for insemination and subsequent internal fertilization. Mating may also lead to external fertilization, as seen in amphibians, fishes and plants. For the majority of species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. However, for some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not required because the parent organism is capable of self-fertilization (autogamy); for example, banana slugs.\nFor animals, mating strategies include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of mating and artificially inseminating domesticated animals is part of animal husbandry.", "title": "Animals animal Mating    Kangaroos", "publishedDate": "2014-09-01T06:59:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "AZh-4ReI06o", "description": "", "title": "SPURGE Tree Planting 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-08-10T08:51:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "AZh3Niab9Co", "description": "Jocasta finds her Dionysian side and explains her picture about her emotions at the moment.", "title": "Jocasta Entry Two", "publishedDate": "2012-10-29T21:26:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "AZhbYz_02hY", "description": "Pietri Bass specs:\n \u2022 34\" scale\n \u2022 Black transparent sunburst/fade finish\n \u2022 Solid Caribbean Mahogany body (single piece)\n \u2022 Maga wood fretboard (Thespesia grandiflora)\n \u2022 Sperzel locking tuners\n \u2022 Brass nut\n \u2022 Stainless steel medium frets\n \u2022 2 way truss rod\n \u2022 Greenlip Abalone inlay material\n \u2022 EMG 35DC pickups\n \u2022 EMG BQC controls/preamp\n \u2022 18v electrical system\n \u2022 Kahler 7400 tremolo bridge\n \u2022 Marvel straplocks\n  \nTesting out the new prototype \"Murcielago\" bass guitar at a local music store.

I'm Jeanie Tse. I'm here to speak with you about mental illnesses that are often confused with schizophrenia. There are many different illnesses that can cause what we call psychotic symptoms. Those include delusions, feeling paranoid, that people are out to hurt you, or feeling grandiose, feeling that you are maybe more important then you are, that there's a mission to accomplish, or so forth, and hallucinations, where you hear or see things that people don't hear or see. Those things also occur in bipolar disorder and in major depression as well.\n \nAnd maybe it's a bit artificial how we've divvied this up in psychiatry and in the diagnostic and statistical manual. But, basically, if you have primarily depressive moods, even if you hear voices as part of them or even if you feel paranoid as part of them, if it's a depression that comes and then goes, then that's actually depression, not schizophrenia. \n\nIf you have a depressed and a manic picture, where sometimes you have increased energy and don't sleep and are a bit reckless with your activity, and have voices and paranoia, then you may have bipolar disorder instead. \n\nThe thing that makes schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder different than bipolar disorder or depression is actually that you have these delusions or hallucinations in the absence of any mood symptoms. Those things are often confused. \n\nSometimes, people will have one psychotic episode, comes out of the blue. They hear voices. They feel paranoid. And then it goes away. That's not schizophrenia. Just because you've had one brief psychotic episode does not mean that you're going to have schizophrenia and that this is going to be with you for the rest of your lift. In fact, what we also require to make the diagnosis is a gradual decline in functioning that occurs over a longer period of time. \n\nIn addition, there's been a lot of confusion because the name schizophrenia in Greek means split mind, that split personalities are involved in schizophrenia. In fact, that's totally not true. What we think about when we talk about split personalities, having a few different identities is actually called dissociative identity disorder, and it's also actually a fairly controversial diagnosis. \n\nSometimes, people confuse autism and schizophrenia as well. Autism is a developmental disorder where people have more difficulty with social skills and social awareness. And that can look a lot like schizophrenia. Some people with autism also have schizophrenia, but people with autism do not generally have all of the paranoia and hallucinations that someone with schizophrenia has. \n\nWhen we are trying to determine if somebody has schizophrenia, we also need to rule out whether the psychotic symptoms, or the decline that we're seeing, are due to a mental illness only, or if they're actually due to a substance that the person is using. Things like amphetamines or LSD, phencyclidine which is angel dust, PCP, or sometimes even marijuana can mimic the symptoms of schizophrenia. So, we have to rule that out. And then, many medical conditions, especially ones that affect the brain, like lupus or Parkinson's disease or dementia, can look schizophrenia as well. So, we have to rule that out before we can make the diagnosis.", "title": "Illnesses Confused with Schizophrenia | Schizophrenia", "publishedDate": "2013-08-24T01:53:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "AZjKow7uVRw", "description": "Berta estuvo con una de las protagonistas del prox\u00f3mo reality de laSexta que se estrena este domingo a las 23:15 h. y la Jessy lo dio todo, a ritmo de \"vamos loqui\" ya nos dej\u00f3 clara su humor y energ\u00eda.", "title": "SLQH: A tope de Power con las Princesas", "publishedDate": "2011-02-04T19:05:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "AZjrPaIDYQM", "description": "Snr.

Traditional medical treatments focus on the long term usage of antibiotics which can cause more damage for young children's developing bodies. Much of the research has shown that the nerve signal to the tissues in the ureter that prevent this reflux is decreased. This nerve signal comes from the nerve that reside in the low back (L1/L2 nerve roots) and the pelvis (S1-S3 nerve roots). Chiropractic care can help to restore this nerve function and restore proper function to the bladder so that families can embrace life without having to worry about impending surgery or long term medications", "title": "Dr. Andrea Schnowske of AlignLife Peoria discusses the cause of Vesicoureteral Urinary Reflux", "publishedDate": "2013-09-06T21:42:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "AZsl8GPZ26U", "description": "View the entire video at: http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/\nJeffrey Frank, author of Ike and Dick: Portrait of a Strange Political Marriage, talks to former Nixon Presidential Library director Tim Naftali about the difficult relationship between President Dwight D.

Am\n25. L\u00e4ndlermusikanten-Treffen demonstrierten elf Formationen die Vielfalt der Schweizer Volksmusik auf h\u00f6chstem Niveau. Die Aula war praktisch ausverkauft.\nOKP Philipp Schuler und seine \u00abZ\u00fcndh\u00f6lzli-Musig\u00bb d\u00fcrfen stolz sein. Ihr Anlass war in allen Belangen ein Vollerfolg, und vor allem in der Besetzung in keiner Art und Weise eine Kopie der vorg\u00e4ngigen Veranstaltungen. \u00abBisher haben 50 Formationen bei uns gespielt, und keine war zweimal dabei\u00bb, so Philipp Schuler. Faktisch heisst das, dass auch die Gruppen vom Samstag definitiv Geschichte am L\u00e4ndlermusikanten-Treffen sind, und so darf man schon jetzt gespannt sein, mit welchen Kapazit\u00e4ten bei einer eventuellen Fortsetzung zu rechnen ist. Moderiert wurde der Abend durch Beat Schibig, der nicht nur vieles\n\u00fcber die Musikanten zu berichten wusste, sondern auch mit tr\u00e4fen Spr\u00fcchen kommentierte. Die aus der ganzen Schweiz angereisten Gruppen haben mit ihren gekonnten Darbietungen die Musikvielfalt der Schweiz dokumentiert. Es waren Virtuosen an der Arbeit, und diese machten\nnicht einfach ihren Job als Musikanten, sondern aus Leidenschaft zum traditionellen, konzertanten Volksgut.\nhttp://www.zuendhoelzli-musig.ch/\n\nDas Schwyzer\u00f6rgelitrio Rigigruess wie es am Anfang bestand, wurde sozusagen durch die Steiner Chilbi gegr\u00fcndet. Alex K\u00fcttel wollte am Wettbewerb um das Goldene \u00d6rgeli 2007 mitmachen und so fragte er spontan Nicole Schilter an. Beide spielen mit viel Leidenschaft die alten Josef Stump / Balz Schmidig T\u00e4nze. Nicole erlernte das Schwyzer\u00f6rgelispiel bei Seebi Schmidig, Alex bei seinem Vater Marcel K\u00fcttel. Sp\u00e4ter durfte er bei Alois L\u00fc\u00f6nd von den Mosibueb\u00e4 einige St\u00fccke lernen. Man \u00fcberredete spontan Leandra Betschart-Meyer als Begleiterin am Kontrabass. Nach der Steiner Chilbi entschloss sich das Trio weiterhin zu musizieren. Allerdings wollte sich nun Leandra, welche auch bei Seebi Schmidig Musiksch\u00fclerin war, zu Nicole und Alex ans Schwyzer\u00f6rgeli gesellen.

To get MORE information, go to http://VisionInsurance.com and you can get much more info.\n\nThe topic of this video is: If I Get Contact Lenses, Will I Get A 1-2 Year Supply Of Them? \n\n\nHere is some of what is discussed in this video: \n\nCharlie: I used to wear contact lenses many years ago, but I decided to go with glasses. These days from a top-of-the-line vision insurance company, if I want contact lenses, am I going to get a year or two supply of contacts?\n\nKathy: A top-of-the-line vision insurance company is going to have some different options for the employer as far as an allowance towards contacts. Benefits can be structured differently. You want to make sure that you know this before you make any purchases or have any appointments for vision care. \n\nYou want to find out if your plan is structured so that you have coverage for a routine eye glass exam and a contact lens exam and contact lenses, or if you have an allowance towards an exam and contact lenses. \n\nWhen you have an allowance towards contact lenses, an exam fee may be taken out of that and you can use the remaining balance towards contact lenses. That doesn't guarantee you the number of contact lenses that you're going to get, whether it be a couple of pairs, a couple of boxes, or if it's going to be a week supply, a month supply, a year supply. \n\nSome insurance companies make you purchase contact lenses from what's called a formulary, that's similar to in the prescription-drug industry where they have formulary drugs and you can only get certain drug prescriptions from your doctor. \n\nIt's the same with contact lenses, some insurance companies say you are only permitted to have these contact lens brands. So if you've been wearing this particular brand for years and years...\n\nCharlie: And those felt good, but now they say you can't do that? \n\nKathy: Right. You can only pick a particular brand. A top-of-the-line insurance company isn't going to limit like that, they're going to leave the choice of the contact lenses up to the eye care professional, they're going to allow the eye care professional to prescribe the type of contact lenses that are best for you, not the type that the insurance company says is the less expensive brand.\n\nCharlie: I always like it when the choice is up to the doctor and not up to the insurance company. \n\n\n\n- - - - -\n\nYou know you need great vision and eye care is vital. PLUS, getting an eye exam can help determine other physical problems like MS (in addition to glaucoma and other diseases of the eyes).\n\nCompanies and nonprofits often offer Vision Insurance as a benefit to their employees and associates. But not too many people know much about it, so this series was created. \n\nEye glasses, contact lenses, and good vision health - learn more in this series by going to http://VisionInsuranceUpdate.com\n\n\nhttp://youtu.be/A_CGP8HVkhc\n\nhttps://plus.google.com/109792828777762026131?rel=author", "title": "Kathy Bourne Arlia - If I Get Contact Lenses, Will I Get A 1-2 Year Supply Of Them?", "publishedDate": "2014-07-14T16:01:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "A_CmcIu87L4", "description": "Borscht is the most important soup in Ukrainian culture, known around the whole world.

Line the pan with plastic wrap.\n2. Put marshmallows and soy milk (or milk) in a pot, put on low and stir constantly to melt the marshmallows (it takes about 7 minutes). It bubbles up but the bubbles will fade in a minute after you stop the heat.\n3. Cream the cream cheese in a large bowl. Add (2.) 1/3 at a time and mix well.\n4. Place the bowl over a bowl of ice water. Add lemon juice, then mix until thick (about 20 minutes).\n5. Pour half of the mixture into the pan, place jam of your choice, cover with the rest of the mixture, then smooth out the surface.\n6. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 2 hours until set.

But there are also pink varieties...\n\nAllamanda is a genus of flowering plants in the dogbane family, Apocynaceae. They are native to the Americas, where they are distributed from Mexico to Argentina. Some species are familiar as ornamental plants cultivated for their large, colourful flowers. Most species produce yellow flowers; A. blanchetii bears pink. The genus name Allamanda honors the Swiss botanist and physician Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-Louis Allamand (1735--1803).\n\nPlants of the genus are evergreen trees, shrubs, or vines. They contain a white latex. The leaves are opposite or arranged in whorls of up to 5. The blades are generally oval and smooth-edged, and some are leathery or lightly hairy. The inflorescence is a compound cyme. The flower has five lobed sepals and a bell- or funnel-shaped corolla of five petals, yellow in most species. The fruit is a schizocarp containing two to four seeds.\n\nSource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Used in this way to identify exceptional discernment since the 17th century, the term began to be used as an expression of derogatory racial prejudice in the 1830s from Thomas D. Rice's performances as \"Jim Crow\".\n\nSince the American Civil War the term 'discrimination' generally evolved in American English usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable group or social category. Discernment has remained in British English as a term denoting elite status in perception and insight, often attributed to success in investment finance, or anyone with admirable choice in style, often high society leaders.\n\nDEFINITIONS: Within sociology, 'discrimination' is the prejudicial treatment of an individual based on their membership in a certain group or category. Discrimination is the actual behavior towards members of another group. It involves excluding or restricting members of one group from opportunities that are available to other groups. Moral philosophers have defined it as disadvantageous treatment or consideration. This is a comparative definition. An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against. He or she just needs to be treated worse than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to black children out of a racist attitude, he or she will be acting in a discriminatory way even if he or she actually benefits the people he discriminates against by donating some money to them.\nThe UN stance on discrimination includes a statement that: \"Discriminatory behaviors take many forms, but they all involve some form of exclusion or rejection.\"\n\nRacial discrimination differentiates between individuals on the basis of real and perceived racial differences, and has been official government policy in several countries, such as South Africa in the apartheid era, and the USA.\n\nTHEORIES about DISCRIMINATION:\nSocial theories such as Egalitarianism claim that social equality should prevail. In some societies, including most developed countries, each individual's civil rights include the right to be free from government sponsored social discrimination. Due to a belief in the capacity to perceive pain and/or suffering shared by all animals, 'abolitionist' or 'vegan' egalitarianism maintains that the interests of every individual (regardless its species), warrant equal consideration with the interests of humans, and that not doing so is \"speciesist\".\nCONSERVATIVES and ANARCHO-CAPITALIST\nIn contrast, conservative writer and law professor Matthias Storme has claimed that the freedom of discrimination in human societies is a fundamental human right, or more precisely, the basis of all fundamental freedoms and therefore the most fundamental freedom. Author Hans-Hermann Hoppe, in an essay about his book Democracy: The God That Failed, asserts that a natural social order is characterized by increased discrimination.\n\nTHE THEORY\nDiscrimination, in labeling theory, takes form as mental categorisation of minorities and the use of stereotype. This theory describes difference as deviance from the norm, which results in internal devaluation and social stigma that may be seen as discrimination. It is started by describing a 'natural' social order. It is distinguished between the fundamental principle of fascism and social democracy. The Nazis in 1930's-era Germany, the pre-1990 Apartheid government of South Africa used racial discriminatory agendas for their political ends. This practice continues with some present day governments.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "title": "against racism: get up, stand up, don't give up the fight", "publishedDate": "2009-08-06T09:46:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "A_tdtosmNN4", "description": "Album: \u041c\u044b \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442 (Single)(2011)\nGenre : Melodic Death / Power Metal\nCountry : Russia\n\nhttp://www.aventail.ru/\nhttp://vkontakte.ru/club1273813\n\n___________________________________________\n\nIf you would like me to do a logo (band) or simple artwork etc for promotions at a very good price, please check out my facebook page.\nhttp://www.facebook.com/PexonaArtNDesign?sk=wall", "title": "\u0410\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0439\u043b - \u041c\u044b \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442", "publishedDate": "2011-12-31T11:55:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "A_ttXQN0064", "description": "Rochester wins opener 6-1", "title": "Rochester Americans vs Adirondack Flames", "publishedDate": "2014-10-11T16:48:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "A_ttc6ebeuE", "description": "Twin Galaxies world recod owner/attempter John Barry fixes to give fellow high scorer Alan Bootier a piece of his mind aboot Guitar hero III guitar strap length issues.", "title": "video game high score attempts - special editorial", "publishedDate": "2008-07-01T07:40:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "A_tyJgBrL6Y", "description": "Commerical for Preventive Pest Control", "title": "Preventive Pest Control Commerical", "publishedDate": "2012-03-16T14:36:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "A_u882o66_Q", "description": "SIZARR live in Stuttgart.

Philemon was a leader in the Colossian church. This letter, which is one of the books of the New Testament, deals with forgiveness.\nIt is now generally regarded as one of the undisputed works of Paul. It is the shortest of Paul's extant letters, consisting of only 335 words in the original Greek text and 25 verses in modern English translations.\nContent and reconstruction\nPaul, who is apparently in prison (probably in either Rome or Ephesus), writes to a fellow Christian named Philemon and two of his associates: a woman named Apphia, sometimes assumed to be his wife, and a minister named Archippus (see Colossians 4:17). If the letter to the Colossians is authentically Pauline, then Philemon must live in Colossae. As a slave-owner he would have been wealthy by the standards of the early church and this explains why his house was large enough to accommodate church meetings (v. 2). Paul writes on behalf of Onesimus, Philemon's slave. Beyond that, it is not self-evident as to what has transpired. Onesimus is described as having been \"separated\" from Philemon, once having been \"useless\" to him (a pun on Onesimus's name, which means \"useful\"), and having done him wrong.\nThe dominant scholarly consensus is that Onesimus is a runaway slave who became a Christian believer. Paul now sends him back to face his aggrieved master, and strives in his letter to effect reconciliation between these two Christians. What is more contentious is how Onesimus came to be with Paul. Various suggestions have been given: Onesimus being imprisoned with Paul; Onesimus being brought to Paul by others; Onesimus coming to Paul by chance (or in the Christian view, by divine providence); or Onesimus deliberately seeking Paul out, as a friend of his master's, in order to be reconciled.\nThere is no extant information about Onesimus apart from the letter. Ignatius of Antioch mentions an Onesimus as Bishop of Ephesus in the early second century. It was suggested by some Bible scholars in the 1950s that this Onesimus is the same as the Onesimus in Paul's letter. Furthermore, it was suggested that Onesimus could have been the first to compile the letters of Paul, including the letter that gave him his own freedom as an expression of gratitude. This hypothesis could explain why the letter to Philemon (a letter written to an individual) is included alongside letters written to Christian communities.\n\nOutline\nI. Salutation (1-3)\nII.

But do we use -ful or -full at the end of words? A single l or double ll?  Ful or full?\n\nWhich is the correct spelling?\nhopeful or hopefull?\nbeautiful or beautifull?\ngrateful or gratefull?\nwonderful or wonderfull?\n\nAnswers\nHopeful\nBeautiful\nGrateful\nWonderful\n\nMost good spellers see what looks right. Did you?\n\nCan you see there's only one l in -- ful?\n-Ful in these words is called a suffix which is a little word we put on the end of words to change the meaning.\n\nSo there's only one way to spell these words and that's with a single l.\n\nBut many people aren't sure or don't know this rule and use full with double l but as we know now it's got to be with a single l. \n\nWe only use full when full when it's alone: \nFull up\nFull on\nFull marks\nA full sandwich\n \nBut when we add --ful to the ends of words it's a single l.\nBy adding the suffix ending -ful to words we can make adjectives like:\nbeautiful\nwonderful\nuseful\nsuccessful\ndreadful\ncareful\nhelpful\nfrightful\ndelightful\nforgetful\n\n\n\nWe can also add -ful to nouns:\n\nbucketful\nmouthful\nhandful\ncupful\nspoonful\npocketful\nbagful\nheadful\n\nThis is one of the most straight forward and easiest spelling rules - remember only use full when full.\n \nI hope this was useful, let me know by adding a comment below.\n \nIf you want to do a spelling test with this rule then go to my How to Spell website  www.howtospell.co.uk and click on the spelling blog link and there you'll find loads of spelling test podcasts including only use full when full.\n \nAnd don't forget to subscribe to my channel to get more videos.

Together they save each other.\n\nAnd it's funny too.", "title": "Numb Trailer - Depersonalization Disorder", "publishedDate": "2007-03-20T22:50:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "Aa67fftyYIU", "description": "we wouden weten hoe je moest hakken !", "title": "HAKKEN CYRILLA & MEREL & DONNA", "publishedDate": "2011-03-27T13:47:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "Aa6AnYmp2hM", "description": "", "title": "exemplary", "publishedDate": "2012-11-20T20:42:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "Aa6PTqE-k7k", "description": "Frequenza binaurale che sintonizza le onde cerebrali alla suddetta frequenza con effetti psico-fisici descritti a video.

(This point was driven home by the fact that while Thundercracker's colors were noticeably different from both Starscream and Skywarp, in the comics he was colored a dark, almost black shade of blue with only the colors of their wing stripes\u2014when drawn in\u2014made the two look different.) Frequently in the early issues, Thundercracker is seen fighting alongside Skywarp, although Thundercracker was shown to be a smarter fighter.\n\nOne of the original ten Decepticons that fell to Earth in the Ark. Thundercracker was reactivated and given the Earth mode of an F-15 jet. He would participate in many of the early battles against the Autobots - until a disastrous raid by Megatron led to Thundercracker, along with Starscream, Skywarp, Buzzsaw, Rumble and Frenzy, getting deactivated by Omega Supreme. In the US continuity Thundercracker was eventually rescued along with the other captive Decepticons, by Ratbat's forces, although he returned much earlier in the UK comics, where he was displaced to a limbo dimension by the arrival of future Autobots alongside Frenzy and Shockwave, where they had to work with Optimus Prime, Prowl and Ratchet to survive. He would then participate in the battles against Scorponok's Decepticons and then against the Autobots using their united force. None realised, however, that it was all a ruse by Starscream to gain the power of the Underbase for himself. The Autobots and Decepticons would then unite to stop him, but Starscream's power was too great, and Thundercracker was one of those deactivated by his former wingmate. He was not seen again until the G2 comic, where he seemingly took command of the Decepticon aerial contingent against the forces of Jhiaxus.\n\nAccording to his expanded Transformer's Universe biography, Thundercracker is unique among his fellow Decepticons in that he has a certain amount of pity for the humans they continually endanger or kill. He does not see the point of killing humans just to kill them, although he is very careful not to reveal this.

There is also a non-migratory population in central Mexico.\n\nIf you are in the southwestern U.S., traversing rough, stony terrain with shrub thickets so dense they are a challenge to walk through, you are in the realm of the Black-chinned Sparrow. This remote, rugged habitat coupled with the sparrow's unassuming habits makes it one of the least-understood bird species of the American southwest.\n\nBlack-chinned Sparrows are small, slender songbirds, measuring 5.75 inches long with a 7.75 inch wingspan and weighing about .42 ounces. Both sexes are primarily dark gray overall, like a junco, but their wings and back are brown with fine black streaks, like most sparrows. Their pinkish or flesh-colored bills are small and conical. Males have black faces and throats.\n\nVoice:  Song of high, sharp, slurred notes accelerating to rapid trill; higher and more mechanical than Field Sparrow; final trill usually rising.

Both its flowers (reddish panicles covered in funnel shaped bright green-red flowers) and yucca like foliage (blue-green leaves with fine teeth) certainly pack a punch and provide architectural interest! It should be planted in a well drained soil in full sun, and should be hardy down to about -10oC. - See more: http://www.trevenacross.co.uk/plant-centre/succulents-drought/other-succulents/beschorneria-yuccoides/#sthash.E6oDbEvD.dpuf\n\nThis plant is hardy in my garden in south Cornwall  in a fairly exposed position, but temperatures below -3C are fairly rare and my garden gets about 15 air-frosts per year. In the winter of 2008/9 it survived a freak frost of -8C with little damage exept to the outer leaves. As with most of the Agavaceae this had the benefit of making it produce dozens of offsets! It is growing in ordinary clay/loam with little added drainage. Given extreme drainage and a little shelter, it would probably be hardy to -10C. Allow pods to dry on plant; break open to collect seeds. See more: http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/59595/#b\n\nAlthough this plant is a handsome fellow in its own right it produces some quite sci-fi flowering spikes. It does not necessarily flower every year and it may only produce one or several flower spikes depending on its mood. Although Beschorneria does manage to have 'relations' with bees, it rarely sets seed. Some seed pods do begin to ripen but wind and rain inevitably knock them off. Out of all the flowers produced on the above plant, only one seed pod made it to maturity. Beschorneria yuccoideshas the annoying habit of providing both board and lodging to its main pest - the snail. The silver lining in this case is that the snails prefer the older leaves. As the snails rest deep within the plant, it is often hard to find them. The best course of action is to inspect your plant after a rainfall. The snails will be out cruising and you can pick them off at ease. See more: http://www.cooltropicalplants.com/Beschorneria-yuccoides.html\n\nBeschorneria yuccoides is a species of succulent plants belonging to the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Agavoideae. The epithet yuccoides derives from the botanical name of the genus Yucca and the suffix oides meaning \"likeness\" derived from a Greek word. Beschorneria yuccoides is a stemless plant with 20 to 35 linear, lanceolate, leathery and widened at their base leaves. They are gray-green to green, about 40--60 centimetres  long and 3.3--3.5 centimetres   wide. The leaf margins are finely denticulate. The inflorescence reaches a height of 100--180 centimetres  with a maximum of 320 centimeters. The stem and the bract are red. The flowers are 40 to 50 millimeters long. The fruits are elongated to almost spherical, 30--40 millimetres long and 15--25 millimetres   wide. See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beschorneria_yuccoides \n\nI had a small clump of Beschomeria Yuccoides which has turned to mush. It was planted in full sun in our south facing back garden and flowered last May - flowering is an amazing sight. It had grown a number of offshots which were doing nicely.I beleive when it flowers the main plant usually dies, but is then replaced by numerous offsets.

When transplanting the slips or sections of root, area therefore at least a foot apart.\n\nThe name Tansy is probably derived from the Greek Athanaton, either, says Dodoens, because it lasts so long in flower or, as Ambrosius thought, because it is capital for preserving dead bodies from corruption. It was said to have been given to Ganymede to make him never-ceasing.\n\nTansy was one of the Strewing Herbs mentioned by Tusser in 1577, and was one of the native plants dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\n\nPerhaps it found additional favor as a 'Strewing Herb' because it was said to be effectual in keeping flies away, particularly if mixed with senior leaves.\n\nParkinson grew Tansy amongst other aromatic and culinary herbs in his garden.\n\nIt is connected with some interesting old customs observed at Easter time, when even archbishops and bishops played handball with men of their congregation, and a Tansy cake was the reward of the victors. These Tansy cakes were made from the young leaves of the plant, mixed with eggs, and were thought to purify the humors of the body after the limited fare of Lent. In time, this custom obtained a kind of symbolism, and Tansies, as these cakes were called, became eaten on Easter Day as a remembrance of the bitter herbs consumed by the Jews at the Passover. Coles (1656) states the beginning of eating it in the spring is because Tansy is very wholesome after the salt fish eaten during Lent, and counteracts the ill-effects which the 'moist and cold constitution of winter has actually made on people ... though many understand it not, and some basic individuals take it for a matter of superstition to do so.'.\n\nThis balsamic plant, states Boerhaave, will supply the place of nutmegs and cinnamon, and the young leaves, shredded, act as a flavoring for puddings and omelets. Gerard informs us that Tansy Teas were extremely respected in Lent as well as Tansy puddings.\n\nVisit us at http://howtotreatherpes.info/ for more tips about herpes treatment.\n\nOur social media links:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/howtotreatherpes\nhttps://twitter.com/albertdwayner", "title": "Cure Herpes with Tansy - A Natural Flowering Plant", "publishedDate": "2014-02-22T11:24:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "AaOWRYqMQc0", "description": "www.youtube.com/TessiesParkinson", "title": "Parkinson's Disease - Dyskinesia", "publishedDate": "2014-04-20T04:31:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "AaOd7MZNqVM", "description": "Movie: Sinbad Legend of the seven Seas\nSoundtrack: Sirens\n\nFilm: Sinbad Herr der sieben Meere", "title": "Sinbad - Sirens (Soundtrack)", "publishedDate": "2012-05-19T16:07:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "AaPD6maYkx0", "description": ".  \"Lady Shorteh's Love and Guidance video clip.

Through community events, youth functions and charitable contributions, our goal is to reach out to others by carrying our message of recovery wherever we can. One such event, the Celebrate Recovery Walk, was held recently in Grand Rapids, MI to raise awareness about treatment for chemical dependency. Carrying signs with slogans like \u201cRecovery Matters\u201d and \u201cTreatment is Effective\u201d, several of the clients and staff members from BDR participated to show support for those who are struggling with addiction to drugs and alcohol.\n\nDr. Billy Taylor, one of the guest speakers at the walk, is the founder of Get Back Up, Inc., a non-profit service organization that addresses many of the challenges facing young adults in recovery. After giving an inspirational speech following the walk, he found a few minutes to sit with us and talk about the importance of events like this one. \u201cI love sharing my message of recovery,\u201d he tells us, \u201cjust to help them to know that there\u2019s life on the other side of addiction.\u201d In his speech, he compared substituting one drug for another to changing seats on an airplane that is crashing.\n\nLike many of the course facilitators and counselors at BDR, Dr. Taylor can relate to people suffering from addiction on a personal level. He has had firsthand experience with recovery from drug abuse and alcoholism, and has been substance free for over 17 years. His personal testimony and knowledge about life under the influence helps him to connect with others and spread his message more effectively.\n\nBy participating in community events like the Celebrate Recovery Walk, our clients can find support and encouragement in their own personal recovery from substance abuse. \u201cDr. Taylor\u2019s speech was really great because I could really relate to it,\u201d says Tayla, a Best Drug Rehabilitation client. \u201cI would always try to substitute my addictions and that just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d At our treatment facility, we help our clients to overcome their chemical dependency by discovering and addressing the underlying causes of their addiction rather than just treating the symptoms. In doing so, they build a stronger foundation in recovery and enjoy long term substance free living. They find a greater sense of self-confidence and hope for a brighter future. They find peace and happiness inside themselves.\n\nLearn More Here:\nhttp://www.bestdrugrehabilitation.com...\n\nBest Drug Rehabilitation\n300 Care Center Drive\nManistee, MI 49660\n\n\nFollow Best Drug Rehabilitation on Twiiter:\nhttps://twitter.com/BestDrugRehab\n\nLike Best Drug Rehabilitation on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BDROfficial\n\nCall now if you are seeking help: 1-888-820-5366", "title": "Best Drug Rehabilitation in The Celebrate Recovery Walk with Dr. Billy Taylor", "publishedDate": "2014-10-05T20:09:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "AaTmLB9Nyzk", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/ParadoxDjentBand\n\nHere's an Instrumental teaser of our EP called ''Paramnesia'' ! \n\n**THIS IS A PRE-PROD VERSION **\n\nthanks for watching!", "title": "Instrumental teaser **PRE-PROD** EP ''Paramnesia''", "publishedDate": "2013-02-07T05:54:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "AaTyzwHKh0I", "description": "OBEBOSHS RUSKOGO NARODA", "title": "VLAD THIS IS HOROSHIY BORSH.mp4", "publishedDate": "2012-06-17T18:11:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "AaU0v7ajAjU", "description": "R\u00e9alisation d'une fibre optique en g\u00e9latine alimentaire, dans le cadre des TPE en classe de 1ereS.\nSite de notre TPE :   http://idiraknouche.wix.com/fibre-optique", "title": "TPE EXPERIENCE N\u00b02 FIBRE EN GELATINE", "publishedDate": "2013-02-13T00:05:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "AaUUV7stBF4", "description": "Los Adolescentes interpretan el tema \"Dame un Poco Mas\".", "title": "DAME UN POCO MAS - LOS ADOLESCENTES [ Salsa Music ]", "publishedDate": "2012-07-02T17:10:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "AaUcDSpJMd4", "description": "What do you think?", "title": "Wry Neck?", "publishedDate": "2012-05-14T01:06:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "AaUdLtT3ssA", "description": "Dr. Diane Schuller discusses the connection between stress and asthma with a personal story about a young patient suffering from cough variant asthma.

Most smoked meats are cured with lots of salt and sugar, and plenty of other things we probably shouldn't indulge in on a regular basis.\n\nHere is a really easy recipe for collard greens that don't require any meat nor a lot of time.

Unbeholfen versucht er, die Beziehung zu seinen T\u00f6chtern, der altklugen 10-j\u00e4hrigen Scottie (Amara Miller) und der rebellischen 17-j\u00e4hrigen Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), wieder zu verbessern, w\u00e4hrend er gleichzeitig mit der Entscheidung ringt, ob er den Grundbesitz seiner Familie verkaufen soll. Von Mitgliedern der hawaiianischen K\u00f6nigsfamilie und Missionaren haben die Kings vor Generationen unsch\u00e4tzbar wertvolles Land erhalten, das zu den letzten unber\u00fchrten tropischen Strandabschnitten auf den Inseln geh\u00f6rt.\n\nAls Alexandra die Bombe platzen l\u00e4sst und enth\u00fcllt, dass ihre Mutter zum Zeitpunkt des Unfalls mitten in einer Aff\u00e4re mit einem anderen Mann steckte, muss Matt innerhalb einer Woche voller wichtiger Entscheidungen sein Leben, ganz zu schweigen von seinem Verm\u00e4chtnis, pl\u00f6tzlich mit v\u00f6llig anderen Augen betrachten.\n\nMit seinen T\u00f6chtern im Schlepptau begibt er sich relativ planlos auf die Suche nach dem Liebhaber seiner Frau. Unterwegs, nach Begegnungen der komischen, \u00e4rgerlichen und transzendenten Art, wird ihm bewusst, dass er endlich den richtigen Kurs eingeschlagen hat, um sein Leben und seine Familie neu zu ordnen.\n\n\nThe Descendants trailer german / The Descendants trailer deutsch / The Descendants Kritik / The Descendants Filmkritik / The Descendants deutscher trailer / Film Kritik Kino Review Filmkritik Trailer DVD Shailene Woodley George Clooney The Descendants 2012 Oscar Oscars", "title": "THE DESCENDANTS | Trailer german deutsch & Kritik [HD]", "publishedDate": "2012-01-25T18:21:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "AabOEzjWLGc", "description": "At least 25 FEMEN activists were arrested in Paris on Sunday after rallying topless in front of the Palace of Justice in protest against the sentence given to fellow activist Iana Zhdanova for \"exhibitionism\" on October 15.

Pervasively melancholic yet profoundly astute in its attention to instrumental detail, Brion's score most flowers when embracing the unconventional: the soulful three-part \"Piano One,\" \"Piano Two\" and \"Piano Three\"; the boozy lounge songs \"Little Person\" and \"Song for Caden\"; the music hall throwback chorus of \"Schenectady\"; the soul-searing sadness of \"Still Can't Return (Still Trying)\" all playing their part in this smart musical underscore to Kaufman's symphony of uncertainty.", "title": "Synecdoche, New York - Jon Brion - \"Someone Else's Forward Motion\"", "publishedDate": "2013-12-02T19:42:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "AagdXaSk89c", "description": "@ Central Christian Church, Dec. 1st, 2006\n\nbad sound quality, but still fun to watch!!", "title": "ITHIEL - 'Above The Unrisen' (my old band back in 2006)", "publishedDate": "2008-05-05T05:16:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "AagjjyKNPCU", "description": "There are 2 species of  Swallow-wort that are growing and taking over the natural landscape in New York State.

This is being done under the Department of Energy's Openness Initiative. The film project is being carried out by DOE's Albuquerque Operations Office (AL) in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).\n\nComing out of World War II, the U.S. and its allies realized they were in a Cold War with the Soviet Union. The first atomic bomb had been tested successfully at the Trinity Site in southeastern New Mexico in July 1945 and the second and third bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in August 1945, bringing about a speedy end to World War II. U.S. officials knew that the Soviet Union was on a fast track to develop the \"bomb\" and that they must develop more sophisticated nuclear weapons to stay ahead of the Soviet Union in the Cold War.\n\nWith the backing of the Executive Branch and Congress, the Army's Manhattan Engineer District (MED), which designed, developed and tested the first atomic bomb, embarked on a nuclear testing program in 1946 at the newly established Pacific Proving Ground in the Marshall Islands area. The MED was dissolved in 1947 and its duties and functions were given to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). The DoD joined the AEC in Joint Task Forces which continued the atmospheric testing program. This program allowed rapid gains in knowledge about weapons development, military effects, fallout and radiation effects, biomedical science, nuclear science, and delivery systems.\n\nAL, a field office of the AEC, opened the Nevada Proving Ground northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1951 to reduce the cost of nuclear testing. The cost of transporting supplies, scientific gear, and materials for housing and testing, and for keeping a work force in the Pacific was monumental. The name of the Nevada Proving Ground was changed in 1957 to the Nevada National Security Site.\n\nIn hindsight, the AEC and the DoD made many mistakes in the testing program, such as underestimating the effects of fallout and deploying troops in areas of excessive radiation. Despite the errors in the early testing efforts, the U.S. surged ahead of all other nations in nuclear weapons capabilities, and gained the expertise which now sets the standard for what is \"safe.\"\n\nAlthough the Soviet Union mounted a massive attempt to gain a distinct advantage in nuclear military power, the U.S. maintained a deterrent to nuclear aggression. The U.S. now has a smaller but more sophisticated nuclear weapons stockpile, which the DOE manages jointly with the DoD. Through treaties, nuclear testing has been discontinued.\"\nhttp://www.nv.doe.gov/library/films/fulltext/0800000.aspx", "title": "Nuclear Testing Review", "publishedDate": "2013-08-16T18:00:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "AatkD5_NKPQ", "description": "Krush Klamath in Mexico", "title": "Krush Klamath - The Great Escape", "publishedDate": "2008-04-28T20:17:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "Aau9SkC0jEQ", "description": "Honda gx200 Margay race kart.\n\nThe motor is fully built, ported and milled head, large stainless valves, flat top Honda racing piston, NR racing cam, billet con rod and flywheel, blueprinted gx390 carb.

Tambi\u00e9n conocido como indigesti\u00f3n, empacho o malestar estomacal, es un t\u00e9rmino que describe el malestar o dolor en el abdomen superior. No es una enfermedad. La dispepsia es un grupo de s\u00edntomas que a menudo son distensi\u00f3n abdominal, n\u00e1useas y eructos. La indigesti\u00f3n es generalmente causada cuando el \u00e1cido del est\u00f3mago entra en contacto con la mucosa del aparato digestivo - el revestimiento de protecci\u00f3n sensible del sistema digestivo. Los \u00e1cidos del est\u00f3mago descomponen la mucosa, causando irritaci\u00f3n y la inflamaci\u00f3n, lo que desencadena los s\u00edntomas de la indigesti\u00f3n.
