Their goal was to offer great utility and quality in a rugged high-value locking liner folder. We think they've met the sport knife goal in Ken's new aluminum-framed Shenanigan. \n\nEven though Ken is known for his assisted opening folders, in this case, the combination of the open-build frame, blade flipper, and Teflon and bronze bushings at the pivot allow for fast one hand opening in an exceptional knife. \n\nAll models feature 3.25\" long blades with a classic Ken Onion profile. There is a modified drop point with a slight recurve and a swedged top edge. \n\nThe Shenanigan PPS offers the workhorse AUS 8 blade steel in a bead-blast finish, plus a frame of polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) organic polymer. This is a rugged, value-priced knife that can be used daily on the job. It is one that will take the worst abuse from impacts, abrasion, and solvents and still look good. The combination of contoured handle, index finger notch and checkered grip pattern make the Shenanigan models very friendly to the hands. \n\nThe combination of contoured handle, index finger notch and checkered grip pattern make the Shenanigan models very friendly to the hands.", "title": "CRKT Ken Onion Shenanigan Knife", "publishedDate": "2011-05-09T18:45:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "55DSEZnHqas", "description": "For auction is a Breitling Navitimer 92 Telemeter A30022 B30 38MM Rubber 30M Tritium.

Today, we are in Mahabalipuram in India, and I am going to show you some ancient drilling that's even stranger.  How about drilling a giant hole that is 8 feet wide on a granite rock?\n\n As we know Granite is one of the hardest rocks in the world and today we use diamond tipped tools and laser to make drills in it. How could they drill a humongous hole like this 1300 years ago? \n\nWith a diameter of 8 feet, you can see how perfect it looks. The circumference is a perfect circle. And the hole is 5 feet deep. Academics think that this was carved with chisels and hammers. Think about this, this drill was done at least 1300 years ago, when the value of PI was not even invented. According to conventional history, People did not use any complex tools. But how can a perfect circle that is 8 feet wide be carved on a rock. If they had to use chisels and hammers, where would you even start the carving? \n\nIf it was true, at one point, there must have been a dozen people sitting inside this chiseling away to make it a perfect circle. This would have taken years. Let me show you the walls, and you can see that there are no imperfections at all. It looks so smooth and looks like it is made with a modern machine.\n\nNow, here is a bigger question. Why would they need to create a perfect cylinder out of a rock? If you wanted a well for water, you can dig one with much less manual labor. If you wanted to create a water tank, you can just use pots or metal vessels. Why would you need to create something like this out of a granite rock?\n\nAnd what is the reason behind making it a perfect circle? I mean even water wells or tanks don't need this much of effort. Was it used to fit something that was a perfect cylinder? I have asked several people here and nobody knows the reason behind this giant hole drilled out of this rock. I would really appreciate if you can tell me why such a thing would be needed.\n\nPlease visit http://www.phenomenalplace.com for intriguing and interesting places on the planet.", "title": "Ancient Drilling Technology - Mahabalipuram, India", "publishedDate": "2014-05-30T14:30:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "55FIGF8mU0M", "description": "Ajnai huur / \u0410\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0439 \u0445\u0443\u0443\u0440 09", "title": "Ajinai huur / \u0410\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0439 \u0445\u0443\u0443\u0440 09 Durvun oirdiin uria", "publishedDate": "2013-05-31T12:23:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "55FdeYxETJg", "description": "\u041e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433 \"\u0420\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0430\" http://www.shareware-steps.ru\n\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u044f \u041a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f,\n\u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \"\u0424\u0438\u043d\u0442\u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431: \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439\"(www.fintclub.ru) \u0438 \u0428\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0416\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438(http://school.promoteen.com/),\n\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0443\u0447(http://take.easy-money.biz/),\n\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439.", "title": "\u0420\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0430 - \u043e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433 shareware-steps.ru", "publishedDate": "2011-06-08T20:41:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "55FgdU6SAMY", "description": "O Tovacu\u00e7u \u00e9 a maior esp\u00e9cie da fam\u00edlia grallaridae, mede cerca de 21cm.\n\u00c9 bastante ouvido em matas preservadas, por\u00e9m muito pouco visto.", "title": "Tovacu\u00e7u (Grallaria varia) - Variegated Antpitta", "publishedDate": "2014-04-18T00:39:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "55FkNI8ory4", "description": "Classic re-enactment of the famous Pine Tar incident in 1983.", "title": "Pine Tar Incident", "publishedDate": "2008-03-21T06:07:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "55GAUgjpDQA", "description": "Music video by Justin Moore performing If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away.

The discovery of infrared light can be dated back to the 19th century. Since then, scientists have established various ways to utilize infrared light. Infrared absorption spectroscopy is the method which scientists use to determine the structures of molecules with the molecules' characteristic absorption of infrared radiation. Infrared spectrum is molecular vibrational spectrum. When exposed to infrared radiation, sample molecules selectively absorb radiation of specific wavelengths which causes the change of dipole moment of sample molecules. Consequently, the vibrational energy levels of sample molecules transfer from ground state to excited state. The frequency of the absorption peak is determined by the vibrational energy gap. The number of absorption peaks is related to the number of vibrational freedom of the molecule. The intensity of absorption peaks is related to the change of dipole moment and the possibility of the transition of energy levels. Therefore, by analyzing the infrared spectrum, one can readily obtain abundant structure information of a molecule. Most molecules are infrared active except for several homonuclear diatomic molecules such as O2, N2 and Cl2 due to the zero dipole change in the vibration and rotation of these molecules. What makes infrared absorption spectroscopy even more useful is the fact that it is capable to analyze all gas, liquid and solid samples. The common used region for infrared absorption spectroscopy is 4000 ~ 400 cm-1 because the absorption radiation of most organic compounds and inorganic ions is within this region. \n\nFTIR spectrometers are the third generation infrared spectrometer. FTIR spectrometers have several prominent advantages: (1) The signal-to-noise ratio of spectrum is significantly higher than the previous generation infrared spectrometers. (2) The accuracy of wavenumber is high. The error is within the range of \u00b1 0.01 cm-1. (3) The scan time of all frequencies is short (approximately 1 s). (4) The resolution is extremely high (0.1 ~ 0.005 cm-1). (5) The scan range is wide (1000 ~ 10 cm-1). (6) The interference from stray light is reduced. Due to these advantages, FTIR Spectrometers have replaced dispersive IR spectrometers.\n\nA common FTIR spectrometer consists of a source, interferometer, sample compartment, detector, amplifier, A/D convertor, and a computer. The source generates radiation which passes the sample through the interferometer and reaches the detector. Then the signal is amplified and converted to digital signal by the amplifier and analog-to-digital converter, respectively. Eventually, the signal is transferred to a computer in which Fourier transform is carried out.

He entered the Conservatoire de Paris at the age of six, earning many awards, and as an adult became a famous virtuoso and teacher. Although early in his life he was socially active and good friends with prominent musicians and artists including Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Franz Liszt and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, he gradually withdrew from the concert platform after 1848, and he lived a reclusive life in Paris until his death in 1888.\n \nHis compositions for solo piano include some of the most fiendishly difficult ever written, and performers who can master them are few and far between. \"Trente Chants\" was published in 1857. and included the romantic first piece: \"Assez Vivement\" (Deeply enough).\n \nThe sweeping Assez vivement that opens the first collection of Chants would seem to be Alkan at his most straightforward -- peremptory, soaring, lyrically arresting -- until a certain nagging similarity to the first piece of Mendelssohn's first set of Lieder ohne Worte (songs without words), Op. 19, is identified, though it is more apparent to the performer than to the listener. If both place an evenly spaced melody over an accompaniment of distinctively purling arpeggios, their effects are very different; Mendelssohn's little piece is an invitation to domesticity, while Alkan's elaborately justifies his direction for playing avec grande passion. \n\nThere can be no doubt of Alkan's admiration -- he is found performing Mendelssohn's works early and late. Perhaps their similarity of temperament, tokened by a certain primness, briskness, and fastidious elegance, led Alkan to delineate his own characteristic features by direct, occasionally pathological, comparison. \n\nThe first and second collections of Chants, sharing opus number 38, were published by Richault in 1857 for piano (in E Major) however, I created this arrangement for Concert (Pedal) Harp in Eb Major.", "title": "\"Assez Vivement\" by Charles Valentin Alkan for Harp", "publishedDate": "2012-08-15T11:42:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "568LZNuCaWY", "description": "", "title": "Spot - Decile NO a la Basura", "publishedDate": "2013-09-16T13:32:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "568OtEVOCiw", "description": "ModusLink offers you an easy and seamless way to integrate recurring billing and subscription solutions.

Put together by vocalist Wullie Hammill and John Sneddon in the summer of 1979, the band were typical of the 1979/1980 punk bands--faster and rougher than the class of 77, but not an all out UK82-style attack--yet.\n\n The band played out as often as they could, evolving fully into the UK82 mold, and released two singles on the Beat the System record label in 1982 and 83, and also putting in an appearance on the Total Anarchy compilation (also in 1983). Their sound was typical of the era, kinda speedy punk with gruff vocals and anarcho-inspired lyrics abour war, the evil governments and nonconformism.\n\n That was the side of External Menace that most people knew best, but towards the middle of the 80's they branched out in a more melodic (but still hardcore) direction, playing reggae inspired tunes like \"Rude Awakening\" and \"Killing me Asylum\". While the band recorded two or three more demos, putting some of their new tracks down, they didn't manage to get any more vinyl out, and finally broke up in 1985.\n\n Fast forward to 1994--Ian Welsh of Swine Flu harassed John Sneddon to get External Menace back together, and start kicking some more punk rock ass. Sneddy agreed--but only if Welshy (what is it with Scots and diminutive names ending in Y?) joined the band as vocalist, since Wullie Hamill had died in 1987. Swine Flu disappeared shortly after their first single was released, and re-emerged with a new name and a new guitarist.

The last time we were sitting together talking, he was telling me about his most favorite thing to do, which is to bring his sons and grandsons up to Canada and go fishing. In the last few years, he's had a great deal of difficulty doing it because he's unstable when he's standing in the water. We talked about his imbalance and I knew he'd be a great candidate to go over to Fyzical for retraining. And that's what they did. They restrengthened his pelvic girdle, his legs, his arms, got his balance back in physical therapy. \n\nNow he not only wants to live, he loves life.  \n\nI find that Fyzical has a wonderful approach to the balanced patient and to problems with physical therapy in general. \n\nIt is not uncommon for the client when they're finishing the program, to be crying and tearful they're so happy.

Thinking that it was an army patrol that had set up a check post, the first of the buses stopped. According to the driver of the first bus, three other buses were stopped too. Once the bus halted, the driver was asked to get down and he was asked at gunpoint as to which community he belonged to. He replied that he was a Bihari Muslim. The militants then asked whether Nepalis were in the bus. The driver replied that it was possible. Then the militants boarded the bus and forced six of the passengers off the vehicle. All of them, except one, were a Bihari, the driver has stated. Thereafter, the militants asked the driver to leave with the bus and the rest of the passengers immediately. Meanwhile, he noticed that passengers from the other buses were being brought down too. When he still didn't leave for about couple of minutes more, the militants threatened to shoot him too. That is when he took off with the bus and rest of the passengers. He informed of the incident in the first police station on the NH 31C that he came across, which is the Sidli Police Station in the neighbouring Chirang district. Alerted by the driver and the passengers of the bus, message was passed on to Kokrajhar Police Headquarters and Serfenguri Police Station and the police teams rushed to the spot to find the dead and the injured.\n\nIt may be noted that while this may not be the first incident of Hindi speaking migrants being made targets of massacres by ethnic militants in Assam, not only by the Bodo militants, it remains to be ascertained what particular factor triggered this latest outrage.\n\nIt may however be worth taking note of that just a day earlier, in the same Kokrajhar district, public had captured a NDFB (S) militant when he had come to extort a trader who had been served a demand note of Rs. 15 lakhs (1.5 million) which he expressed inability to pay.

Now please do not go sending me link to what Egyptian myth spews about him...  They are most likely altered just like Christianity scriptures...  And how is it that Nation Rise against Nation...  which comes from the tablets, is right there in the Bible?\n\nRemember, stick to the tablets...  he wrote them so they were not altered...  Perhaps their translation has been...  But who knows..

Emite tallos le\u00f1osos aunque inicialmente tienen consistencia herb\u00e1cea. El aspecto de la planta es desordenado y ralo.\n\nLas hojas son pecioladas, enteras, de forma ovada, con el borde liso y color verde glauco.\n\nLas flores se agrupan en inflorescencias terminales con pocas unidades. Son actinomorfas y hermafroditas, con peque\u00f1as br\u00e1cteas y c\u00e1liz en forma campaniforme con l\u00f3bulos triangulares. La corola est\u00e1 formada por p\u00e9talos soldados de color amarillo, que forman un tubo largo con 5 l\u00f3bulos ovados; en su inteior est\u00e1n dispuestos los estambres y el estilo y el estigma. Los p\u00e9talos est\u00e1n densamente cubiertos de pelos cortos.\n\nEl fruto es ovoidal y queda dentro del c\u00e1liz seco. En su interior se alojan las semillas.\n\nEn la naturaleza se da en zonas degradadas, viarias y abandonadas. Es una planta invasiva en Espa\u00f1a y en muchas partes del mundo.\n\nEn jardiner\u00eda se usa como aislada por su flor y el color de sus hojas. Es r\u00fastica, aguanta sequ\u00eda, salinidad y viento. No soporta heladas fuertes.\n\nM\u00e1s cosas sobre EL GANDUL o tabaco moruno (Nicotiana glauca): http://riomoros.blogspot.com.es/2012/07/el-gandul-nicotiana-glauca.html\n\nOtro v\u00eddeo en: http://youtu.be/_P4gEsQxn3U", "title": "EL GANDUL o tabaco moruno: Nicotiana glauca (http://riomoros.blogspot.com.es)", "publishedDate": "2012-07-05T11:43:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "56nhxibG5x8", "description": "Using minitube of america five day extender..this is a sample I saved of a shipment of fresh chilled that has been in my fridge five days... semen is still very active and mobile...", "title": "Harry Semen five days in fridge in 5 day ext", "publishedDate": "2014-02-21T14:20:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "56niO61ogOU", "description": "Hosta\nAuthor: Heather Lappe", "title": "Hosta hybrids - Hosta", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T06:26:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "56noDDd0QXU", "description": "Deuxi\u00e8me succ\u00e8s pour Charlotte Julian apr\u00e8s \"fleur de province\"...", "title": "Charlotte Julian - Tarte molle (1972)", "publishedDate": "2011-11-01T12:16:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "56npXVFUYXI", "description": "This was my first Race with GRC and it was at Charlotte Speedway.

The 11 species of badger are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (9 Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel) and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus european), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae. Badgers include the species in the genera Meles, Arctonyx, Taxidea and Mellivora. Their lower jaws are articulated to the upper by means of transverse condyles firmly locked into long cavities of the skull, so dislocation of the jaw is all but impossible. This enables the badgers to maintain their hold with the utmost tenacity, but limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut, or sliding from side to side without the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most mammals. Badgers have rather short, fat bodies, with short legs for digging. They have elongated weasel-like heads with small ears. Their tails vary in length depending on species; the stink badger has a very short tail, while the ferret badger's tail can be 46--51 cm long, depending on age. They have black faces with distinctive white markings, gray bodies with a light-coloured stripe from head to tail, and dark legs with light coloured stomachs. They grow to around 90 centimetres in length including tail. The European badger is one of the largest; the American badger, the hog badger and the honey badger are generally a little smaller and lighter. The stink badgers are smaller still, and the ferret badgers are the smallest of all. They weigh around on average, with some Eurasian badgers weighing in at around The diet of the Eurasian badger consists largely of earthworms, insects, grubs, and the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds. funny animal animals crazy craziest insane blooper bloopers fail fails dam dams beaver beavers rodent rodents danger dangers rabid rabies disease diseases diseased swim swims swimming swimmer swimmers water waters waterfall waterfalls falls niagra ontario canada cottage cottages country cute cutest cub cubs mice mouse rat rats bite bites attack attacks hunt hunts hunter hunters hunting cook cooking eat eats eating cooks fire trap traps trapping pest pests snare snares fish fishing fisher fishers fisherman fishermen weasels, stoats, ferrets and otters They also eat small mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds, as well as roots and fruit. In Britain, they are the only predator honey rock of hedgehogs, which have demonstrably lower populations in areas where badgers are numerous, so that hedgehog rescue societies will not release hedgehogs into known badger territories. In some areas they are known to predate lambs, and may bite a ewe defending her lamb, almost always leading to infection of the bite. They are occasional predators of domestic chickens, and are able to break into enclosures that a fox cannot. In southern Spain, badgers feed to a significant degree on rabbits. The honey badger of Africa consumes honey, porcupines and even venomous snakes (such as the puff adder); they will climb trees to gain access to honey from bees' nests. American badgers are fossorial carnivores -- i.e. they catch a significant proportion of their food underground, by digging. They can tunnel after ground-dwelling rodents at speed. Badgers have been known to become intoxicated with alcohol after eating rotting fruit. Hunting badgers has been common in many countries. The Dachshund dog breed was bred as a badger hound; Dachs is the German word for badger The blood sport of badger-baiting was outlawed in the United Kingdom by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, and the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 made it a serious offence to kill, injure or take a badger, or to damage or interfere with a sett unless a licence is obtained from a statutory authority. An exemption that allowed fox hunters to loosely block setts to prevent chased foxes escaping into them was brought to an end with the Hunting Act 2004. Badgers can be fierce animals and will protect themselves and their young at all costs, are capable of fighting off dog-packs and fighting off much larger animals, such as wolves and bears. However, badgers can be tamed and then kept as pets Today, badgers are commercially trapped for their pelts, which are used to make shaving brushes and clothing. Badger hair is particularly suited for shaving brushes due to its water retention. Virtually all commercial badger hair comes from mainland China, which supplies knots of hair in three grades to brush makers in both China and Europe. In rural Northern China, badgers multiplied to the point of becoming a crop nuisance, and village cooperatives are licensed by the national government to hunt badgers and process their hair", "title": "Badger got scared and ran away!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T16:02:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "571RYR1nMDM", "description": "How to pronounce # Dried leguminous vegetables - created at http://goanimate.com/", "title": "How to pronounce # Dried leguminous vegetables", "publishedDate": "2013-11-07T23:56:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "571duDYp5gE", "description": "CRY BABY CRY je autorsk\u00e1 inscenace hereck\u00e9ho kolektivu \u0160vandova divadla.\nP\u011bt \u017een se v n\u011bm na dnes tak popul\u00e1rn\u00edm kurzu life coachingu pokus\u00ed zjistit, jak by m\u011bly zm\u011bnit sv\u016fj \u017eivot.

In floriography, it represents gratitude, or faith and constancy.\n\nThe genus Latin name (\"campanula\"), meaning small bell, refers to the bell-shape of the flower, while the specific epithet (\"medium\") means that this plant has intermediate characteristics in respect of other species of the same genus.\n\nCampanula medium reaches approximately 60--80 centimetres (24--31 in) in height. This biennial herbaceous plant forms rosettes of leaves in the first year, stems and flowers in the second one. The stem is erect, robust, reddish-brown and bristly hairy. The basal leaves are stalked and lanceolate to elliptical and 12--15 centimetres (4.7--5.9 in) long with serrated leaf edge. The upper leaves are smaller, lanceolate and sessile, almost embracing the stem.\n\nThe flowers are arranged in a racemose inflorescence of extremely long lasting blooms. These attractive bell-shaped flowers are short-stalked, large and hermaphroditic, with different shades of violet-blue or rarely white. The corolla has five fused petals with lightly bent lobes.\n\nSource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

In this video, you will see \n-difficulty controlling the head and neck\n-the need for greater support in the seated position\n-positioning and repositioning in order to maintain the seated position\n-random, non-purposeful movements of the left arm\n-crackles and rhonchi while breathing due to chronic congestion\n-wide eyes and attentiveness, though she had been blind for over a year\nAt 2-1/2, Rachaeli was able to move her head from side to side with relative ease. She could lift and move her extremities, but this was random, with no particular intent. She could prop-sit for very brief periods, but only if properly positioned. She was alert and appeared to be able to follow or track with her eyes and head, even though she lost her vision at about 18 months.\nAt this age, Rachaeli was having seizures on a regular basis and was treated with Klonopin, which helped with seizures, her exaggerated startle reflex, and muscle stiffness/hypertonia. She received nutrition by tube feedings only, due to weakness of the swallowing muscles and resultant aspiration of food and fluid into the lungs if taken orally. She was given nebulizer treatments around the clock to open her airways, loosen secretions to make them easier to suction, and prevent infections from settling in lungs.  \n-Physical Therapy is critical in children with Tay-Sachs in order to prevent muscle contractures, improve range of motion at joints, and maintain motor strength and flexibility. Most importantly, PT will help maintain overall muscle strength, including the muscles required for breathing. \n-Since many children with Tay-Sachs succumb to pneumonias, it is important to both maintain muscular strength and reposition the child throughout the day (sitting, standing in a stander, and if lying down, flipping from side to side).", "title": "Tay-Sachs Physical Therapy: Rachaeli at age 2-1/2", "publishedDate": "2012-01-11T08:57:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "57SIpmA3vcg", "description": "When it comes to programming \"concepts\" are often valued by interviewers as a way to demonstrate you understand how things work, not just how they operate.

It is hard and very brittle, difficult to fuse, but easy to oxidize. Manganese metal and itsmon ions are paramagnetic. The most important manganese ore is pyrolusite (MnO2). Other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial relation to the iron ores.\n\n The primary product of the smelting process outlined above is a carbon-saturated ferroalloy containing 76 to 80 percent manganese, 12 to 15 percent iron, up to 7.5 percent carbon, and up to 1.2 percent silicon. It can be produced by two methods. In the first, ores are selected on the basis of their acidity so that, on smelting, 70 to 80 percent of the manganese is recovered in the melt while a slag containing 30 to 42 percent manganese is also obtained. (This slag can be resmelted to produce silanganese; see below.) The second method, which employs basic ores or fluxes, recovers 85 to 90 percent of the metal and generates a slag low enough in manganese to be discarded. The first method consumes 2,400 to 2,800 kilowatt-hours of electric power per ton of product, while the second, reflecting the higher energy needed to calcine the fluxes and continue smelting to a higher recovery of metal, consumes 2,600 to 3,100 kilowatt-hours per ton.\n\n GEMCO accounts for more than 15 per cent of the world's high-grade ore production with approximately 70 per cent of its production exported around the globe. One of the GEMCO key assets is its own Port facility owned and operated by GEMCO in close proximity to the Asia market.\n\n In manganese base ferroalloy smelting , the manganese and ferrum are useful elements in manganese ore. The key indicator to measure the quality of manganese ore stone is manganese content. The ferrum content should have certain proportion with manganese content..", "title": "manganese ore mining methods", "publishedDate": "2012-09-18T13:39:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "57i-K8kVZ68", "description": "Warning Shots (2007)", "title": "J-Stalin - I'm Just Sayin Though", "publishedDate": "2008-10-01T18:37:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "57i2lDKRSzQ", "description": "al-quenelle tv toujours et encore a la recherche des petites quenelle ou les auto quenelle  gliss\u00e9e dans les m\u00e9dia !", "title": "LE PLUS GROS BIDE DE TOUT LES TEMPS A LA TV FRANCAISE", "publishedDate": "2012-06-14T19:54:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "57icMkc0rIY", "description": "", "title": "Peristalsis Process", "publishedDate": "2014-04-13T05:11:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "57ij6CXHUYw", "description": "Voici les capsules de C-Drik\ndans le cadre de son nouvel album La vieille \u00e9cole\nqui est en vente partout.\n\nPour avoir C-Drik dans vos \u00e9v\u00e8nements:\nbooking@ukase.ca\n\n\nPour plus d'informations concernant C-Drik\nwww.ukase.ca", "title": "\u00c9pisode #2   1de2                 Saison1            Les capsules \u00e0 C-Drik", "publishedDate": "2011-08-12T15:01:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "57j7gAEeIjw", "description": "Filmado na Faz.

But they are also opposites, with gravely different futures ahead. It is the 1960s, and Udayan\u2014charismatic and impulsive\u2014finds himself drawn to the Naxalite movement, a rebellion waged to eradicate inequity and poverty; he will give everything, risk all, for what he believes. Subhash, the dutiful son, does not share his brother's political passion; he leaves home to pursue a life of scientific research in a quiet, coastal corner of America. \n\nBut when Subhash learns what happened to his brother in the lowland outside their family's home, he goes back to India, hoping to pick up the pieces of a shattered family, and to heal the wounds Udayan left behind\u2014including those seared in the heart of his brother's wife.\n\nMasterly suspenseful, sweeping, piercingly intimate, The Lowland is a work of great beauty and complex emotion; an engrossing family saga and a story steeped in history that spans generations and geographies with seamless authenticity.

Within this region of bright stars we find the spiral galaxy known as Messier 101 or the Pinwheel Galaxy.\n\nWhile it takes a fairly large telescope as well as dark skies to view, the Pinwheel is quite an impressive galaxy.\n\n M101 was first discovered by the French astronomer and surveyor Pierre Mechain in 1781 who later reported his findings to Charles Messier. Charles Messier added the galaxy as the 101st object to his famous catalogue, thus the title: Messier, or M101.\n\nIt's very large, and believed to be twice the size of our own Milky Way. At an estimated 25 million light years away, a trip to M101 would take over 400 billion years... even traveling at the speed of our fastest spacecraft.\n\nIn photographs of this beautiful creation, we notice that the Pinwheel's rings are not symmetrical all the way around the nucleus or center of the galaxy.\n\nAnother galaxy known as NGC 5474, is of particular interest because it has the closest proximity to The Pinwheel Galaxy in the M101 group. Some people believe that this galaxy may have played a part in the asymmetrical shape of the Pinwheel due to its gravitational pull.\n\nThese galaxies are just two examples of the creative power of God in the vast expanse of the universe.\n\nOur tiny, seemingly insignificant position on a little rock called Earth is so much more special than these other grand galaxies: \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"\n\nI'm David Rives...\nTruly, The Heavens Declare the Glory of God.\n\nSUBSCRIBE (above) for new inspirational videos every Thursday!\nLIKE David's FB page here: http://www.facebook.com/DavidRivesMinistries\nFOLLOW us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/TheDavidRives\nVISIT our official website for tons of free information: http://www.davidrivesministries.org\nDavid Rives MUSIC: http://www.davidrivesmusic.com\nFor the TBN show \"Creation in the 21st Century\": http://www.creationinthe21stcentury.com\n\nDavid Rives is the host of \"Creation in the 21st Century\" on TBN, singer/songwriter, and author of the book \"Wonders Without Number\".\n\nBrowse through our YouTube channel to be educated, entertained, and inspired - and don't forget to subscribe for new videos every week.", "title": "M101: The Pinwheel Galaxy- David Rives", "publishedDate": "2012-04-13T04:10:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "582XpmRENss", "description": "Video describes types of neurogenic bladder or neurogenic incontinence.The video describes the types of neurogenic incontinence.

Quiz\u00e1s ya lo conozcas si en su momento decidiste llevar a cabo la Misi\u00f3n 55 para obtener el Huevo nutritivo, aunque fuese mediante un m\u00e9todo poco \u00e9tico (que, por cierto, puedes repetir ahora). Sin embargo, un grupo que haya obtenido el nivel 5 en sus tres roles principales y posea armas bien modificadas ya est\u00e1 en condiciones de plantarle cara de forma tradicional. Y, al igual que en el combate contra el och\u00fa, ser\u00e1 de utilidad equiparse con accesorios que mejoren la resistencia frente al elemento Tierra.   Por suerte, este neoch\u00fa no viene acompa\u00f1ado por picoch\u00fas (\u00a1Por ahora!), as\u00ed que eso te ahorra tener que hacer uso de la aburrida t\u00e1ctica del protector. Dado que el \u00fanico estado alterado que puedes causarle es Deterioro (hechizo Aquiles), comienza con Arenas movedizas para que un obstructor se encargue de ello a la vez que dos inspiradores ponen las defensas propias al grupo. Prisa y Coraza son esenciales.   El ataque principal del neoch\u00fa consiste en una serie de golpes que recibe el objetivo y que no deber\u00edan suponer un problema para un personaje con una cifra de VIT cercana o superior a 15.000. Por otra parte, Bramido disipa estados beneficiosos y golpea sucesivamente a todos los personajes causando da\u00f1os bastante graves, que pueden acabar en una situaci\u00f3n peligrosa o con el fin de la partida. Si te encuentras ante el segundo caso, me temo que lo vas a tener dif\u00edcil para pasar de aqu\u00ed. Quiz\u00e1s quieras recurrir a Vanille y Necro, haciendo uso previo de Prisa y Fe y con la ayuda de un protector y de un sanador.   Volviendo al tema, en cuanto veas el aviso de Bramido, cambia a F\u00e9nix o a Lakshmi para recuperarte r\u00e1pidamente. Si lo que quieres es reducir los da\u00f1os al m\u00e1ximo, Gran muralla es la opci\u00f3n preferida (hay algunos personajes a los que se les ve muy raros como protectores, lo s\u00e9, pero es una medida salvavidas). Polen es otro ataque bastante indeseable que pone al grupo muchos estados alterados. Si dedicaste los primeros momentos del combate a lanzar beneficios, tendr\u00e1s la suerte de que algunos de los males que recibas, como AntiBravura o Freno, simplemente anulen el beneficio y no lleguen a causar efecto negativo. Sea como sea, la mejor recuperaci\u00f3n es una parada r\u00e1pida a una formaci\u00f3n compuesta por uno o dos sanadores para disipar los m\u00e1s peligrosos seguida de otra a Sinergia para restablecer los beneficios. Si tantos estados te abruman, lo mejor es que ejecutes Antimagia+ para librarte de todos de golpe por un solo PT.   No dejes de atacar al neoch\u00fa, es vital aturdirlo para superar r\u00e1pido el combate. Mant\u00e9n a un sanador con Tantalus y pasa a Ataque implacable en las situaciones estables. El enemigo puede convocar a los picoch\u00fas con Siembra. De llegar a suceder, te conviene librarte al menos de unos cuantos para no tener que reducir tus ataques ni soportar a varios enemigos que podr\u00edan poner en peligro lo que parec\u00eda un combate redondo.  \n -Recompensa: Cat\u00e1logo de caza\n -Recompensa secundaria: Semilla de dalia lunar x3", "title": "Final Fantasy XIII Misi\u00f3n 45 - Tathata escarlata - Baile jubiloso", "publishedDate": "2013-05-21T17:16:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "58KUVIn7KoE", "description": "How big is Amazon?

Search for \"Straighten Ingrown Toenails and Relieve Pain\"\n\nFortunately for me my ingrown nail is long gone, but the video just shows what product worked for me and and how easy it is to clip this thing on the nail. This clip will allow the nail to grow normally without digging into your skin.  From now on when I clip my toes, I clip them in a straight line so that the ends of your toe nails extend beyond the skin on the side of the nail.   I had an ingrown nail on my big toe and it hurt just to look at it. My nail is now re-trained to grow straight and flat and I haven't needed to use it again since. Its easy to take on and off and you can bend the metal to the curve shape you need.  \n\nI also tried a flexible carbon fiber kind of toenail brace like NailEase or CurveCorrect that you glue on top of the nail but it would not stay on.  You also might want to check into those two products because they might work for you. The metal clip rarely fell off and if it did I just found it inside my sock and put it back on after getting out of the shower.  Just use it gradually and bend it as needed to increase the spring pressure as you go.  I looked for years and tried several different solutions and it was nearly impossible to find this clip anywhere.  This metal clip was simple to use and most important of all it worked. \n\nIf your ingrown toenail situation is too severe or painful you should get it under control first by a doctor and maybe then use the clip to retrain the curvature of the nail.  In my case, the nail was dug in, inflamed and bleeding on one side only and I considered nail removal. I tried sliding a toothpick under the corner edge of the nail which provided relief but I couldn't walk around that way.  I filed off a little thickness of the top surface of the nail (where polish would go) to make it thinner which allows it to straighten more easily. If your nails are brittle or cut too short you might not have enough room to clip this on.  Using Oragel for a few days helped with temporary pain.  It's a common sense little device and it totally worked for me.\n\nYou can perform ingrown toenail treatment yourself at home like I did but if you are having pain that is getting worse and you notice more redness and pus, it's time to go see your doctor!\n\nLink to eBay: http://www.ebay.com/itm/330871590396?var=&ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649\n\nAlso see: ingrown toenail home treatment, ingrown toenail infection, ingrown toenail cure, NailEase, CurveCorrect etc.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am not a doctor or medical professional.

When Wang had exhausted his fortunes on Su, the Procuress (Hung Wie) threw him out of the brothel, and sold Su to the local magnate Shen Yen-ling (Yang Chi-ching) as concubine. But Shen's jealous wife Pi poisoned her husband and framed it on Su, who was sentenced to death.

They first formed in 1990, releasing the More Than Ever demo tape in 1991. This was quickly followed in 1992 by a split EP with Crisis of Faith and the Life Goes On EP that same year. The band was soon renowned as one of the heaviest in hardcore, drawing ire from some purists for incorporating metal riffage into their sound. Their rise in popularity paralleled that of other vegan straight edge bands such as Earth Crisis and hardline bands like Vegan Reich and Raid. While bands that adhered to Hardline were totally opposed to abortion, Chokehold was vehemently pro-choice. While Chokehold were atheists and radicals with a strongly anarchist streak to their politics, many of the hardline bands were by contrast conservative (expressing belief in a higher power, homophobia, support for the death penalty and prisons and other conservative views).\nIn 1993 Chokehold released the Prison of Hope LP through American label Conquer the World Records (CTW). They released their next record, 1994s Instilled EP, on Philadelphia, PAs Bloodlink Records. This EP featured some of their most powerful and political material to date, notably the anti-religious song Anchor, the anti-homophobia song Mindset, and Burning Bridges, with its hard-hitting lyrics: The corporations are aware where the average person is not, violence against one meat eater is not going to liberate a million animals. You must take action against those who run the industry, not the ones lied to. And to take them down we must use as much fucking violence as they do. Animal liberation, Earth liberation, Human liberation, will only come through education.\nThey followed this in the next year with their second LP, Content With Dying. This album contained by far their most controversial song yet: Not a Solution was possibly the most militantly pro-choice hardcore song since Born Againsts Mary and Child. The liner notes to the song state, to all the militant pro-lifers who couldnt spell life let alone understand it, we salute you with a middle finger. The song is directed at those who identify as pro-lifers, including many vegan straight edge bands at the time, most notably Abnegation. This song in particularly created a huge rift in the vegan straight edge scene. When Chokehold played a show with Abnegation that year, the two bands spent their sets screaming at each other, and they and their fans nearly came to blows. This refusal to back down in the face of significant opposition even within their own subculture typifies Chokeholds uncompromising stance in general.\nThey signed in 1996 to Germanys Mad Mob Records, who unbeknownst to them already had a bad reputation in the European hardcore scene. They recorded four new songs to be released as a split CD with Feeding the Fire, but after a European tour in 1996 the band decided to break up. They played their last show in March at the New Bedford Fest in Massachusetts. These four songs were released as a self-titled EP on Jawk Records the following year. Members went on to play in such bands as The Swarm, Brutal Knights, Left For Dead, Haymaker, Our War and Seventy-Eight Days.\n\n\nAlbum : Prison Of Hope LP ( 1993 )\n\nLyrics :Why cant I hold pride in my scene? - Put down for the choices I have made - Wont change my ideas just to please you - You have lost sight of what it means - i though we were in this together - Unfair judgement youve past on to me - Destroying the chance at a friendship that will never be - Too many times Ive seen it - Now its a chance I must take", "title": "Chokehold - Turn the page", "publishedDate": "2010-03-05T22:55:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "58q9bkduOM0", "description": "responding to the Bronx 2nd alarm on Ryer ave and 182nd st.\n\nLocation Bronx,NY", "title": "Fdny Thawing unit 76 and Ladder 37", "publishedDate": "2014-03-03T02:21:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "58qDZgvh3jk", "description": "The United States of Leland Movie Clip - watch all clips http://j.mp/JEdiKJ\nclick to subscribe http://j.mp/sNDUs5\n\nLeland (Ryan Gosling) describes the inherent sadness he sees in every person.\n\nTM & \u00a9 Paramount (2012)\nCast: Don Cheadle, Ryan Gosling\nDirector: Matthew Ryan Hoge\nMOVIECLIPS YouTube Channel: http://j.mp/vqieFG\nJoin our Facebook page: http://j.mp/tb8OMH\nFollow us on Twitter: http://j.mp/rZzGsm\nBuy Movie: http://j.mp/K4ccWV\nProducer: Mark Damon, Stewart Hall, Bernie Morris, Kevin Spacey, Jonah Smith, Dara Weintraub, Palmer West\nScreenwriter: Matthew Ryan Hoge\nFilm Description: Produced by Kevin Spacey, The United States of Leland is a psychological drama concerning the aftereffects of a brutal murder. It's also the first big-studio theatrical release for writer/director Matthew Ryan Hoge, whose previous work consists of the independent comedy Self Storage. Ryan Gosling plays Leland, an imprisoned teenager doing time for the stabbing murder of a disabled boy. Prison writing teacher Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle) gets caught up in the story with the intention of making a book out of it, especially when he finds out that Leland's father is the famous novelist Albert Fitzgerald (Spacey). Pearl's investigation uncovers some of the details and effects of the murder for everyone involved, including the victim's parents, Harry (Martin Donovan) and Karen Pollard (Ann Magnuson). Jena Malone plays Becky, the teenage junkie who is both Leland's ex-girlfriend and the victim's sister. The situation also complicates the relationship between Becky's older sister, Jennifer (Michelle Williams), and her sensitive boyfriend, Allen (Chris Klein). The United States of Leland premiered at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\"the united states of leland\",\"don cheadle\",\"ryan gosling\",\"matthew ryan hoge\",\"book videos\",\"independent dramas\",\"crime dramas\",drama,independent,\"mark damon\",\"kevin spacey\",\"dara weintraub\",\"jonah smith\",\"stewart hall\",\"palmer west\",\"bernie morris\",\"despair videos\",\"guilt videos\",\"weakness videos\",\"library videos\",\"prison videos\",\"leland p fitzgerald\",\"pearl madison\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++278976,/m/02p65p,/m/03m6_z", "title": "The United States of Leland (8/10) Movie CLIP - All of Their Sadness (2003) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-18T03:14:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "58qLKzZqg8w", "description": "Here's an Intamin launch coaster I just finished, onride POV coming soon.", "title": "Arbalest TPS Launch Coaster Teaser", "publishedDate": "2014-08-23T23:28:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "58qV5uEChFk", "description": "This Machine can Manufacturing up to 4 inches thickness  louver`s wood\nLength of tenon and Separation distance that`s all adjustable. \n e-mail:lihwoei@lihwoei.com.tw\nweb site: www.lihwoei.com.tw\nfax:+886-4-25289411; 25273423", "title": "LH 110 Fully auto. louver-groovers machine", "publishedDate": "2009-03-16T08:27:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "58qgIhEd29o", "description": "This track comes from Hot Record Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 beat compilation, Vol.1:  Jive Turkeys.

This mode allows you to control how much of the subject or scene is in focus. Lower f-numbers shorten the area in focus (shallow depth of field), which is great for isolating subjects against a silky smooth background. Higher f-numbers lengthen the area in focus (long depth of field), which is great for landscape photography where you want everything in focus.\n\nWritten Instructions:\n1. You can enable aperture priority mode on the Nikon D3200 by rotating the mode dial to the letter 'A'\n2. Then using the command dial (near the thumb rest), rotate it to the left to select a lower f/number and to the right to select a higher f/number\n\nQuestions: \nIf you have questions, feel free to ask me in my Nikon D3200 forum here: http://forums.cameratips.com/categories/nikon-d3200\n\nHappy Shooting!", "title": "Nikon D3200 Tips: How to Enable Aperture Priority & Set the Aperture f-number", "publishedDate": "2013-09-21T23:10:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "593YYdK5RsU", "description": "Former Home And Away stars Luke Mitchell and Rebecca Breeds reveal what they'd be doing if they weren't at the TV WEEK Logie Awards - plus, whether they'd consider returning to Summer Bay..", "title": "Cute couple alert!

Many today believe hell, judgment and holy war are \u201cskeletons in God\u2019s closet,\u201d tough topics that, if looked at closely, would reveal a cruel, vindictive tyrant rather than a good and loving God. \"How can a loving God send people to hell?\" \"Isn't it arrogant to believe Jesus is the only way to God?\" \"Why is there so much violence in the Old Testament?\" \n\n\"The Skeletons in God's Closet\" pulls these bones out into the open to exchange popular caricatures for the beauty and power of the real thing. We'll discover these topics were never really skeletons at all . . . but proclamations of a God who is good \u201cin his very bones,\u201d not just in what he does, but in who he is; not only in his actions, but in his character. We\u2019ll fling wide the closet door and sing loudly, boldly and clearly: \n\nGod is good and coming to redeem his world.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Jon Collins for creating the video.\nThanks also to Jeanette Rawlins for the concluding voiceover.\nAnd thanks again to IJM for the great work they do fighting sex trafficking and other injustices in our world.

But you weren't content with just that, you wanted to see us abuse it.\n\nSome people might call me \"soft\". I have a desk-job. I drive a Prius. Other than the goatee, on the outside I'm not what most people would call \"rugged\". While that may be what most people see, I also build stuff. I get my hands dirty. While I won't claim to be as rugged as others who do really hard work every day, I can certainly value the benefits of a good, durable smartphone that I won't have to worry about breaking. Luckily, the NEC Terrain lives up to its motto: \"Made for hard work\".\n\nThe NEC Terrain is a water-resistant, rugged device that sports a keyboard, and considering that its primary purpose is to be rugged and durable, it's a pretty nice nice phone.\n\nThe Terrain is rated IP-67 for dust and water immersion; and Military 810G for shock, extreme temperatures, and salt fog; yet it still manages to cram a push-to-talk button and QWERTY keyboard inside its rugged shell.\n\nOn the inside, the NEC Terrain is a little on the light side. Although is has a dual-core 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 8960 processor, it only has 1GB RAM and a 3.1-inch, 640x480 screen, this smartphone isn't going to win any performance contests. It's running Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, which seemed a little out of place to us, but overall the device is pretty snappy, and we didn't notice any hanging or lagging -- except when it took us two or three times to tap a somewhat small on-screen button.\n\nIf your job has you in \"the field\" more than in an office, and you want a phone that's a little more durable than the relatively fragile flagship devices from the major OEMs, the NEC Terrain is a great mix of performance, specs, and durability.\n\nSubscribe:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=Pocketnowvideo\n\nAbout us:\nPocketnowVideo is the official YouTube channel of Pocketnow.com.
