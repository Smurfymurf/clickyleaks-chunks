When I was in fifth grade, I actually remember being really excited because sixth grade was the year we got lockers. So I spent all this time making sure all of my pictures looked good and adding fun things so that it looked absolutely how I wanted it to look.\n\nHere's how to keep yours neat, organized, and looking awesome. Start by keeping everything in order. That means getting a locker shelf and a magnetic pencil holder. That way all your books have a place to go, and you're never unprepared for class. Then add pictures of your friends or of your favorite celebrity crushes.\n\nNext, to stay extra on top of your game, hang up your schedule. It might not be the coolest looking thing in your locker, so color code your classes or add some stickers, anything to make it yours and make it something that you want to open your locker and see. Don't be afraid to get creative with it. If you're a sports fan, add baseball cards or theme your locker with the colors of your favorite team.

He was an active and honest propagator of WAHDAT-E-UMMAT (Unity of Muslim Ummah) and for this cause he struggled in his life till the end. It is his one of the another contribution that he always preached the true essence of Islam, free from any type of negative constraints or influence E.g. schism, exhibition of knowledge, pride or for worldly gain etc. His knowledge was so vast and his memory was remarkable that he used to appreciate the contribution of Ulama (scholars) without any discrimination whether they are Brailvi, Deobandi or Ahle Hadees or whoever else. Maulana Ishaq is equally popular among the youth and the old ones. He is liked among Religious or Liberal class through his teachings/lectures to seek guidance from it. \n\n\nMaulana Mufti Ishaq rahmatullah ailah never associated him to any group (Maslak) instead he always called himself a Muslim and his all lectures are purely related to the original primitive teaching of Islam. He always addressed the issues of the questioners and provided them with best solution.

Reidy, Rick Schwartz, Colin Vaines, Bob Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein, Rick Yorn\nScreenwriter: Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, Kenneth Lonergan\nFilm Description: The violent rise of gangland power in New York City at a time of massive political corruption and the city's evolution into a cultural melting pot set the stage for this lavish historical epic, which director Martin Scorsese finally brought to the screen almost 30 years after he first began to plan the project. In 1846, as waves of Irish immigrants poured into the New York neighborhood of Five Points, a number of citizens of British and Dutch heritage who were born in the United States began making an open display of their resentment toward the new arrivals. William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), better known as \"Bill the Butcher\" for his deadly skill with a knife, bands his fellow \"Native Americans\" into a gang to take on the Irish immigrants; the immigrants in turn form a gang of their own, \"The Dead Rabbits,\" organized by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson). After an especially bloody clash between the Natives and the Rabbits leaves Vallon dead, his son goes missing; the boy ends up in a brutal reform school before returning to the Five Points in 1862 as Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio). Now a strapping adult who has learned how to fight, Amsterdam has come to seek vengeance against Bill the Butcher, whose underworld control of the Five Points through violence and intimidation dovetails with the open corruption of New York politician \"Boss\" Tweed (Jim Broadbent). Amsterdam gradually penetrates Bill the Butcher's inner circle, and he soon becomes his trusted assistant. Amsterdam also finds himself falling for Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a beautiful but street-smart thief who was once involved with Bill. Amsterdam is learning a great deal from Bill, but before he can turn the tables on the man who killed his father, Amsterdam's true identity is exposed, even though he has concealed it from nearly everyone, including Jenny. Gangs Of New York was the first film in two years from actor Leonardo DiCaprio; ironically, it was at one time scheduled to open on the same day as Catch Me if You Can, the Steven Spielberg project that DiCaprio began filming immediately after Gangs wrapped.\n\n\"gangs of new york\",\"gangs of new york clip\",\"gangs of new york trailer\",\"gangs of new york part 1\",\"liam neeson\",\"john c reilly\",\"daniel day-lewis\",\"brendan gleeson\",\"gary lewis\",\"liam carney\",\"gary mccormack\",\"david mcblain\",\"martin scorsese\",\"club videos\",\"coat videos\",\"cross videos\",\"hat videos\",\"knife videos\",\"weapons videos\",\"crime dramas\",drama,epics,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++257288,/m/016yvw,/m/02qgyv,/m/0h5g_,/m/053xw6,/m/0262dt5,/m/0gbxz46,/m/03cgwmb,/m/0b_vbhk", "title": "Gangs of New York (2/12) Movie CLIP -

Und auch, weil der Schaffensprozess zu einem Ende gekommen ist, sind die Skulpturen f\u00fcr den K\u00fcnstler vollkommen. S\u00e4ge und Holz erfordern ein \u00e4u\u00dferst diszipliniertes Vorgehen, Sehen ist dabei wichtiger als Schneiden und Abtragen. \u00c4hnlich wie ein Gletscher die Landschaft formt, wird das Holz von einem brutalen, alles zerfetzenden Werkzeug geformt - im Zeitraffer und mit Hilfe von Technik. Im Kontrast dazu ist ein h\u00e4ufiges und langes Innehalten und ein zartes, ersp\u00fcrendes Abtragen notwendig, will der K\u00fcnstler nicht tagelange Arbeit zerst\u00f6ren. Immer ist es entscheidend, den Punkt zu finden, an dem der Prozess kulminiert, an dem man aufh\u00f6ren muss, an dem nichts mehr hinzuzuf\u00fcgen bzw. mit dem Werkzeug wegzunehmen ist. Die k\u00fcnstlerische Aussage hat jetzt etwas Endg\u00fcltiges gewonnen. \nMehr Informationen unter:\nwww.bernhard-schwanitz.eu\nhttp://www.facebook.com/AtelierBernhardSchwanitz \nhttp://www.leinwandundbronze.de/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=35\n\n\nenglish:\n\nThe artist Bernhard Schwanitz excavates layers on his wooden sculptures and at the same time attitudes and internal conditions, wich are very often hidden in our calibrated every day life: Dispair, effort, stress, passionate rear up or applayence of great fortitude against an invisible something. Some of the sculptures burry an opressed suffer in their dislocation, others are an approach to a more static, classical, reposing form of sculpture. In any stance the sculptures adopt an attitude of aesthetics, autonomie and dignity.\nContemplating the outer skin of the sculptures, will bring rough, abrasive and impenetrable areas to one eyes, other areas unbossom a touching erotic of a hesitating premature and vulnerable divulgment. As a hole the skulptures never loose their stunning impression and with an increasing distance they more and more uncover surprisingly the magic and gracefulness of this fragmentary creatures. \nIn the shadows the sculptures apply to the wall they are again present, but in a two dimensional way -- with tranquilized forces and their abrasiveness subdued.\n\n\nsee more at:\nwww.bernhard-schwanitz.eu\nhttp://www.facebook.com/AtelierBernhardSchwanitz \nhttp://www.leinwandundbronze.de/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=35", "title": "Bernhard Schwanitz Torsi 2012 Skulpturen aus Holz /wooden sculpture", "publishedDate": "2012-07-10T13:28:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "ADrQs45bubo", "description": "Renovating a 21 year old trailer -- Kenny started out with a couple kicks.

Mit oft nur einer Behandlung erhalten Sie bemerkenswerte Ergebnisse und den Vorteil einer schnellen Genesung. \n\n- Falten\n- Hautbildverj\u00fcngung\n- Beseitigung von Aknenarben\n- Hautporen- und Hautbildverfeinerung\n- Altersflecken/Sonnenflecken\n- Hautflecken ( h\u00e4ufig verursacht durch die Pille ) \n- Entfernung von T\u00e4towierungen\n- Schwangerschaftstreifen / Dehnungsstreifen\n- Dekollete\u00b4- Falten\n\nWie funktioniert der Co2 Fractional Laser?Es werden winzige L\u00f6cher in die Hautoberfl\u00e4che gelasert, wobei jeder behandelte Hautpunkt von ungelaserten Hautstellen umgeben ist. Dies f\u00f6rdert einen schnellen Heilungsprozess. Die obere Hautschicht wird punktuell abgetragen, die Tiefenwirkung des Lasers erw\u00e4rmt die untere Hautschicht und es kommt zu einer Stimulation des Bindegewebes sowie einem Zusammenziehen der kollagenen Fasern. Die Bildung von frischem Kollagen wird stimuliert, Falten werden reduziert, die Haut wird straffer, glatter, feiner und st\u00f6rende Pigmentierungen oder sonstige Makel verschwinden.\n \nWie lange dauert eine Behandlung mit dem Fractional CO2 Laser ?Je nach Intensit\u00e4t dauert die Behandlung f\u00fcr das ganze Gesicht lediglich 20 Minuten und wird deswegen in den USA auch Lunch-Time-Laser genannt. Der Kunde sp\u00fcrt keine Schmerzen, allenfalls ein leichtes Brennen, das zudem durch aktive K\u00fchlung gemindert wird.      In der Regel sind drei bis vier Einzelbehandlungen notwendig, allerdings ist bereits nach der 1. Behandlung ein sofortiges  Straffungsergebnis sichtbar.\n\nWas ist der Unterschied zu anderen \"verj\u00fcngenden\" Lasersystemen?\nDas Verfahren ist minimal - invasiv. Das bedeutet hier, dass die Hautoberfl\u00e4che nur geringf\u00fcgig (nicht fl\u00e4chig) gesch\u00e4digt wird. Durch die sorgf\u00e4ltige Auswahl der Hautpartien ist eine ma\u00dfgeschneiderte Therapie m\u00f6glich. Nach einer Behandlung ist der Patient sofort wieder gesellschaftsf\u00e4hig,(keine Ausfallzeit). Bei anderen Methoden sind Spuren der Behandlung \u00fcber Tage bis Wochen deutlich sichtbar.\n\nIhre Vorteile auf einen Blick:\n- sofortige Hautstraffung\n- vielseitig und nahezu schmerzfrei\n- nat\u00fcrliches Ergebnis\n- ohne l\u00e4stige Ausfallzeiten\n- sehr schonende und vertr\u00e4gliche Methode\n- sehr gut auch an empfindlichen Regionen (z.B. Dekollet\u00e9) einsetzbar \n\nKann man danach unter Leute?Nach der Behandlung sind die Mikropunkte mit blo\u00dfem Auge nicht sichtbar. Die Haut ist lediglich leicht ger\u00f6tet und eine leichte Schwellung kann auftreten. In  Einzelf\u00e4llen bilden sich kleine Minikrusten, die sich nach drei Tagen wieder l\u00f6sen. Bereits nach ca. f\u00fcnf bis sieben Tagen ist der Abheilungsprozess abgeschlossen. Bereits nach einer Sitzung ist ein deutliches Straffungsergebnis sichtbar, das Endresultat erreicht aufgrund der zunehmenden Kollagen-Neubildung erst nach mehreren Wochen seinen H\u00f6hepunkt.\n\nGibt es Risiken und Nebenwirkungen?Im Normalfall entstehen keine Nebenwirkungen und man ist sofort wieder gesellschaftsf\u00e4hig. Die R\u00f6tung ist in den meisten F\u00e4llen bereits am n\u00e4chsten Tag nach der Behandlung verschwunden. ( Vergleichbar mit einem leichten Sonnenbrand )  Die Vertr\u00e4glichkeit der Behandlung mit dem CO2  ist individuell verschieden und wird vorab bei einem ausf\u00fchrlichen Beratungsgespr\u00e4ch besprochen.\nSprechen  Sie uns an.

We strongly recommend using Dynastart or Superstart nutrient \nIts specific preparation of yeast origin, naturally rich in vitamins, minerals, fatty acids and sterols will significantly improve the yeast\u2019s viability, its resistance to ethanol and the aroma production as well as avoid excessive production of VA and reductive character.\n\nThe yeasts, about 95% dry, will effectively intake the sterols and the micro-elements and integrate them into its membrane; this will ensure a healthy and strong membrane even for the last generation of cell multiplication. \n\nThe recommended dosage for Dynastart  and Superstart is 1.5 times the yeast dosage or 30 g/hL (or 300ppm) to the whole tank volume; Do not use opened bags.\n\nMake sure you use a big enough container to leave room for the preparation to expand and to add juice later on.\nIn a clean and inert container, dissolve your total quantity of Dynastart/Superstart needed in 20 times its weight in well or tap water at 40\u00b0C or 104\u00b0F and mix well. \n\nThe next step is adding the active dry yeast. Once Dynastart/Superstart is well incorporated you can add the yeast in the rehydration water. No must or sugar is necessary at this stage, and no ammonium based nutrient should be added as it would be toxic to the yeasts. If you are not using a rehydration nutrient, use 10 times the yeasts weight in water, at a temperature of 37C or 99F. The recommended dosage of ADY is 20 to 30 g/hL, 200 to 300 ppm. Stir gently but well and let the preparation rest for 20 minutes at cellar temperature. Depending on the yeast strain, you may or may not see activity or foaming, but the preparation should look like a homogenous cream after 20 minutes.\n\nNow that the yeasts are rehydrated, the next step has two main goals: provide sugar to the yeasts for their metabolism that is just starting to be active again and adjust the temperature closer to the tank temperature and avoid a cold shock. It is indeed very important to avoid temperature differences exceeding 10C or 20F between the 2.\nDouble the volume of your yeast inoculums with must or juice and let it stand for 10 minutes. Make sure you check the yeast preparation temperature again and repeat the step if the temperature is more than 10C/20F higher than the tank. Once the temperatures are close enough, you are ready to incorporate the yeast inoculums to the bottom of the tank. A pump over to homogenize is recommended.\n\nThe total preparation time of the yeast inoculum must not exceed 45 minutes!\n\nwww.laffort.com", "title": "LAFFORT - YEAST REHYDRATION PROTOCOL VIDEO - ENGLISH", "publishedDate": "2014-09-24T14:37:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "ADzy-_vn8GM", "description": "", "title": "alimentando sargos. e safias. em ibiza", "publishedDate": "2013-10-19T00:06:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "AE-ACvhgvKU", "description": "What people really think about healthcare, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, Barack Obama, the Democratic Party, Liberals, Liberalism, redistribution of wealth, Socialism, the loss of personal liberty, the loss of freedom, Communism, Centralism, Authoritarian government, Hugo Chavez, Brad Pitt, Che Gavara, Cuba, and Leftists everywhere who harbor nothing but hate in their shriveled dark little hearts.", "title": "healthcare.wmv", "publishedDate": "2010-03-23T18:41:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "AE-UgIWG7FU", "description": "Elsa & Kraex wurden in den Europapark nach Rust eingeladen und haben die neuen Attraktionen im M\u00e4rchenwald angesehen.", "title": "KriKraKRAEX-Grimms M\u00e4rchen im Europapark", "publishedDate": "2013-06-04T11:06:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "AE-XeZ3R98U", "description": "All you need is a hand.\n\nLike BuzzFeedVideo on Facebook: \n\nMusic:\nCity Sunrise\nWarner // Chappell Production Music\n\nGET MORE BUZZFEED:\nwww.buzzfeed.com\nwww.buzzfeed.com/video\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeed\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedvideo\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedyellow\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedpop\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedblue\nwww.youtube.com/cnnbuzzfeed\n\nBUZZFEED BLUE\nTasty short, fun, inspiring, funny, interesting videos from BuzzFeed.

They claim to have recaptured two northern Iraqi towns from ISIS fighters. The Obama administration said the militants \u2014 about 30 miles from Erbil \u2014 have heavy tanks and artillery. State Department officials confirmed that the U.S. is speeding up shipments of weapons to help the Kurdish fighters.\nWith President Obama on vacationing on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Vice President Joe Biden told the new Iraqi president that the U.S. fully supports his decision to form a new and inclusive government.", "title": "American ISIS sympathizer arrested at JFK in New York", "publishedDate": "2014-08-12T01:37:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "AE2AfygrQdI", "description": "Ethnic music from Zimbabwe.", "title": "Shona Ancestral Spirit Song Nyama Musango (Zimbabwe)", "publishedDate": "2009-11-22T10:33:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "AE32TqnnibI", "description": "Www.Seedsavers.Net", "title": "Pandanus pandan culture", "publishedDate": "2012-08-19T06:21:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "AE3IkmL1nRo", "description": "Since I couldn't find a copy of this recording on Youtube, I decided to upload it myself.

Jerzy Artur Kostecki), Tango from the year 1927, performed by an uncredited Polish Choir from the USA, in 1950s/60s (?) \n\nNOTE: In Polish memory, Polesie  - the eastern region of Poland before 1939, located in Volhynia and being a meeting point of four cultures: Polish, Lithuanian, Belorussian and Ukrainian  - will remain a lost-forever mysterious country of swamps, marshes, wild forrests and silent people, who led their fishermen's lives in simple wooden villages or in flat bottom swamp boats, in the area near the sources of river Prype\u0107 (in Byelorussian: Prypyat' - a tributary of the River Dnieper, which it joins 80 km above Kiev). \n\nPrype\u0107 was navigable for most of its length, and canals built in the XIX/XXth c. by Polish water engineers (e.g. Ogi\u0144ski canal) linked it to the Bug, Vistula, and Niemen (Nemunas) rivers, creating a unique inland river-communication system between Baltic ports and the Black Sea. Therefore, during the Second World War that area and its capital in Pi\u0144sk, had special strategic importance. \n\nIn September 1939, as soon as Soviet Army invaded Poland, a well-developed pre-war Polish River Fleet with its River Port of Pi\u0144sk and all the professional inland-sailors crew, was annihilated. All inhabitants of Polesie, who declared themselves being Polish, were executed by NKVD, deported into the Archipelago Gulag in USSR or, if by miracle someone  happened to survive all this, murdered by the Ukrainian Nationalist Army, who in this area, between 1939-45, carried on its ethnic cleansing actions against Poles.  \nAs result, Polesie (now in Belarus and northern Ukraine) is a rather neglected, in large part meliorated area. Pinsk - overloaded with pseudo-modern Soviet architecture has completely lost its lively character of the provincial Polish town full of fishermen's or Jewish commercial life and  wonderful baroque architecture, dominating its panorama. The spell of a rich multi-national culture of one of the most unique and fascinating regions of Europe before 1939 has vanished, while in some pockets still exists the marshes' wildlife, willingly visited by the conoisseurs of silence and loneliness from the West of Europe. \n\nSee prewar Polish documentary movie from so-called Water Merket in the regional capital town of Pi\u0144sk http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHs5Pg-Qopo\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAfter 1945, during the comminist regime in Poland, this tango  with its lovely poetical text, calling back the nostalgic beauty of prewar Polish territory, which was annexed and destroyed by Soviet Russia - could be listened to only on rare opportunities from someones old record or played on the piano, from some old music sheets. I copied this recording from a tape with the radio concert I registered in the the late 1980s - just before the collapse of communism, when radio censorship was becoming weaker. But name of this excellent choir remains a mystery for me. From the speakers comment I remember something he mentioned about a Polish choir from Chicago, or a sort. I dont doubt, YT friends will not fail and, as usually,  will help us identify this recording!  By the way: please, forget this could possibly be  Ch\u00f3r Dana, as I read in someones site in the web. This is NOT Ch\u00f3r Dana!! , neither it is any of prewar Polish revellers groups! The recording is obviously postawar and its perfectly-styled prewar singing manner carries a light trace of a pastiche and definetely, comes from later years.", "title": "Polesia czar (The Spell Of Polesie) - Polish tango, 1927", "publishedDate": "2010-01-17T18:06:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "AEAAKB8Z5P0", "description": "Found a vacant lot to catch speed.", "title": "Long-boarding Down Slope", "publishedDate": "2013-04-05T06:20:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "AEADD-CkxEg", "description": "thanks to songbird1025 (puppyloove25@aim.com) for her voice!\n\nThis is a fan made animation \nSaint seiya Omega is property of TOEI Animation\nmusic taken from Saint seiya Omega  of TOEI Animation", "title": "Saint Seiya Omega (\u03a9) - ANDROMEDA CLOTH", "publishedDate": "2012-07-11T10:09:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "AEAYG82Qrow", "description": "I don't own audio, so lately my family and I have been going through a hard time since sunday night when we discovered that Comander (my little sister's horse) had a very high fever and wouldn't eat, we took him to Purdue University and we discovered that he had anaplasmosis ( a tick borne disease) his small intestine was swollen and other problems, he's 24 year old so he couldn't go through surgery so we were all dreading and expecting that he would be deceased by the first two days but today things took a turn and they're letting us take him home this weekend!

He was sneezing but now he's not... does that mean its all ok?\n\nA: Unfortunately no. Foxtails (or grass seeds) are notorious for only irritating the nose intermittently. It is very common for dogs to sneeze like crazy at first and then stop, even for an entire day, and then start up again. The sneezing can only happen after the dog gets up from sleeping or sometimes when they get active or excited. Sometimes the sneezing just comes and goes for no apparent reason. The reason the sneezing isn't constant is two-fold; firstly, they just get used to it in there and aren't as bothered after a while and secondly, the foxtail becomes coated in mucous and is therefore less irritating in the nasal passage.\n\nThe good news is that here at The Country Vet, there are not many foxtails that we are not able to retrieve thanks to our Rigid Rhinoscope. This device, which is usually only used by specialists on a referral basis, can be used if normal means to remove the foxtail do not work. It is a wonderful piece of equipment that we can use which can save your dog a second anesthesia and a lot of expense by not having to be referred out elsewhere. If you suspect your pet has a foxtail, either in their nose, ear or paw, give us a call right away.", "title": "FAQ 5 My dog inhaled a foxtail into his nose?", "publishedDate": "2013-08-07T15:08:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "AEGafSFVX80", "description": "Oddly acting cowfish", "title": "Cowfish wierdness", "publishedDate": "2010-07-13T00:26:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "AEGn0UAnuO0", "description": "Fourth in a series of short videos brought to you by the Maryland Coalition for Ethical Research.

The word Upanishad means secret and sacred knowledge. Isavasya Upanishad is a portion from the Sukla Yajurveda samhita containing twenty mantras.  The central theme of this Upanishad \"Isavasyam idam stream\" is to teach that God is all pervasive and regulator of all.  All are entirely dependent upon him.  It advises elimination of greed for spiritual pursuit; Performance of one's prescribed duties in dedication to the God.  To know the God as described above is right knowledge.  The following prayer has rich spiritual content and a high degree of poetic appeal. Ohm, God lead us by the right path towards the prosperity (liberation), remove the bondage.  We offer profuse salutations.\n\nBrhadaranyaka Upanishad is the most important of the Upanishads.  It details the theory of creation and the means of knowing the self and the Brahman three sections.  Madhu Kanda,\nYajnavalkya Kanda and Khila Kanda. The Madhu Kanda teaches about the identity of the individual self and the universal self the superimposition of the world on Brahman.\n\n1.

and experiences of holding onto something in the present or the past.

It has also featured as Radio 1's 'Track of the Day' and 1Xtra Breakfast's 'Best of British' (record of the week).

He stole the show at Notting Hill Carnival when he joined Toddla T Sound. He has also toured extensively across mainland Europe and performed with Major Lazer on their recent tour.\n\"Move Back\" is scheduled for release on March 2nd 2014.

He traveled thousands of miles from his home in Munich, Germany, to the Far East of Russia, to picture the Shiveluch and Kliuchevskoi volcanoes. At Shiveluch, he plotted up just 3.5 miles away in an area previously decimated by an earlier eruption. While picturing Klichevskoi, the closest he could safely get was 12.5 miles away.\n\nVideographer / Director: Richard Roscoe\nProducer: James Tegerdine\nEditor: Joshua Douglas / Ian Phillips\n\nFor more amazing footage of the amazing side of life, visit the Barcroft Media website: http://bit.ly/19OYwp\nLike Barcroft Media on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/RJlaj6\nFollow Barcroft Media on Twitter: http://bit.ly/10vFLY9", "title": "Stunning Time Lapse Of Powerful Volcanic Eruption In Russia", "publishedDate": "2013-10-29T12:46:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "AEjE6J-0DDs", "description": "Hypnotherapy In Adelaide\nAustralian Hypnotherapy\nhttp://www.australianhypnotherapy.com/#\nAdelaide\n207 O'connell Street, North Adelaide, SA 5006\nClive Westwood & Zakary Chan\nphone- 0413413918\nOr 0401735248\naustralianhypnotherapy@gmail.com", "title": "Hypnotherapy In Adelaide Helps samhainophobia   Halloween", "publishedDate": "2013-06-03T17:08:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "AEjF-MzzqaE", "description": "Charles French of Total Image Menswear,LLC\nFollow me on Twitter @charlesfrench\nFind me on Facebook: www.facebook.com/totalimage2\n**If you tied your bowtie using this video, upload a pic to my facebook page!!**", "title": "How to tie a bow tie", "publishedDate": "2010-08-09T17:43:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "AEjMSbrFz7Y", "description": "http://ozoutback.com.au/\nA boy, painted up for his \"Djapi\" initiation ceremony sits between men who sing, play clapsticks and didjeridu while young men and women dance on the sandy ground in Numbulwar, in eastern Arnhem Land, Northern Territory.\nFor photos of Aboriginal Initiation Ceremonies from Northern Australia please visit http://ozoutback.com.au/Australia/abinitna/index.html.\n\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=AEjMSbrFz7Y", "title": "Dance during Aboriginal Initiation Ceremony, northern Australia (1)", "publishedDate": "2010-04-18T09:24:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "AEjr9WchNkg", "description": "In tapes that just surfaced, Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, says Americans were duped regarding Obamacare.", "title": "Obamacare architect calls average voter 'stupid'", "publishedDate": "2014-11-12T22:04:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "AEk_KDSW7MU", "description": "I hacked the hell out of my head with a shitty Astra blade, new out of the wrapper.

The early belief was that the infection was due to a worm, which it is not. It is a result of a fungus infection. Nevertheless, the name \"ringworm\" has stuck. Some of these fungi produce round spots, but many do not. On the other hand, many round spots are not from fungus. A physical examination of the affected skin, evaluation of skin scrapings under the microscope, and culture tests can help doctors make the appropriate distinctions. A proper diagnosis is essential to successful treatment.\n\nThe medical term for ringworm is \"tinea.\" (Tinea gets us back to worms. Tinea is the Latin name for a growing worm.) Doctors add another word to indicate where the fungus is located. Tinea capitis, for instance, refers to scalp ringworm, tinea corporis to fungus of the body, tinea pedis to fungus of the feet, and so on.\n\n\nWhat causes ringworm?\n\n\nAlthough the world is full of yeasts, molds, and fungi, only a few cause skin problems. These agents are called the dermatophytes, which means \"skin fungi.\" Skin fungi can only live on the dead layer of keratin protein on top of the skin. They rarely invade deeper into the body and cannot live on mucous membranes, such as those in the mouth or vagina.\n\n\nWhat are the sources of skin fungi?\n\n\nSome fungi live only on human skin, hair, or nails. Others live on animals and only visit humans sometimes. Still others live in the soil. It is often difficult or impossible to identify the source of a particular person's skin fungus.\n\nHeat and moisture help fungi grow and thrive, which makes them more common in skin folds such as those in the groin or between the toes. This also accounts for their reputation as being caught from showers, locker rooms, and swimming pools. This reputation is exaggerated, though, since many people with \"jock itch\" or \"athlete's foot\" are neither jocks nor athletes.", "title": "Ringworm NYC - (212) 644-6454 - NYC Ringworm - New York, NY", "publishedDate": "2010-06-30T14:01:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "AEsCz6rcWPU", "description": "Squidy is a good role model.

Ik zit in ieder geval niet te wachten op huilerige rappers, dus zocht ik samen met A.R.T. naar een vorm waarin ik wel mijn verhaal kwijt kon. 'Naaktslak' is het gevolg hiervan; een uplifting riddim met een luchtige toon. Hierna ontstonden in vrij korte tijd nog drie liedjes in die richting en wisten we zeker dat we hier een album van moesten maken.\"\n\nToen Doe Maar voorman Henny Vrienten van het project hoorde, kon hij het niet laten zijn bijdrage te leveren. \"Ik had de demo's gehoord en ik dacht: 'Jezus, wat een lekkere reggae, dat wil ik ook.' Ik wilde gelijk meedoen en heb geen moment getwijfeld. Dit soort muziek wordt niet gemaakt in Nederland en Rico's stem en teksten zijn prachtig.\"\n\nVrienten: \"Ik hou heel veel van hoe Rico zijn eigen ervaringen, die niet altijd positief zijn, weet om te zetten in een positief liedje. Vooral in combinatie met de slimmigheden die voorbij komen. Ik herken ook veel van hem in mijn eigen werk, als het neerkomt op serieuze dingen op een grappige wijze te vertellen.\" Wat begon als een eervol aandeel met enkele typische baslijnen van een paar losse liedjes, werd groter en groter. Inmiddels heeft Henny bijgedragen aan de arrangementen en koortjes op acht van de veertien tracks.\n\nDe albumtitel 'Irie' heeft een dubbele betekenis. Allereerst is het een verbastering van de artiestennaam 'Rico'. \"Dat werd onder vrienden al snel 'Ri' en A.R.T. maakte daar jaren terug al 'Irie' van. Toen ik met deze reggaemuziek bezig was, ben ik gaan graven naar de betekenis van het woord. Het is Jamaicaans voor volkomen vrede hebben met jezelf en je zijn. Een groter contrast was er destijds niet mogelijk met hoe ik me voelde. Ik vond dat fascinerend. Tegelijk geloof ik dat je terug krijgt wat je geeft. Als ik die rust en positiviteit uitstraal, hoop ik het ook terug te krijgen.\"\n\nNaast de gastbijdragen van Henny Vrienten op 'Irie' doen Sticks, Maikal X (Postmen), Typhoon, Pieter Both (Beef, Jah6) en de Zwolse vocalist Bert Vrieling mee op de plaat. Velen zullen aanwezig zijn bij de feestelijke album-presentatie op 19 april in Hedon, Zwolle. \n\nDiezelfde dag (19 april) is het ook internationale Record Store Day. Ook Rico & A.R.T. doen dit jaar mee en wel met een exclusieve 7\" vinyluitgave van single 'Naaktslak', met B-kant 'Ooit'. Daarnaast staat een tour langs diverse speciaalzaken gepland. Hierover later meer. \n\nTRACKLIST IRIE\n1. Intro Irie\n2. Naaktslak\n3. Ooit\n4. Omega (met Henny Vrienten)\n5. Mea Culpa\n6. Niet Zeuren\n7. Kalm (met Pieter Both)\n8. Opa (met Bert Vrieling)\n9.

God has reprimanded, in a sense, Jonah, and we are asking the question how will Jonah respond. Will he get even angrier? Or will he repent from his petulance and from his anger and turn to God and humble himself? How will it end? How will Jonah respond? The answer, nobody really knows.\n\nBut I think that's the point that it is so open ended at the conclusion of the book of Jonah, because it's really not about Jonah. This book is written for you and for me, it's written for us. Whilst we may not know the answer for Jonah, we can answer for ourselves. Are we today more concerned about our prejudices, our wants, our desires, or are we concerned about others, for theirs souls and concerned for God's will to be done? \n\nWe need not look at others we must look at ourselves. And this I think is the way to read the Scriptures. The Bible is written not so much to tell me about somebody else, but it is to teach me and to show me the will of God. \n\nSo would you today remain in your anger, petulance or would you turn to God? That's the point of the question at the end of the book of Jonah. And I pray that as you come to the Bible, you would have this self-searching spirit and attitude. \n\nLord, speak into my life. Because the Bible is written for you hat you may be closer to God. May you be able to apply it in your life in a very personal way, God bless.\n\nhttp://www.pastorjasonlim.org\nhttp://www.glcc-online.org\nhttp://www.twitter.com/pastorjasonlim\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pastorjasonlim", "title": "The Bible is for You", "publishedDate": "2012-03-13T08:04:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "AF60p7met8Y", "description": "Letter-winged Kite (Elanus scriptus).\nBowenville, SE Queensland, Australia\n\nVideo credit: Aviceda\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nDownload: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Letter-winged_Kite_bowenville.ogg?uselang=en-gb\nPlease see the \"About\" section on the channel page for details of how to use this video.

Visit us at http://surroundsoundspeakerplacement.net\n\nWhen planning a home theater system the position of your speakers can make a big difference in your listening experience.\nThe center channel plays a very important role in your surround sound system. The center channel provides the dialogue so placement should be above or below the center of your television. The ideal height of the center channel speaker would be the same height as your front speakers' tweeters or as close as possible. Also your center channel speaker should be the same distance as your front left and right speakers are when seated. Visit us at http://surroundsoundspeakerplacement.net\n\nSpeakers need to work together to create the surround sound experience of a home theater experience. Make sure your speakers are matched.This will give you the best sound. Voice matching is key to an effective home theater experience. Choosing speakers from the same series of speakers generally provides the best sound experience. The following speakers provide the best home theater experience.\n\nFront left and right speakers\nCenter channel speaker\nSurround speakers\nSubwoofer\n\nFront speakers not only serve to handle the movie's soundtrack they also provide the sound for stereo music. This makes their position an important factor when placing them in your room. The front left and right speakers should be placed so the tweeters are aimed at your ear level when seated. Visit us at http://surroundsoundspeakerplacement.net\n\nSurround sound speaker placement should be placed to the left and right of your seated position if possible. Since every room is different you will need to experiment with placement of the speakers to determine what works best for your situation. Ideally they should be placed above ear level, a good rule is to place them at ear level when standing.\n\nA subwoofer provides the lows needed to truly experience home theater. Plan on including a powered subwoofer. Most soundtracks provide a dedicated channel for deep bass. This is what makes the soundtrack sound more lifelike. Special effects like explosions give you the feeling of actually being there. A subwoofer also adds to the music experience since most speakers don't provide that level of bass that a subwoofer can.

She is office appropriate and also date night approved! I love how this shoe plays with the crisp off-white woven body against the racy cheetah print platform. It's a brilliant mix of naughty but nice!\n\nThe heel looks like dark stacked wood and there is a decorative faux wood bead at the toe area. The metal accent pieces are polished gold and add just a touch more of class to this already well presented shoe.\n\nThe quality is fantastic from ShoeDazzle and the price is even better- $35.95 with Vip Membership. I found the shoe to fit true-to-size. The heel height is over 5\" yet with the platform and snugness from the slingback, I thought this shoe was fairly easy to walk in. The open toe isn't too roomy and the strap area isn't too tight. I found this shoe to fit my foot just perfectly!\n\nKrissy is the high heel I will be wearing when I need to \"put my best foot forward\" at a business meeting. She's confident and classy. She is also my pick for when I need to spice up a plain black dress.

Myself in a specific or unique fashion is I went to medical school, went to residency, United States Navy actually paid for medical school for me, so I went and I did general OB-GYN for four years before making the decision to go back and do GYN oncology.  For me individually it was a decision to go back in fellowship, which honestly was not a very easy one.  Had three kids at that time, was getting a little bit older in age, and getting kind of settled down and after two to three years of working as a general OB-GYN, I really missed two important things that inspired me to go back and do the extra training.  For me it came down to two things, I really missed taking care of people that needed me or were over sick and I know that sounds strange, but my personality individually I enjoy taking care of people that really needed my help and in general OB-GYN I felt like I missed a little bit of that.  I really helped taking care of the people that really needed my expertise and look to the medical profession to really help them get out of the dire situation, so I missed that and I get that from GYN oncology.  Secondly, I very much enjoyed surgery.  That was the most enjoyable part of my job when I did OB-GYN but I just did not feel like I got enough of that and like everyone in life, we have strengths and we all have weaknesses and we have desires and we have dislikes and for me things that I really enjoy were doing a lot of surgery and taking care of people that really needed me and for me it was an natural move to GYN oncology.  It was not easy going back to school and working longer for less money for three years, but it is one that I have been very very happy I made. In fact my wife helped me make it because it was those years of doing general OB-GYN became hard for me.  It was something that I really just was passionate about and so after going back to doing fellowship, certainly I found a role or a profession that I am very passionate about and enjoy everyday.\n\nLearn more about Dr. McDonald: http://presbyteriangyncancer.org/?id=5013&sid=123", "title": "What Inspired You to Become a Gynecological Oncologist?", "publishedDate": "2012-11-07T18:17:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "AFW06G049QM", "description": "Element, an amazing product that BOR has occurred.

It is getting easier to know approximate times per moon locations in the sky.  Also, with the positions of the moon as the earth rotates are like numbers on a clock if you guage it by the one circle that is at 12 during a full moon.  Lastly, there is the illusion of the moon moving(which it does 5%) as hands do on a clock(constant motion).

Most of the adherents of this religion today live in the Indian state of Assam. As part of the greater Bhakti movement in other parts of India, it rejects vedic and other esoteric rites of worship, and instead replaces them by a simplified form that requires just uttering the name (naam) of God.\n\nThe religion is also called Mahapuruxiya because it is based on the worship of the Mahapurux or Mahapurush (Sanskrit: Maha: Supreme and purush: Being), an epithet of Lord Vishnu in the Bhagavata and its adherents are often called Mahapuruxia, Sankari, Saraniya etc. In course of time, the epithet 'Mahapurux' came to be (secondarily) applied also to Sankardeva and Madhabdev, the principal preceptors. Non-adherence to the Hindu varnasrama system and egalitarianism marked its character.\n\nA strictly monotheistic religion, the only form of worship prescribed by this religion is uttering the name of God (\"Sravana-Kirttana\"), who is worshiped in the form of Krishna or Hari. Thus it is also called ek sarana Hari naam dharma. Though a part of the wider Bhakti movement, it does not worship Radha with Krishna which is common in other bhakti movements. It is characterised by the dasya form of worship. Historically, it has been against idol worship, and especially against animal sacrifices common in sakta forms of Hinduism. Noted for its egalitarianism, it posed a serious challenge to Brahminical Hinduism, and converted into its fold people of all castes, ethnicity and religion (including Islam).", "title": "Nagara Naam or Veer Naam", "publishedDate": "2014-03-03T11:26:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "AFjEnsKIveg", "description": "One day into Leg 2 and the boats can still see each other.

Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), Freedonia's principal benefactress, will lend the country 20 million dollars if the president withdraws and places the government in the hands of the \"fearless, progressive\" Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx). At his inauguration, Firefly shows up late, insults everyone in sight, and sings a song about how he intends to abuse his power. Naturally, the crowd cheers wildly. Meanwhile, Ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern) of neighboring Sylvania schemes to oust Firefly and take over Freedonia himself. To gather enough evidence to discredit Firefly, he sends his most trusted spies, Chicolini (Chico Marx) and Pinky (Harpo Marx).

One day, Roxane sent a letter to Adam telling him to go to the park which is the first place they kissed x3 . But Roxane broke up with him D: without saying a reason why . He was so sad and missed her so much, even in his dream, he dreamed about her ( 1:02 - 1:32 is about his dream, he remember the memories, about he and Roxane, and about trying to forget her but he can't ). His home turned into a very cold place because she wasn't there ( like the lyrics x3 ). Suddenly, the cell rang. He picked up. That was the nurse calling him about Roxane's condition ( she had cancer and she wanted to see him for the last time ). He hurriedly drove to the hospital. Finally, he understood the reason why she broke up with him ( because she didn't want to make him sad that she wouldn't live much longer and she wanted him to move along - lol like Haru Haru xD ). Roxane said the last words to him : I love you too ( awww x3 ) and died D: . The next part is about he tried to forget her ( again ).

They are commonly known as weeds or ruderals. The genus is taxonomically very complex, with numerous macrospecies, and polyploidy is also common; over 250 apomictic microspecies have been recorded in the British Isles alone (Richards 1972). Some botanists take a much narrower viewpoint, and only accept a total of about 60 species.\n\nThe leaves are 5-25 cm long, simple and basal, entire or lobed, forming a rosette above the central taproot. As the leaves grow outward they push down the surrounding vegetation, such as grass in a lawn, which kills other plants by cutting off their access to sunlight. A bright yellow flower head, which is open in the daytime but closes at night, is borne singly on a hollow stem (scape) which rises 4-30 cm above the leaves and exudes a milky sap (latex) when broken. A rosette may produce several flowering stems at a time. The flower head is 2-5 cm in diameter and consists entirely of ray florets. The flower head matures into a spherical \"clock\" (also known as \"wishies\") containing many single-seeded fruits (achenes). Each achene is attached to a pappus of fine hairs, which enable wind-aided dispersal over long distances.\n\nDandelions are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). See List of Lepidoptera that feed on dandelions.\n\nAway from their native regions, dandelions have become established in the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand, and are now common throughout all temperate regions.", "title": "man weeding dandelions in field (staged) 5/10/08", "publishedDate": "2008-05-11T18:37:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGCBdElOHcU", "description": "", "title": "Candle Wax Solidifying", "publishedDate": "2009-10-29T02:55:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGCFCnl-ANI", "description": "", "title": "In the Land of Rhinoplasty  - Jingle Punks", "publishedDate": "2014-04-07T16:07:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGCFw2j_fFg", "description": "", "title": "la f\u00e9condation", "publishedDate": "2013-11-21T14:37:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGD6Tb8oZZI", "description": "Hopefully this isn't too try hard.

Regardless of the fact that there are many scale choices, this particular scale works so well over so many different styles and chord changes, that it is some times referred to as a blanket scale.\n\nEven in non-minor chord situations as in the case of innumerable guitar-driven songs, the minor pentatonic is the primary sound. You will hear it over and over again in countless legendary recordings and performances throughout the history of rock and blues guitar. E is also one of the most popular keys on the guitar and often the first place many guitarists learn to solo in.\n\nA very important (and often overlooked by guitarists) aspect of learning scales is to really nail down where the root notes are in every position. With this in mind the exercises on this video all start and end on the root note.", "title": "E Minor Pentatonic Scale Lesson with CAGED Chord Positions Everywhere on the Guitar,", "publishedDate": "2013-02-24T08:26:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGDn26wfN2Q", "description": "Make sure to SUBSCRIBE for all the latest X Factor Australia performances: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTJAIsNx88v0e0nBgQ4PpVA?sub_confirmation=1", "title": "Sydnee Carter: We Found Love - Home Visits - The X Factor Australia 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-08-04T13:30:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGDuOHl6CbA", "description": "Live painting with live music, performed live by painters Tali Farchi and Royce Deans and various musicians from around the world. www.movementeffect.com", "title": "Passionpaintura", "publishedDate": "2009-10-12T18:31:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGE-c003b2w", "description": "ATO Frequency Response Test\n0.25 Hz ~ 6 Hz", "title": "ATO Frequency Response Test", "publishedDate": "2014-03-06T09:58:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGECtSp5_fo", "description": "Fighting rages between Kurdish fighters and Islamic State in the Syrian border town of Kobani, while refugees attempt to re-enter Syria from Turkey to join the battle.

Find out how he chooses investments and what to look for during 2014. http://DailySilverUpdate.com\n\nMaking millions and retiring in your 30s is every investor's dream. But for legendary commodities trader Jim Rogers, it was just the beginning of a career on Wall Street that has spanned six decades and produced a net worth in the hundreds of millions.\n\nRogers' amazing success was built on his uncanny ability to spot long-term trends well before the masses, earning him a reputation as a contrarian. But now, after \"retiring\" at 37, scoring huge gains in commodities in the early 2000s and correctly predicting the financial and housing crisis, Jim Rogers has his sights set squarely on what he calls one of the greatest opportunities he has ever seen.\n\nRogers showed a penchant for business at an early age. His career as an entrepreneur began at age 5 with selling peanuts and picking up empty bottles left behind at baseball games in Alabama. After graduating from Yale University in 1964 with a bachelor's degree in history, Rogers headed to Wall Street and worked as an investment banker, meeting future business partner and billionaire George Soros.\nIn 1973, Rogers and Soros started the legendary Quantum Fund, producing a staggering 4,200% return in the next 10 years while the S&P 500 gained just 42%. That incredible success early in his career enabled Rogers to retire at the age of 37.\nSince then, Rogers has remained active as a private trader and investor, scoring several big wins along the way. He also wrote a well-received book, \"Investment Biker,\" that chronicled his 1990 motorcycle trip around the world.\n\nJim Rogers' Investment Strategy And Big Wins \nRogers uses a top-down economic model. This big-picture worldview guides his investment style: He says he can't time the markets, so he takes a long-term approach.\nRogers is known as a contrarian investor. His willingness to go against the grain and buck popular opinion has produced some of his best ideas.\nRogers has a knack for spotting a long-term trend long before the masses. He was a pioneer in international investing with his Quantum Fund in the 1970s and early '80s. He called the commodities boom in the late '90s, launching his Rogers International Commodity Index in 1998 -- well before the commodities boom of the 2000s ripped across the Street. He also cashed in on the financial crisis of 2008, shorting Fannie Mae before shares crashed from above $60 to just pennies.\n\nRogers is known as a contrarian investor. His willingness to go against the grain and buck popular opinion has produced some of his best ideas. \nThe hallmark of all Rogers' trades and investments is patience. Whether he was waiting for the commodities boom in the early 2000s or betting against financial stocks in 2008, Rogers emphasized the important of patience to execute a great trade or investment: \"I just wait until there is money lying in the corner, and all I have to do is go over there and pick it up. I do nothing in the meantime.\"\nJim Rogers' Portfolio: What's He Holding Now? \nRogers has his sights set squarely on what he calls one of the best investment opportunities he has ever seen: food and agriculture.\n\"We're going to have serious food shortages, not just in America but in the world,\" Rogers has said. \"When I speak to universities and students, I tell them all they should be studying agriculture. The farmers are going to be driving Lamborghinis. ... There are a few parts of the world economy that are going to boom over the next few years -- agriculture is one of them. It's not going to be all disaster.\"\nRogers is also bullish on commodities, saying central banks' easing efforts will support hard assets. He particularly likes precious metals such as gold and silver. In 2011, Rogers said: \"In 1987, stocks went down 40% to 80%. But now you don't even remember 1987 -- it looks like a blip if you look at it. That's what's going to be happening with silver and gold.\"\nRogers is also investing in Asia on the belief that the Eastern Hemisphere is in the early stages of a long-term economic boom. Rogers has said that \"if you were smart in 1807, you moved to London. If you were smart in 1907, you moved to New York City. And if you are smart in 2007, you move to Asia.\"\nThat's exactly what he did, moving to Singapore in 2007 to capitalize on regional growth and enable his daughters to learn Mandarin.\n\n\nFind more price forecasts by Jim Rogers, Peter Schiff, Marc Faber, Max Keiser, Gerald Celente, David Morgan, Bill Murphy, Andy Hoffman, James Rickards and Eric Sprott here: http://dailysilverupdate.com/price-predictions/", "title": "Jim Rogers Investments: Gold, Silver, Commodities, Agriculture: Good Strategy 2015", "publishedDate": "2013-08-07T16:35:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGFp4pJK2zw", "description": "Ultrasuede\u00ae asks High Point Market attendees to share their favorite color for upholstery", "title": "Ultrasuede\u00ae InsideOut: Color", "publishedDate": "2011-06-03T02:37:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGFs5EesK5Q", "description": "My Commander Bly custom.

The question remains as to whether the bright spot seen moving away from the sun was simply debris, or whether a small nucleus of the original ball of ice was still there. Regardless, it is likely that it is now only dust. Comet ISON, which began its journey from the Oort Cloud some 3 million years ago, made its closest approach to the sun on Nov. 28, 2013. The comet was visible in instruments on NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or STEREO, and the joint European Space Agency-NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO, via images called coronagraphs. Coronagraphs block out the sun and a considerable distance around it, in order to better observe the dim structures in the sun's atmosphere, the corona. As such, there was a period of several hours when the comet was obscured in these images, blocked from view along with the sun. During this period of time, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory could not see the comet, leading many scientists to surmise that the comet had disintegrated completely. However, something did reappear in SOHO and STEREO coronagraphs some time later -- though it was significantly less bright. Whether that spot of light was merely a cloud of dust that once was a comet, or if it still had a nucleus -- a small ball of its original, icy material -- intact, is still unclear. It seems likely that as of Dec. 1, there was no nucleus left. By monitoring its changes in brightness over time, scientists can estimate whether there's a nucleus or not, but our best chance at knowing for sure will be if the Hubble Space Telescope makes observations later in December 2013. Regardless of its fate, Comet ISON did not disappoint researchers. Over the last year, observatories around the world and in space gathered one of the largest sets of comet observations of all time, which should provide fodder for study for years to come. The number of space-based, ground-based, and amateur observations were unprecedented, with twelve NASA space-based assets observing over the past year.", "title": "Comet ISON's And its Full Perihelion Pass", "publishedDate": "2013-12-02T22:35:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGHT-PpRFE0", "description": "iTunes Norway, Spotify Norway, Wimp Norway:\nhttp://kampanje.universalmusic.no/ylvis/\n\nIntolerant Spotify (worldwide):\nhttp://open.spotify.com/album/4Gd6mAu6byjvlDbXS6n7dV\n\nIntolerant\u00a0iTunes\u00a0(worldwide):\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/no/album/id940427248\n\nIntolerant\u00a0USA and Canada:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/intolerant-single/id943017677?l=nb&ls=1\n\n\"Volume1\" USA and Canada:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/volume-1/id943021873?l=nb&ls=1\n\nMusic:\u00a0M.Eriksen/T.E.Hermansen/V.Ylvis\u00ad\u00e5ker/B.Yl\u00advis\u00e5ker\nLyrics: V.Ylvis\u00e5ker/B.Ylvis\u00e5ker/C.L\u00f8chst\u00f8er\n\nDirector: Harald Zwart, Motion Blur\nProduced by Concorde TV\n\nSBS Discovery \u00a9 2014", "title": "Ylvis - Intolerant [Official music video HD]", "publishedDate": "2014-11-18T21:23:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGHgyPl9B64", "description": "Kay\u0131t - Harabe Records \n\nhttps://twitter.com/Gesto_16", "title": "Gestapo - Ad\u0131m Ad\u0131m Hiphop", "publishedDate": "2014-06-03T20:05:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGHyB9MsMho", "description": "Parenting style affects children's well-being and proneness to abusing substances.", "title": "Parenting Style", "publishedDate": "2007-06-29T01:11:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGI-AaCiOSM", "description": "Amazing Musical Tribute", "title": "Bettina Pennon doing a Musical Tribute to Bishop FAW  at In", "publishedDate": "2012-05-22T18:54:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGI-KXQobQo", "description": "", "title": "21APR12 THAILAND's NEWS ; PART1", "publishedDate": "2012-04-21T21:39:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGID3M9GB4A", "description": "Kechua cantando  desde la plaza de las culturas en piedras negras coahuila,, el me mintio la incluye en su primer cd KECHUA .", "title": "Kechua - El me Mintio", "publishedDate": "2009-03-02T17:23:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGITpMGk2wQ", "description": "A real easy solution keeping the rabbits cool in the summer.", "title": "Canadian Rabbit Hutch Sun Shade", "publishedDate": "2014-07-10T01:01:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGIYzO_qmxM", "description": "Cobblestone Generators from Ok to Best :D", "title": "How to make 3 Diffrent Cobblestone Generators [Good For Sky Block's]", "publishedDate": "2013-01-01T00:42:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGIeoIFay98", "description": "I'm not sure what this one is.

The input devices are a pen-operated graphics tablet, a touch-operated graphics tablet, a Microsoft Kinect for hand tracking and a Nintendo Wii Nunchuk controller. The pen and tablet interface proved most efficient and preferred by the teachers and is used in evaluation of navigation and selection interfaces using the device. In a second experiment with the teachers, they significantly preferred a grabbing the air navigation interface over a joystick-inspired interface. The results show no significant preferences between a gaze directed pointing interface and an image-plane interface when evaluating selection methods.

They are found in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Australia. They are found mainly on the coast and in inland wetlands where they feed on dead fish and other prey. Adults have a reddish brown plumage and a contrasting white head and breast which makes them easy to distinguish from other birds of prey.\n\n The Brahminy Kite is about the same size as the Black Kite and has a typical kite flight, with wings angled, but its tail is rounded unlike the Red Kite and Black Kite, which have forked tails.\n The Brahminy Kite was first described by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert in 1783. Four subspecies are recognized.\n\n This kite is a familiar sight in the skies of Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and southeast Asia and as far south as New South Wales, Australia, through which region it is widespread and resident. It is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\n\n The breeding season in South Asia is from December to April. In Australia, it is August to October, and April to June. Both parents take part in nest building and feeding but it is suggested that only the female incubates.\n\n It is primarily a scavenger, feeding mainly on dead fish and crabs, especially in wetlands and marshland but occasionally hunts live prey such as hares and bats.They may also indulge in kleptoparasitism and attempt to steal prey from other birds.\n Young birds may indulge in play behaviour, dropping leaves and attempting to catch them in the air. When fishing over water, they may sometimes land in the water but manage to swim and take off without much trouble.\n\n They roost communally on large and isolated trees and as many as 600 have been seen at just one location.\n\n They may mob larger raptors such as the Aquila eagles. In some incidents where Brahminy Kites mobbed Steppe Eagles they were attacked and injured or killed.\n\n Yellow Wagtail\n ===========\n The Yellow Wagtail, Motacilla flava, is a small passerine in the wagtail family Motacillidae, which also includes the pipits and longclaws.\n\n This species breeds in much of temperate Europe and Asia and has a foothold in North America in Alaska.\n\n It is a slender 15-16 cm long bird, with the characteristic long, constantly wagging tail of its genus. It is the shortest tailed of the European wagtails.\n\n The call is a characteristic high-pitched jeet.\n\n This insectivorous bird inhabits open country near water, such as wet meadows. It nests in tussocks, laying 4-8 speckled eggs.\n\n Grey Wagtail\n ==========\n The Grey Wagtail (Motacilla cinerea) is a small member of the wagtail family, Motacillidae. The species looks similar to the Yellow Wagtail but has the yellow on its underside restricted to the throat and vent. The species is widely distributed, with several populations breeding in Europe and Asia and migrating to tropical regions in Asia and Africa.\n\n They are usually seen on open marshy ground or meadows where they walk solitarily or in pairs along the ground, capturing insects that are disturbed. Like other wagtails, they frequently wag their tail and fly low with undulations and they have a sharp call that is often given in flight.\n\n They also use rocks in water and will often perch on trees. They have a clear sharp call note and the song consists of trills.\n This species was first described by Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 Ornithologia Britannica.\n\n The breeding season is April to July and the nest is placed near fast running streams or rivers on an embankment between stones and roots.They live for a maximum of 8 years in the wild.These birds feed on a variety of aquatic invertebrates including adult flies, mayflies, beetles, crustacea and molluscs.\nMusic by Carlos & Miguel from Jamendo.com", "title": "Nature and Trees -  Brahminy Kite ,Yellow Wagtail ,Grey Wagtail & Spotted Dove With Many Other Birds", "publishedDate": "2012-04-09T14:02:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGN__InH_ZE", "description": "FREE NOLLYWOOD MOVIES:\nA couple at the break of losing their marriage decides to relocate to Kumasi Ghana where their love story started in other to rekindle their fading love.\nDavid (Jim Iyke) believes his wife is Kezia (Yvonne nelson) is losing her sanity as she constantly hears strange scary voices in there house and sees strange things, the house is hunted by a spirit being only Kezia can hear and see, Kezia needs the help of a powerful Rev. father to unravel this mystery.\nThis intriguing, suspense filled thriller will keep you at the edge of your seat till the end credit roles.\nThis LATEST NOLLYWOOD movie; deadly obsession is a must watch.\nWatch many other hot new movies, at the link below\n\nhttp://www.IbakaTv.com/", "title": "Yvonne Nelson In Ghost House", "publishedDate": "2012-12-10T17:13:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGNe5jsQ4DU", "description": "http://www.BlankTV.com - Suede Razors - \"Boys Night Out\" - Like this video?

Combining elements of 70\u2019s punk, pub-rock, bootboy glam, and mod revival, they\u2019ve created their own hard-hitting brand of amped-up retro rock n\u2019 roll. \n\nThe group originated as a \u2018side project\u2019 creatively deviating from current bands, to fuse together the power and energy of punk with swaggery guitar riffs and big beats from the 60s and 70s. With momentum from the success of their two previously released singles, the band is now preparing for their 3rd single which will be released in Fall 2014 on Pirates Press Records (USA) / Randale Records (Europe). The release will coincide with their live debut at the Pirates Press 10th Anniversary Party in San Francisco on October 25th, 2014 where they will play alongside Cock Sparrer, Bouncing Souls, Street Dogs, and Bishops Green.\n\n \nDirector Name: Paul Stevens\n \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SuedeRazors\n \nLabel Name: Pirates Press Records\nLabel Website: http://www.piratespressrecords.com/\n \n \n***\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/r/BlankTV", "title": "Suede Razors - \"Boys Night Out\" A BlankTV World Premiere!", "publishedDate": "2014-11-11T19:56:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGO7g3-tZCo", "description": "Jurors have reached a verdict in the trial of a Detroit-area man who argued self-defense in the fatal shooting of Renisha McBride, an unarmed woman on his porch.\n\nCount 1 -- Guilty of second-degree murder\nCount 2 - Guilty of Statuary Manslaughter \nCount 3 - Guilty of Felony Firearm\n\nNote: Comments including profanity will be removed.", "title": "RAW VIDEO: Theodore Wafer found guilty of second degree murder", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T19:36:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGOUldTrk-A", "description": "Classic Mood Experience\nThe best masterpieces ever recorded\nsubscribe to ours channel\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/classicmoodexp\n\nGlenn Miller\nSongs Remastered\n\nRemastered @ Oakwood Studio\nokwstudio@gmail.com", "title": "Glenn Miller - Pennsylvania 6-5000\u00a0(1940) [Digitally Remastered]", "publishedDate": "2013-02-22T23:00:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGOmxNsB6iU", "description": "Download link: https://hotfile.com/dl/165914862/20fcbd3/Jargon_-_BeatJ_2_Crunk.rar.html", "title": "Jargon Beat - Kolye", "publishedDate": "2012-08-07T14:56:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGOtEuDw1Zo", "description": "spectacle de OUF a DOUALA, merci au dernier des MC: Mr KERY JAMES... et aux artistes CAMEROUNAIS ( KROTAL, BOUDHOR , GENERAL VALSERO)", "title": "kery james ft krotal ,boudhor, general valsero \"DOUALA C'EST LE BARCA\"", "publishedDate": "2014-02-11T11:23:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGOta-emBZY", "description": "MEU GOL GRAFITADO PELO NEB: Green Room Studio - 51 3084-9093 \n\nPAGINA NO FACE: http://www.facebook.com/jukaflores01\nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/jukaflores \nINSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/jukaflores\n\nMusica: Banda Nose - Nomade", "title": "GOL GRAFITADO NEB ART", "publishedDate": "2014-02-07T23:48:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGP28otU-oE", "description": "Best friends", "title": "Best friends Nadeen and Andrena", "publishedDate": "2014-03-16T06:16:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGP4SpWksUs", "description": "This is my first video showing you how to make an inverted fishtail bracelet with loom bands.\n\n\"Wallpaper\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nWebsite for music: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/\nEditing and uploading by: http://www.youtube.com/user/SilverSkeletron/\n\nComment potato if you see this and thanks for watching! :)", "title": "Loom Bands - How to make an Inverted Fishtail Bracelet!

Its black and white plumage, crest and the habit of hovering over clear lakes and rivers before diving for fish makes it distinctive. Males have a double band across the breast while females have a single gorget that is often broken in the middle. They are usually found in pairs or small family parties. When perched, they often bob their head and flick up their tail.\n\nThis kingfisher is about 17 cm long and is white with a black mask, a white supercilium and black breast bands. The crest is neat and the upperparts are barred in black. Several subspecies are recognized within the broad distribution. The nominate race is found in sub-Saharan Africa, extending into West Asia. A former subspecies syriaca is considered as merely a larger northern bird of the nominate species (following Bergmann's rule). Subspecies leucomelanura is found from Afghanistan east into India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Laos. The subspecies travancoreensis of the Western Ghats is darker with the white reduced. Subspecies C. r. insignis is found in Hainan and southeastern China and has a much larger bill. Males have a narrow second breast-band while females have a single broken breast band.\n\nSource :- Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

This project investigates the\nopportunity to develop spaces that induce real interaction to dwellers by means of  interactive environments, pushing the threshold between physical/virtual social\n\nThe arcade as an architectural condition is much like Walter Benjamin's idea of \"montage-like\" spaces, instigating users to notice their own senses of spatial perception/interaction.\n\nThe opportunity to use the arcades as an interactive field comes from  its\ncontextual condition as \"almost\" removed from the city. Connecting public hubs the interactive arcades is a multidisciplinary approach to a cultural context as information systems restructure social behavior. Urban spaces must be inclusive enough to\nallow people to cross the threshold of virtual and real socialization intuitively.\n\nFor the space to interact with its user it must reflect the behavior of its dwellers;\nthe system is underspecified to enable dwellers to actively construct  their own rules of interaction and spatial transformation.\nMovement is the key factor by which we understand space and is used to redefine the arcade. Specific conditions of how the body navigate space were isolated ( watch video ),\ndefining nine criterias to activate the space based on time and kinesthesia.\n\nThis way it becomes visible to the user not only their position  toward others, \na record of their interactions registering meeting places and areas where one might stay for extended periods of time. \nAll of these mechanisms are an attempt redefine the place, to record and generate social interaction in physical space, as well as users interacting solely from the internet.\n\nAs the glass shell was the reinvention of public arcades in the 1940's the Interactive Surface can functions as the new armature to social spaces.", "title": "THE ARCADES OF NYC", "publishedDate": "2013-10-09T18:23:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGR_Z-PO6i4", "description": "Application d'un filtre noir et blanc sur une photo que l'utilisateur choisit.", "title": "Nancy-GR2-CH03-BlackAndWhiteChallenge", "publishedDate": "2014-02-20T12:59:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGRcr8U-WlM", "description": "Tune in Sundays at 9/8c.\nSubscribe to OWN: http://bit.ly/18Lz0rV\n\nIn December 2006, Grammy award winning singer and actress Brandy was involved in a chain reaction accident on the Los Angeles Freeway.

New ADENOFLEX helps your muscles remain more pumped after your workouts and promote greater exercise-induced lean mass and strength gains. ADENOFLEX is heavily dosed with active ingredients which research suggests encourage bigger, longer-lasting post-training pumps. This is achieved by supporting expansion, a.k.a. \"volumization\", at the blood, plasma and muscle cell levels. Importantly, ADENOFLEX provides benefits both acutely (i.e. after one use) and chronically (i.e. with repeated use). FORMULA ADVANTAGES. 600 mg of purity-tested agmatine per scoop. Anecdotally, agmatine is used by advanced bodybuilders and others to support overall muscle volume and pumps. Animal studies suggest that it may also support healthy nerve performance. 600 mg of n-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) per scoop. NAC has been added to support hematogenesis, or blood building. In turn, this promotes bigger pumps during and after workouts. In a clinical study, men receiving 600 mg of NAC twice daily (1200 mg total) for 8 days increased erythropoietin (EPO)(+26%), hemoglobin (+9%) and hematocrit (+9%) at rest and after exercise. On the basis of these findings, it is recommended that users load with ADENOFLEX by taking 2 servings daily for the first 8 days, and 1 serving daily thereafter. More than 100% of the dose of creatine monohydrate shown to boost plasma volume by 14%. Plasma represents over half of blood volume and therefore substantially impacts your potential for pumps. Chromium 454, a novel \"food form\" of chromium created by reacting trivalent chromium with high-activity, water-soluble molecules from a proprietary GRAS brewer's yeast extract. In vitro, Chromium 454 has been shown to increase glucose uptake in human muscle cells by up to 3-fold, outperforming other forms of chromium. Glucose is required to replenish muscle glycogen levels post-training and supports muscle volumization. Ursolic acid and betaine have been added to ADENOFLEX because of their potential nutrient partitioning properties. Studied performed by University of Iowa researchers indicate that ursolic acid enhances lean muscle mass and thermogenic brown fat. In turn, this encourages greater calorie burning and protection from fat gain.", "title": "GAT Adenoflex - THE POST-TRAINING PUMP!", "publishedDate": "2014-04-20T22:13:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGW5kuLUM84", "description": "part 1", "title": "a very old and nice song for saddam hussein", "publishedDate": "2007-03-26T20:02:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGWiZLy0YuI", "description": "Filmmaker and adventurer Dean Potter doesn't always BASE jump alone.

The crew of team owner and throttleman Angelo Tedeschi and his new pilot Aaron Ciantar dominated the SuperSport event that got the race weekend off to a great start, quickly opening a dominant 30-second lead over their nearest rivals and extended that by a further 10 seconds by the chequered flag.

TWITTER: http://twitter.com/cnforbiddennews\nLike us on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/chinaforbiddennews\n\nRecently, mainland media reported that former Party Secretary\nXia Zhengui, who was removed from his position after\nthe Shanxi Xiangfen Dam incident, attended a public event\nas Shanxi Provincial Deputy Minister of the United Front Department.\n\nThis news attracted much attention.\n\nCompared to an extensive coverage of his removal,\nhis return was rather quiet.\n\nIn fact, the comeback of a corrupt official of the Chinese\nCommunist Party (CCP) is nothing new.\n\nSome netizens said, ironically, they were merely\non \"paid leave,\" and their returning is only a matter of time.\n\nIn 2008, Xia was removed from his post as party secretary.\n\nFive years later, he is back as the deputy minister of Shanxi\nProvincial Party United Front Ministry.\n\nRegarding 'tainted' officials being promoted, netizens\nquestion the existence of an \"accountability system.\"\nSome netizens jokingly said that these corrupt officials\nwere not being punished, but were on paid leave.\n\nZhu Xinxin, former radio editor: \"Many corrupt officials were\nexposed by ordinary citizens, and the CCP had no choice but to deal with them.\n\nBy temporarily removing them from their positions,\nthe CCP deceives the public.\n\nAfter a short period, they will return to work at a different\nlocation and in a different job.\n\nOutsiders believe that moving up, not down,\nis the collective manifestation of the CCP's officialdom.\"\n\nZhu Xinxin: \"Now this CCP bureaucracy has completely\nprivatized the officialdom, they are no longer public servants.\n\nOfficials share a common interest among themselves,\nand grassroots officials share a common interest with the Chinese Communist regime.\n\nWhen one official falls, the interests of others\nwill be affected.\nTherefore, they are trying their best to protect each other.\"\n\nProfessor Zhao Shilin at National University said on his blog:\nIt is not normal for most officials to come back after\ntheir removal.\n\nFor example, the dismissed official due to the Sanlu\n(the company that produced the tainted baby formula)\nincident was promoted to deputy director of the State Food\nand Drug Administration.\n\nIt is a vicious crime for the CCP to shelter them.\n\nIn 2008, the Sanlu milk scandal shocked\nthe whole world.\nLi Changjiang, former director of AQSIQ (Administration\nof Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine) was dismissed.\n\nLi Changjiang was re-appointed as deputy director\nof the national anti-pornography group, an important job.\n\nSix other officials involved in the Sanlu incident\nhave all returned to work or have been promoted.\n\nProfessor Zhu Lijia from the National School of Administration\nsaid under a modern civilized political system, the comeback\nof corrupt officials is minimal because they are held\naccountable.\nIt is very difficult for Western countries to picture\nthese phenomena.\n\nIndependent commentator Zhang Jian: \"In the US,\nofficials are public servants, and people will use their votes\nto voice their opinions.\nIn China, it is totally different.\n\nA one-party dictatorship means all party cadres\nare a part of the party.\n\nTheir fundamental starting point is not the masses,\nbut how to maintain the one-party dictatorship.\"\n\nThe Federal Supreme Court lawyer Zhang Jun said that\nin the US, after officials resigned, they can start businesses,\nwrite books, teach in universities, join think tanks,\nand do public service.\n\nHowever, it is extremely hard for them\nto make a political comeback.\n\nBy contrast, in Mainland China, officials are dismissed first,\nand after a cooling period, they quietly return.\n\nIf someone questions the authorities, they would respond\nthat these officials meet the requirement.\n\nIn the end, the entire matter is dropped.", "title": "Corrupt Officials on Paid Leave

Molen\nScreenwriter: Tom Cruise, Robert Towne\nFilm Description: The Top Gun team of producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, director Tony Scott, and superstar Tom Cruise reunite for this excursion into stock-car racing that incorporates the vroom and rumble of deafening car engines with a rehash of the same elements that worked so effectively in Cruise's Top Gun, The Color of Money, and Cocktail. Cruise plays stock-car driver Cole Trickle, a young fireball on the Southern stock-car circuit who has loads of talent but no conception of how to channel that talent in to racing success. When Tim Daland (Randy Quaid) commissions veteran stock-car racer Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) to built a car and hires Cole to drive it, Harry must instill in Cole his philosophy of winning and teach him how to channel his raw talent into success -- or, as Harry puts it, \"controlling something that's out of control.\" Cole immediately comes into conflict with the circuit's star driver, Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker), and their hijinks on the track causes them to smash up their cars and lands them both in the hospital. Because of his injuries, Rowdy is forced to withdraw from the circuit competition. With no rival to torment, Rowdy becomes Cole's supporter and friend, while Cole revs up his motors for Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman), the attractive brain specialist who supervises Cole's recovery from the crackup. Cole's health is restored, and he begins to race again, chastened and hanging onto Harry's every word. Cole appears to have centered himself for success, but in an orgasmic grand finale, Cole must compete against Russ Wheeler (Cary Elwes), a dastardly driver who not only wants to see Cole defeated but permanently disabled.\n\n\"days of thunder\",\"days of thunder clip\",\"days of thunder soundtrack\",\"days of thunder trailer\",\"tom cruise\",\"john c reilly\",\"robert duvall\",\"randy quaid\",\"michael rooker\",\"tony scott\",\"car videos\",\"helmet videos\",\"romantic dramas\",\"sports dramas\",\"auto racing\",romance,\"sports stories\",\"gerald r molen\",\"jerry bruckheimer\",\"racetrack videos\",\"cole trickle\",\"harry hogge\",\"tim daland\",\"rowdy burns\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++12662,/m/07r1h,/m/015c4g,/m/01w23w,/m/02qgyv,/m/02_ntx", "title": "Days of Thunder (1/9) Movie CLIP - Dropping the Hammer (1990) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-09T07:21:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGk3C1Eab4Y", "description": "Esse epis\u00f3dio \u00e9 o 26\u00ba epis\u00f3dio, e \u00faltimo, da 2\u00aa temporada da s\u00e9rie M\u00f4nica Toy.

It is located in the southern region of the Malay Peninsula, on the Straits of Malacca. It borders Negeri Sembilan to the north and the state of Johor to the south. The state's capital is Malacca Town. This historical city centre has been listed as a prominent World Heritage Site of UNESCO since 7 July 2008.\n\nAlthough Malacca was once one of the oldest Malay sultanates, the state has no Sultan today. Instead, the head of state is the Yang di-Pertua Negeri or Governor.\n\nThe tourism and manufacturing sectors are the two most important sectors in the state economy. Malacca has adopted as its slogan, \"Visiting Malacca Means Visiting Malaysia\" (\"Melawat Melaka Bererti Melawati Malaysia\"). It is rich in cultural heritage and bears several places of historical interest.\n\nMalacca holds up several modern shopping complexes to attract more visitors to the state. Examples include Mahkota Parade Shopping Centre at Plaza Mahkota (City Centre), Dataran Pahlawan Melaka Megamall (which is situated on the historical field of Padang Pahlawan, where Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al Haj announced the independence day of the Federation Of Malaya), Melaka Mall Shopping Complex (formerly known as Kotamas Shopping Complexe), A'Famosa Safari and Theme Park and Plaza Melaka Raya at the Taman Melaka Raya.\n\nMalacca also has its very own hypermarket and departmental store. A few examples include Parkson Departmental Store (Mahkota Parade and Melaka Mall), Jusco Supermarket and Departmental Store (Ayer Keroh and coming soon near Melaka Sentral), Tesco Hypermarket and Giant Hypermarket at Bachang Utama; also a Supermarket at (Mahkota Parade).\n\nApart from tourism, Malacca is also a manufacturing centre for products ranging from food and consumer products, through high-tech weaponry and automotive components to electronic and computer parts. There are at least 23 industrial estates that houses some 500 factories from the United States, Germany, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore.\n\nInfo Taken from Wikipedia.com\nCredits to Wikipedia.com\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malacca\n\nMain", "title": "Shopping in Malacca by Asiatravel.com", "publishedDate": "2009-09-16T10:02:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGrXO747q5w", "description": "I created this video with the YouTube Video Editor (http://www.youtube.com/editor)", "title": "Chris Jericho talks about Ralphus", "publishedDate": "2014-03-02T21:15:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGrlKugEFu4", "description": "Sweet Langboard move by young Laird", "title": "Laird Hamilton Longboard", "publishedDate": "2007-02-11T14:02:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "AGs5X14_qG0", "description": "Find hundreds of grilling recipes: http://www.myrecipes.com/summer-grilling/\n\nHere's how to cook with indirect heat on gas and charcoal grills.

Refer to manufacturer\ninstallation instructions and specs for complete information.\n\nToday we are going to show you part number 1980A it is a Genuine Bearing Buddy trailer wheel bearing protector. The part number actually stands for 1.98 inches. It is shown here because it is the most popular bearing cover size for all 3,500 pound axles. It also works with most 2,000 pound axles and hubs that are out there. What these do is replace the regular dust cap that is on your hub. That gets taken off and everything stays the same on the inside. You do want to pack just a little bit of grease in these. Then what happens is it gets installed and hammered into place. Do make sure you put a wooden block between this and the hammer. You will also see there is a Zerk fitting on this. Once you have the bearing protector installed you fill it up with grease and just fill up enough until the spring starts moving out.\n\nIf there is air trapped inside there or grease it will actually work down behind the spring valve around and behind this blue ring here. When it is completely full the spring will push it out. Once it goes flat that means it is time to add more grease in there. Normally you want to move it a 8th of an inch and push it back down and add more grease to work out the air. After you have it installed it comes with the bearing cover that covers up the entire thing. What that does that any grease to flow up and out will be stopped by the cover. That way grease does not spread all over you wheels while you are going down the road. The bearing buddies do come in an assortment of different sizes. Again the one on the left is the 1980A is the only one with the lube indicator. Everything else stays the same, the operation stays the same for all of these the only thing that changes is the size of the hub you are working with.\n\nAs you can see here we have 3 different sizes of these Bearing Buddies. Again they go by model number so the one to the far left is 19.38. The one in the middle is 23.28 and the one to the right would be 20.47. Remember putting a decimal after the first 2 numbers and you have the and that gives you exact size hub you are working with. One of the other nice details of that obviously the point of these are to keep the water and dirt out of the bearings. So the components inside are all stainless steel and the automatic pressure control prevents the hub seal from leakage. If the grease gets hot or the air inside gets hot the spring will come out and release the hot air. There you have it for the Genuine Bearing Buddy part number 1980A.\nVideos are provided as a guide only.

Located in the valley of the Chao Phraya River, the city was founded in 1350 by King U Thong, who went there to escape a smallpox outbreak in Lop Buri and proclaimed it the capital of his kingdom, often referred to as the Ayutthaya kingdom or Siam. Ayutthaya became the second Siamese capital after Sukhothai. Its remains, characterized by the prang (reliquary towers) and gigantic monasteries, give an idea of its past splendour. It is estimated that Ayutthaya by the year 1600 CE had a population of about 300,000, with the population perhaps reaching 1,000,000 around 1700 CE, making it one of the world's largest cities at that time. In 1767, the city was destroyed by the Burmese army, resulting in the collapse of the kingdom. The Ayutthaya historical park is the ruins of the former capital of the Kingdom of Siam. It is the site of sacked and destruction of the Ayutthaya city, its art and buildings by the Burmese in 1767, which is recognized internationally as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city was refounded a few kilometers to the east. The city is sometimes called \"Venice of the East\".\n\nSource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

In Perennial Vegetables the adventurous gardener will find information, tips, and sound advice on less common edibles that will make any garden a perpetual, lowmaintenance source of food.\n\nImagine growing vegetables that require just about the same amount of care as the flowers in your perennial beds and borders--no annual tilling and planting. They thrive and produce abundant and nutritious crops throughout the season. It sounds too good to be true, but in Perennial Vegetables author and plant specialist Eric Toensmeier (Edible Forest Gardens) introduces gardeners to a world of little-known and wholly underappreciated plants. Ranging beyond the usual suspects (asparagus, rhubarb, and artichoke) to include such \"minor\" crops as ground cherry and ramps (both have found their way onto exclusive restaurant menus) and the much sought-after, antioxidant-rich wolfberry (also known as goji berries), Toensmeier explains how to raise, tend, harvest, and cook with plants that yield great crops and satisfaction.\n\nPerennial vegetables are perfect as part of an edible landscape plan or permaculture garden. Profiling more than a hundred species, with dozens of color photographs and illustrations, and filled with valuable growing tips, recipes, and resources, Perennial Vegetables is a groundbreaking and ground-healing book that will open the eyes of gardeners everywhere to the exciting world of edible perennials.", "title": "Eric Toensmeier, author of Perennial Vegetables, tours his perennial root crop.", "publishedDate": "2008-11-26T03:31:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "AH5OVXMjsEk", "description": "Garden Symphylans", "title": "Symphylan", "publishedDate": "2012-10-21T20:15:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "AH5WenSFsQY", "description": "This tutorial shows how to use Sub-Surface Scattering with MAX LIVE.", "title": "RandomControl MAX LIVE tutorial: Sub-Surface Scattering (SSS)", "publishedDate": "2012-12-17T23:36:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "AH5_sKwDw1E", "description": "This is my goodbye...\n_____________________\n\nVideo and Illustration by 6Lin\nhttp://shivatenshitan.deviantart.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/rokurinnn\nVocals by Hatsune Miku V3 English\nSong by CircusP\nInstrumental + VSQ: https://app.box.com/s/r5kmiyars38yqrfxgqwj\nAlt.
