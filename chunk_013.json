He was a descendant of a brother of King Penda, who had ruled Mercia in the middle of the 7th century. He succeeded Ecgfrith, the son of Offa; Ecgfrith only reigned for five months, and Coenwulf ascended to the throne in the same year that Offa died. In the early years of Coenwulf's reign he had to deal with a revolt in Kent, which had been under Offa's control. Eadberht Pr\u00e6n returned from exile in Francia to claim the Kentish throne, and Coenwulf was forced to wait for papal support before he could intervene. When Pope Leo agreed to anathematize Eadberht, Coenwulf invaded and retook the kingdom; Eadberht was taken prisoner, was blinded, and had his hands cut off. Coenwulf also appears to have lost control of the kingdom of East Anglia during the early part of his reign, as an independent coinage appears under King Eadwald. Coenwulf's coinage reappears in 805, indicating that the kingdom was again under Mercian control. Several campaigns of Coenwulf's against the Welsh are recorded, but only one conflict with Northumbria, in 801, though it is likely that Coenwulf continued to support the opponents of the Northumbrian king Eardwulf.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC:BA 3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenwulf_of_Mercia\n\nText to Speech powered by TTS-API.COM\n\nImages are Public Domain", "title": "All About - Coenwulf of Mercia", "publishedDate": "2014-07-25T15:52:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-kyZj6e-hQA", "description": "A look at student/ youth protests in various places in the US in the 1960s\n\nSee more videos at http://www.adiamondfilms.com/\nLike us on https://www.facebook.com/adiamondfilms", "title": "For What Its Worth...Youth Protests in the 1960s", "publishedDate": "2013-10-31T03:05:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-kyaZJ57jWg", "description": "Remove a cork without a corkscrew by wrapping the wine bottle in a towel and hitting it against a vertical wall to get the cork to push its way out.

The numbers of the Atlantic wolffish are rapidly being depleted, most likely due to overfishing and bycatch, and is currently a Species of Concern according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service. Although it looks fearsome, the Atlantic wolffish is only a threat to humans when defending itself out of the water.\n\nApart from their unique appearance wolffish are distinguished by the natural antifreeze they produce to keep their blood moving fluidly in their very cold habitat, involvement by both the male and female in brood bearing, and the large size of their eggs. They are also an important factor in controlling green crab and sea urchin populations, which can become overly disruptive to habitats if left unchecked. Wolffish population success is also an important indicator of the health of other bottom-dweller populations, such as cod. /Wikipedia/", "title": "WOLFFISH", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T21:19:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-l57PpIqQpM", "description": "http://www.hoya.sk/rady-a-tipy/1440-dopestujte-si-rodinne-astie", "title": "Helexine - Soleirolia soleirolii", "publishedDate": "2014-02-27T19:09:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "-l5Fs48GKgQ", "description": "Forever young!", "title": "Sweapsound pres.

He made me stronger, that I might make YOU.\n\nAnd now YOU growing stronger, that you might make too.\n\nThe next man in line, like a moment in time, will look behind and there he will find.\n\nYou who grew strong, with my foot on your back, forcing you to keep his focus on track.\nLike I did you, and he did me, the forces of strength grow like family tree.\n\nA friut does not grow without branch, without trunk, the nourishing soil underfoot, not up front.\n\nTo lead is bow. To teach is to grow. To coach is to know. That when the wind blow, the tree unmoved, in the earth it is stuck\n\nAnd I stand behind YOU to push YOU up front.\n\nYOU get the sun, YOU feel the rain.\n\nAnd I'll keep you strong, from behind I'll remain.\n\nELLIOTT'S BOOKS & PRODUCTS:\n\n7 Strategies For A Stronger Nervous System: http://hulsestrength.com/go/super-nerves\n\nThe Grow Stronger Method: http://growstrongermethod.com/\n\nAdvanced Strength Course: http://strengthology.net/advanced-strength/\n\nStrength Camp Workouts: http://hulsestrength.com/go/strength-camp-workouts-2\n\nLean Hybrid Muscle: http://buildhybridmuscle.com/\n\nGridiron Domination: http://www.footballstrengthprogram.com/\n\nStrength Camp T Shirt: http://strengthcamp.spreadshirt.com/\n\n\nRECOMMENDED RESOURCES:\n\nStrategic Cardio: http://www.hulsestrength.com/recommends/cardio\n\nRenegade Diet: http://www.hulsestrength.com/recommends/renegade-diet\n\nDeadlift Dynamite: http://www.hulsestrength.com/recommends/deadlift-yt\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTS:\n\nHypergain Creatine: http://www.hulsestrength.com/recommends/hypergain-2", "title": "\"To lead people, walk behind them\" - LAO TZU: Tribute To Coaches Poem by Elliott Hulse", "publishedDate": "2013-07-06T14:38:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-lA4755xjZk", "description": "Tow head snake eating mice", "title": "snake", "publishedDate": "2012-08-27T06:04:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-lA9_mog6lw", "description": "No description.", "title": "WWE Top 10 Best Cruiserweight Champions Of all Time", "publishedDate": "2013-08-27T19:58:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "-lAuFrW068Q", "description": "ANALOG DRUM SYNTH! and a BASS / LEAD SYNTH new from Vermona, respected name in modern midi controlled analog sound gear.

Now, what we're going to go over today is a cable crossover for your upper chest. You got it? Cool. \n\nNow, it's very similar to the regular cable crossover, but the only difference is your weight's going to be coming from a little bit below you and you're going to be pulling right in front of your face. So, you're coming from a little bit below you, right in front of your face. If we take a look at the muscles I'm recruiting by keeping my arms up you'll see that I'm recruiting my upper pec and my shoulder.\n\nOkay? This is how we do it. Let's grab hold of these handles. And again, we're making sure that they're coming from a little bit below us. And we're pulling up across the face, cross. Alright, up across the face, cross. Now, you're getting a lot of upper pec as you can see. You're going to get a lot of shoulder especially when you get to this position. \n\nNow, if your goal is just to work the bulk of the chest this may not be the one for you, because when you get to the very end position your chest actually relaxes and it goes all into your shoulder. You'll be able to see it here. If you were able to touch me right here you'd see that now this is much softer than it would be if I was doing the flat press coming across the chest. All of these exercises that require you to use the cable press are going to be very dependent on the position of your arms and the position of your resistance. Okay?\n\nLet's pull across again. You see the crossover. Slow on the way down. One more time. \n\nThat is a cable crossover for your upper chest.", "title": "How to Do Upper Chest Cable Crossover | Chest Workout", "publishedDate": "2012-08-09T00:22:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-lHSy8arfaw", "description": "", "title": "clooney.3GP", "publishedDate": "2011-03-26T23:08:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "-lHerfruxMU", "description": "", "title": "Mariah and linnaea on slingshot myrtle beach", "publishedDate": "2012-03-05T23:57:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "-lHetnNNSc8", "description": "Just because new tablets are hitting the market, it doesn't mean you need to get rid of your old one so fast.

Today I will teach you another way, which I myself used when I was little. This method will help you make a good and convenient prototype board with the help of a certain number of tools, but without textolite. In order to do that we will need the following: a sheet of plyboard, cardboard or pressboard, small pieces of steel or brass, brass wire, or, if that is not available, steel wire with copper coating - it's very good that many clips today are made of steel with copper coating. As for the tools, we will need an awl, a screwdriver, straight and bent pliers, wire cutters and scissors. And, just like always, it would be good if you have a soldering iron and fluxes. So, the first thing we need to do is to make lamels. Lamels are the contact groups of your prototype board. They are, in fact, the bands that need to be cut out from your work material. After that, the plate that you have cut out needs to be bent and straightened. You need to make ten such lamels. Then you need to make buses. This is most conveniently done with the help of brass wire, or, if you don't have that, just take a steel wire with copper coating or a regular hookup wire. When all of the parts are ready, you need to make holes in your base - four round holes for the buses and 10 straight ones for the lamels.And your prototype is almost ready. All you need to do now is just tin it. This board is good for assembling pilot designs. But if you are looking for a permanent solution, it would be best to just go with a real printed circuit board.", "title": "Self-Made Prototype Board", "publishedDate": "2010-11-29T23:44:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "-lL9dLjkeFw", "description": "Has this ever happened to you?

I want to thank you for watching our video! Now that there are a lot more people watching it I would like to answer a few of your questions and concerns:\n\nFirst, My best friend Christy and I have been riding since before we were walking, so we know how to ride. Currently I am on a college equestrian team and Christy is on a college rodeo team. \n\nBoth of these horses are ours and they are spoiled beyond belief and, yes, they are trained to rear ON COMMAND. For those of you upset about big bits, direct contact, ripping their mouths and all the horrible things we've done, please turn your sound on. The command for Solo, the horse on the right is squeezing with your legs, saying c'mon, and only enough rein to not let her walk forward. Kawya, the horse on the right is squeezing with your leg and clucking, and the video shows very clearly that I am not ripping on her face. Also they are in hackamores (that means there isn't anything in their mouth)\n\nNext is the danger factor. Yes, this is dangerous. Yes, we were messing around. But lets think about this with some common sense. Someone mentioned that this strains their muscles. We'll, aside from the fact that they are trained to do this and have built up the muscles for it, have you noticed how far we are from land? Have you ever walked though water sweetheart? It warms you up. It warmed them up. The thing that is so great about the water is that it is a great workout for horses and many people use it for rehabilitation. Anyway, another person brought up flipping them over. These horses will only flip over if you keep making them go higher and higher and higher. They flip once they go past vertical. Thats why I fell off, because Kawya didn't have her footing right and she came up funny. If i had stayed on and kept queuing her to rear it would have put her in danger. \n\nAnyway, I guess what Christy and I want you to know is that we aren't some stupid chicks doing stupid things. We know what we're doing, we have been doing it for years. We just thought it would be fun to get a video to show y'all where our piece of paradise is.", "title": "Rear Off", "publishedDate": "2010-04-11T19:47:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "-lMpj5DUgro", "description": "A clip from the Article 5 Convention, held at Sirius/XM headquarters on April 9th, 2010, featuring Tony Blankley and Randy Barnett discussing how we make the changes from an Article 5 convention stick.", "title": "Article 5 Convention - Tony Blankley and Randy Barnett", "publishedDate": "2010-04-21T21:11:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "-lN0XgeAk6g", "description": "Catia V5 rendering of an Epicyclic gearing with propeller", "title": "Catia V5 rendering of an Epicyclic gearing with propeller", "publishedDate": "2014-02-19T13:59:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-lN8JiiMOFg", "description": "http://www.timetospa.com/bmr/muscle-toning/bmr-bottom-lift/\n\n\nLook even better walking away!

Get your peanut seeds (raw) from reliable dealer (OSC seeds has good reputation here in Ontario Canada).\n\n1a. I manage to find some at Chinatown, (raw peanuts), but it can get tricky to find the seeds which are mature enough for planting. So, if you are new gardener, and having difficulty determining which is a mature peanut seeds, order from your seed dealer. \n\nStep 2. \nGather your sterile seed planting medium\nI prefer peat pellets (see picture-less messy), plus guaranteed sterile. Pour some water, let it expand, then put your peanut seeds in the middle of the pellet. Does not matter which way is up, it will germinate. \n\nNOTE: peanut is tropical, so it needs lot of ligth and heat.  High germination rate at 90% requires minimum 6 hours light, and heat mat on. \nI tried no heat mat, and just light, germination rate is about 50%. \n\nSome gardeners use indoor seed soil, that is fine.  \n\nStep 3. Within one week, depending on your luck, the seeds will sprout. \nKeep the heat mat on, and 6 hours of light. By about 2 weeks,  transfer to a bigger pot, or in your garden depending on daily temperature.\n \nMake sure it is already warm, it is always around mid-June here in Ottawa, ON, Canada. \n\nNote: Peanut like to get dry between watering. Daily watering is not a good idea, unless its really really hot in July around 40C. \n\nSoil mix is 50% garden soil and 50% compost. No fertilizer was added in my peanuts. \n\n4. Watch it grow and make sure it gets lots of sun. Step 4. Watch them grow. Notice the \nyellow flowers, after it is pollinated, add 1-2 inches of soil at the base of \nthe plant for the roots to set in and form your ground nuts.

If you feel like you're part of any of these categories, let me tell you: I LOVE YOU, and I understand you, haha!! :D No, seriously, they were.. PERFECT!!!! \u2665 Before last episode, as much as I shipped them, I didn't feel like calling them an OTP like Olicity or CaptainSwan. Because, you know, those ships are so precious to me! But now.. Whatever happens for Westallen, I'll be right here for my new OTP \u2665\nThe roof scene was extraordinary! The chemistry, Barry, Iris, everything they said, and more importantly everything she said.. I cannot know for sure how writers will deal with ships in the future. All I know is, there is ONE TRUE LOVE in this show, and this one is Barry and Iris. No matter what happens, even if Caitlin and Barry happen at some point, the greatest love story is BARRY AND IRIS!! Seriously, you cannot write such scenes for a couple, and then throw it away. Westallen is actually more than a nice slow burn and beautiful words, this is a real connection between two people who love each other with all their hearts, who are willing to do anything for each other, because nothing is more important for them.. There are so many things that prove how strong and deep and pure their connection is, and I hope writers will keep up this way, because they're doing something great!! I know TV is mostly about business, and who knows which ship will be more popular in the end.. But I hope they'll keep in mind they have gold to write a great romance!! And writing should be more important than business. Just saying...\n\nAnyway, that was my very \"Westallen activist\" moment, haha!!! What can I say? I love them \u2665 I hope you guys will like this video ;)\nDon't forget to rate, comment and subscribe ;) I LOVE YOU ALL GUYS!!\n_____________________\n\nAlso, little note about my next Olicity video. It's still in the making, but thanks to your amazing comments on my preview video, I found inspiration to continue this video.

En esta ocasi\u00f3n aprenderemos 3 m\u00e9todos para sincronizar audio y video de una forma muy f\u00e1cil en Adobe Premiere Pro CC. Veamos que tal.\n\nAntes de iniciar me gustar\u00eda hablar sobre por qu\u00e9 la sincronizaci\u00f3n de audio y video es un proceso muy com\u00fan en la postproducci\u00f3n. Una de muchas  razones es porque actualmente la grabaci\u00f3n de video en c\u00e1maras dslr se ha popularizado, su calidad de imagen es muy buena, pero la calidad del micr\u00f3fono incorporado es p\u00e9sima, esto nos lleva a incorporar micr\u00f3fonos externos a nuestra c\u00e1mara, pero   el problema aqu\u00ed es que no todas las c\u00e1maras tienen entradas de audio para estos micr\u00f3fonos, as\u00ed que debemos capturar nuestro audio con una grabadora externa para despu\u00e9s sincronizarlo al video en postproducci\u00f3n. \n\nLa diferencia es muy notoria y aumenta mucho la calidad del audio de nuestros proyectos. Y bueno, ahora que sabemos por qu\u00e9 es tan importante la sincronizaci\u00f3n de audio y video, veamos c\u00f3mo podemos hacer esto en Adobe Premiere Pro CC.\n\nEmpecemos con el primer m\u00e9todo: La forma manual y m\u00e1s com\u00fan de sincronizar audio y video. Arrastramos nuestro clip de video a esta \u00e1rea para crear una nueva secuencia, agregamos el audio que fue grabado de forma externa, hacemos doble clic aqu\u00ed y sincronizamos tomando como referencia la forma de onda del audio de nuestros clips. Este m\u00e9todo es f\u00e1cil, pero es muy tedioso si tienes que hacerlo en una gran cantidad de clips.\n\nPara el segundo y tercer m\u00e9todo debemos tener una referencia sonora que est\u00e9 presente en los archivos que vayamos a sincronizar. En este caso yo hice un conteo y aplaud\u00ed dos veces. Ya teniendo mis clips grabados con sus respectivas referencias sonoras, vamos a iniciar con el segundo m\u00e9todo. \n\nAgregamos nuestros clips a nuestra l\u00ednea de tiempo y seleccionaremos ambos, hacemos clic secundario y nos vamos a la opci\u00f3n, syncronize, aqu\u00ed tomaremos como referencia el audio de nuestro primer canal, que en este caso es el audio de nuestra c\u00e1mara y haremos clic en ok. Una vez hecho la sincronizaci\u00f3n se har\u00e1 autom\u00e1ticamente gracias a la referencia sonora que tenemos presentes en ambos clips.\n\nEl tercer m\u00e9todo es el m\u00e1s pr\u00e1ctico de todos, de hecho es tan sencillo que no necesitaremos meter nuestros clips a la l\u00ednea de tiempo, simplemente en nuestro panel de proyecto seleccionaremos los clips que vayamos a sincronizar, haremos clic secundario y nos vamos a la opci\u00f3n de \"merge clips\" o en espa\u00f1ol \"combinar clips\". Aqu\u00ed seleccionaremos un punto de sincronizaci\u00f3n, que en este caso ser\u00e1 el audio que grabamos de forma externa y podremos de borrar el audio de nuestro clip de video que realmente no necesitamos. Hacemos clic en \"ok\" y un nuevo elemento aparecer\u00e1 en nuestro panel de proyecto, lo arrastramos a nuestra l\u00ednea de tiempo y veremos que el audio que grabamos de forma externa ahora est\u00e1 autom\u00e1ticamente sincronizado con nuestro video.\n\nY bueno, estos fueron los tres m\u00e9todos para sincronizar audio y video en Adobe Premiere Pro. Si te gust\u00f3 el video la mejor forma de demostrarlo es d\u00e1ndole like y compartiendo con alguien que le pueda interesar.

We have obtained most of our public records request with other parts forthcoming.  History teaches us that elections without public accountability are nothing more than vote-counting in the dark, controlled by a county government in the act of choosing itself and its cronies while picking our pockets. Our message is simple: \u201cWe the People\u201d must have elections that are 100% transparent, with a documented \u2018chain-of-custody\u2019 and then, the election must be verified! Nothing less! Government can never be the sole verifier of its own secret elections. \n\nIn light of the litigation it obvious that you were misled about our intentions. That lie (Short Video Clip\u2013 Santa Cruz I.T. Department Head Rafael testifies at BOS\u201d on why not to give SC Election Integrity Committee the Public Record) and what was told to you in \u2018executive session\u2019.  When all is said and done your acceptance of this fundamental lie could cost the county a substantial amount funds.  Sadly at the end, the taxpayers are the losers. \n\nAdditionally, from the records request we are reviewing we have found several problems that we would like to bring to your attention.   http://fatallyflawedelections.blogspot.com/2014/10/santa-cruz-fulfills-data-request-with.html \n\nReferring back to our letter of July 9, 2014, we are asking you to follow the law and give the candidates and public the due process that is their right under the law.  Yes, voting is a secret process; however counting is a public process.   It is our right under ARS 16-621 and other statutes to have observers in all processes where ballots are being handled. \n\nAs election observers we understand how important maintaining the integrity of the Chain of Custody is. Our citizen oversight access rights and Ballot Accounting is integral to maintaining the integrity of the ballot chain of custody. Under ARS 16-621 Proceedings at the counting center \u201cExcerpt from section A\u201d. \u2026and shall be conducted in accordance with the approved instructions and procedures manual provided for in section 16-452 under the observation of representatives of each political party and the public. The proceedings at the counting center may also be observed by up to three additional people representing a candidate for nonpartisan office, or representing a political committee in support of or in opposition to a ballot measure, proposition or question\u2026.   \n    By utilizing the existing election laws utilizing \u201cARS Title 16 \u2013 Elections and Electors and utilizing the Arizona Secretary of State Election Procedure Manual Revised 2014. Download the entire manual here  or link to specific pdf pages below in the manual.  As political party, candidates, and as electors, we invoke our rights to the following positions and ask be notified in writing before these boards meet.   Each of these boards shall consist of at least two members, and shall be registered voters of the parties on the ballots cast.    Each board\u2019s responsibilities shall be as provided in SOS manual:\n\u2022 Party & Citizens Observers            *      snag board                     \n\nAdditionally, I have been asked by Hess for Governor to serve as their appointed election observer in this county. Barry Hess will be on the ballot in Santa Cruz County during the upcoming general election.  Please let us know within 48 hours if I will be permitted to observe the proceedings at the counting center or entered into the observer's lottery pursuant to A.R.S. 16-621. Failure to so notify me may result in additional legal action.  \nYes, it is now 15 days before Election Day. We respectfully again ask that you open the process up. If you choose not to, you will be forcing us to file a Mandamus special action.  Fortunately for us, a mandamus action is designed to provide a fast-track process for cases that are relatively obvious. We are simply trying to get an elections department to follow state election laws (A.R.S. 16-621) and other statutes. \nIf we are forced to pursue a Writ of Mandamus our lead plaintiff will be Barry Hess Libertarian candidate for governor as well as other candidates up and down the Nov 4th ballot. \n\nPlease, we again ask to work together and build trust to remedy this mishandled situation. \n\nRespectfully yours,     John Roberts Brakey  Co founder; Americans United for Democracy Integrity and Transparency in Elections - AUDIT-AZ and Task Force Leader for Santa Cruz Election Integrity Committee \n\nFace Book [Santa Cruz EIC]   www.RiggedNoMore.com", "title": "Santa Cruz County BOS  Special Meeting on American United Court Case10 21 14", "publishedDate": "2014-10-22T02:30:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "-lmNi1yeyhE", "description": "By posting advertisements on their cars, the Sharjah-based company One Rent Car is able to rent cars for one dirham a day.", "title": "One Dirham car rental", "publishedDate": "2009-06-29T14:31:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ln-YZ2rC4E", "description": "The \"Big Tree\" as everyone refers to it, is located in the Sipsey Wilderness Area of the Bankhead National Forest in North Alabama.

According to tradition, the Atharvaveda was mainly composed by two groups of rishis known as the Atharvanas and the Angirasa, hence its oldest name is \u0100tharv\u0101\u1e45girasa. In the Late Vedic Gopatha Brahmana, it is attributed to the Bhrigu and Angirasa. Additionally, tradition ascribes parts to other rishis, such as Kau\u015bika, Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha and Ka\u015byapa. There are two surviving recensions (\u015b\u0101kh\u0101s), known as \u015aaunak\u012bya (AVS) and Paippal\u0101da (AVP).\n\nThe Atharvaveda, while undoubtedly belonging to the core Vedic corpus, in some ways represents an independent parallel tradition to that of the Rigveda and Yajurveda.\n\nThe Atharvaveda is less predominant than other Vedas, as it is little used in solemn (Shrauta) ritual. The largely silent Brahmin priest observes the procedures of the ritual and \"heals\" it with two mantras and pouring of ghee when a mistake occurs. An early text, its status has been ambiguous due to its ritualistic character.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Kerudung umumnya dipakai oleh wanita muslim.Tetapi kerudung juga sering dipakai oleh perempuan non muslim. Kerudung sendiri tidak dianjurkan dalam Islam, karena desain kerudung cuma sebagai penutup kepala saja. Kerudung yang hanya sebagai penutup kepala, tidak sepanjang khimar yang mampu menutupi dada wanita sekaligus. \n\nPerempuan Yahudi Ortodoks yang sudah menikah, misalnya, diwajibkan untuk menutupi rambut mereka, seringkali menggunakan kerudung yang dikenal dengan nama tiche atau snood, sesuai dengan aturan kesopanan tzniot. Kerudung dulunya dipakai juga oleh perempuan Kristen yang telah menikah di Eropa pada abad pertengahan, bahkan dipakai juga oleh perempuan yang belum menikah.\n\nHampir sama dengan kerudung, ada istilah khimar. Sesuai yang tertera dalam surat An-Nur ayat 31 Khimar  adalah apa yang dapat menutupi kepala, leher dan dada tanpa menutupi muka. Khimar merupakan pakaian atas atau penutup kepala. Desain pakaian ini yaitu menutupi kepala, leher dan menjulur hingga menutupi dada wanita dari belakang maupun dari depan (termasuk menutupi tulang selangka). Khimar ini tidak diikatkan ke leher seperti kerudung, karena jika hal tersebut dilakukan, maka akan memperjelas bentuk lekuk dada dari wanita. Jadi khimar harus menjulur lurus kebawah dari kepala ke seluruh dada tertutupi.\nHijab\nHijab menurut Al-Quran artinya penutup secara umum. Allah SWT. dalam surat Al Ahzabayat 58 memerintahkan kepada para sahabat Nabi SAW  waktu mereka meminta suatu barang pada istri Nabi SAW untuk memintanya dari balik hijab. Jadi, hijab brarti umum, bisa berupa tirai pembatas.\nSehingga memang terkadang kata hijab dimaksudkan untuk makna jilbab. Adapun makna lain dari hijab adalah sesuatu yang menutupi atau menghalangi dirinya. Hijab berasal dari kata hajaban yang artinya menutupi, dengan kata lain al-Hijab adalah benda yang menutupi sesuatu.\nJilbab\nSebagaimana disimpulkan oleh Al Qurthuby: \"Jilbab adalah pakaian yang menutupi seluruh tubuh\".

Our immune system has an important role in protecting us from infections. It normally recognizes bacteria, viruses and fungi by reacting to their proteins (antigens), but only under circumstances that present danger to our body such as tissue damage. In the absence of such \"danger signals\", foreign proteins are usually recognized as harmless and are tolerated. This process of immune tolerance occurs the first time our immune system comes in contact with these foreign proteins, such as when an infant ingests milk formula or breathes in pollens for the first time. However, if immune tolerance to a particular antigen fails to develop or is lost, the individual then becomes sensitized to this antigen and develops antibodies and specific T cells against it. An antigen that causes allergic sensitization is called an allergen. When the individual is exposed to this allergen again, an allergic reaction occurs.\n\nAllergic symptoms can be caused by different immunological mechanisms. The majority of allergic diseases are caused by either the Type I (or immediate-type) hypersensitivity response, or the Type IV (or delayed-type) hypersensitivity response.\n\nImmediate-type hypersensitivity reactions are caused by antibodies called IgE produced by the immune system against allergens such as pollens, house dust mites, mold spores, animal dander, insect venom, food or drugs. When the patient is exposed to these allergens, the IgE attached to allergy cells called mast cells binds to the allergens and trigger the mast cells to release chemical mediators such as histamine. This leads to swelling, itching, redness, congestion and airway constriction within a matter of minutes. Mast cells are mostly found in the skin, respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. IgE antibodies are involved in causing nasal and ocular allergy, asthma, insect sting allergy and some types of food allergy and drug allergy.\n\nDelayed-type hypersensitivity reactions are caused by a type of immune cells called T cells. Each T cell specifically recognizes one allergen, and when it is exposed to this allergen, it becomes active and produces chemical mediators that cause inflammation. This type of reaction usually occurs 24 to 72 hours after allergen exposure, and tends to become chronic. Certain types of food and drug allergy, contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis are caused by this type of reaction...", "title": "allergy cause, eczema cause, asthma cause, allergic rhinitis cause - CAAC", "publishedDate": "2013-03-06T08:46:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "-m267sSbUQ8", "description": "alluvium", "title": "ALLUVIUM FLAT-HEAD T.avi", "publishedDate": "2010-07-23T19:59:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "-m2LfDh-Hbw", "description": "An old chemist's in central Moscow has got back its historic look - thanks to local residents.\n\nThey collected 80-thousand roubles to restore a hundred-year-old paharmacy sign on Malaya Bronnaya Street - that's near Mayakovskaya metro.\n\nThe writing -- which had long been painted over -- was stumbled upon by chance.\n\nResidents then raised the money and paid students from a local art school to restore the sign.\n\nAfter two months of work, the sign was finally unveiled today ... with residents celebrating in the street.\n\nArchitectural activists now hope more people will become interested in crowd funding projects like this one.", "title": "Chemist's historic look revived by locals", "publishedDate": "2012-10-05T12:58:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-m2by0PfzVg", "description": "http://unleashingfruitfulness.com \nPaul writes about a third heaven, but what was he talking about?", "title": "What Is The Third Heaven?", "publishedDate": "2014-07-27T20:16:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "-m2dA4R-QIo", "description": "Leave a LIKE & COMMENT if you're going for this Recruitment Challenge!!\n\nCommentator - https://twitter.com/SynergyAntzro\nDesigner - https://twitter.com/SynergyJect\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nhttp://www.twitter.com/TeamSynergy_\nhttp://www.twitter.com/SynWZPA\nhttp://www.twitter.com/SynGalaxy\n\nWant to improve your gameplay?

This is the first time that the State of Israel has launched an international campaign of this kind.\n\nThe campaign premiered today (Thursday, 21 June 2012) at the Rio +20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development. The conference is the largest of its kind in the world, with approximately 50,000 participants. The State of Israel is being represented by an approximately 70-member delegation, with members from the Government, the private sector and the third sector, and is led by Environmental Protection Minister Gilad Erdan. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke today with Minister Erdan and thanked him for his Ministry's many activities to advance an environmental agenda and for placing the State of Israel at the forefront of green technology.\n\nIn the framework of the campaign, \"Green Israel\" promotional clips will be broadcast adjacent to weather updates on CNN International over the next two weeks. (Click here for a YouTube link.) The broadcasts emphasize the facts that Israel is a leader in environmental technology and that Israeli developments are in use all over the world. For example, Israel is a global leader in desalination with 40% of Israel's drinking water coming from desalination. Israel is also a global leader in the use of recycled water -- 70% of Israeli wastewater is recycled and used in agriculture after undergoing a special purification process.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu said, \"Israel is offering to the world the pioneering green technologies that it has developed. The goal of the campaign is to the show the world Israel's great abilities in the field of green technology.\"\n\nEnvironmental Protection Minister Erdan said, \"Israel has solutions for the challenges facing the world today, such as the shortages of food and water. The campaign raises the international awareness of Israel as a global leader in green innovation.\"\n\nThe Foreign Ministry notes that it is working to strengthen global agendas as a component of Israel's foreign policy and adds that this policy finds expression in greater involvement in conferences such as Rio + 20. Israel aspires to share its knowledge, experience, technology and innovations with the developing world in a spirit of friendship and good neighborliness, and as strategic policy tool pursuant to its foreign policy goals.", "title": "Green Israel Campaign on CNN", "publishedDate": "2012-06-21T14:53:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "-m4MC99_HwE", "description": "This harrier was doing its routine vertical climb out @ 1:27 you could hear the engine surging.

When individuals reject the validity of negative feedback, focus on their strengths and achievements but overlook their faults and failures, or take more responsibility for their group's work than they give to other members, they are protecting the ego from threat and injury. These cognitive and perceptual tendencies perpetuate illusions and error, but they also serve the self's need for esteem. \n\nMore Info:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias\nIf you know of more links with good infos please let us know in the comments and we'll add them here.\n\n\nCollaboration:\n\n- Script: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1z5uHcxU0jwkeeViFLYW2b41HZvVG93Q7IlBMG7jzwBg/edit?usp=sharing\n\n- Storyboard: \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_egT9CKjtz9NF95RjhTZEhQemc&usp=sharing\n\nPlease help us make this video better by collaborating on the scrip and storyboard.

The first commercially successful emerald synthesis process was that of Carroll Chatham, likely involving a lithium vanadate flux process, as Chatham's emeralds do not have any water and contain traces of vanadate, molybdenum and vanadium.[verification needed] The other large producer of flux emeralds was Pierre Gilson Sr., whose products have been on the market since 1964. Gilson's emeralds are usually grown on natural colorless beryl seeds, which are coated on both sides. Growth occurs at the rate of 1 mm per month, a typical seven-month growth run producing emerald crystals of 7 mm of thickness.[24] Gilson sold his production laboratory to a Japanese firm in the 1980s, but production has since ceased; so has Chatham's, after the 1989 San Francisco earthquake. source from - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald", "title": "Panna And Probal From Nature", "publishedDate": "2014-10-31T14:56:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "-m7jTG2K7Bk", "description": "A new drum and bass track from Gloam...", "title": "Gloam - SunRay (Drum and Bass)", "publishedDate": "2011-05-22T19:21:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "-m851xkWbLQ", "description": "On November 4, 2014 Bo Horvat made his NHL debut, appearing in his first regular season game with the Vancouver Canucks.

An example of this property is the shadow. If observed carefully, the edges of shadows are not solid, but slightly fuzzy.\n\nSo, what is going on? Diffraction can be easily explained with Huygens' Principle. Just as the front of a wave passes the edge of an object, the wavelets will cause the succeeding front to bend around the edge.\n\nFor some time, it was believed that the bending of light was not due to light itself, but the edge of the object. Not until the British Physicist, Thomas Young, conducted the double slit experiment before light was accepted as a wave.\n\nIn his experiment, he made two slits on a barrier and allowed monochromatic light (light of a single wavelength) to pass through. The result is a series of light and dark areas on the screen that could not be explained under the particle model of light. Under the wave model of light, these light and dark areas can be explained with constructive and destructive interference of waves.\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "Diffraction  of Light", "publishedDate": "2010-04-30T07:48:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "-mNRfNype4U", "description": "Defensive Evaluation Sept 10th 2010", "title": "Richard Ciufo, Team North Atlantic #15, 13u NTIS, Cary North Carolina, Sept 10-12, 2010", "publishedDate": "2010-09-13T13:57:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-mNYsNfdpKI", "description": "Gt Music Instrumentos musicais\ngtmusic@gtmusic.com.br\n(41) 3024 2166", "title": "Fernandes Guitar captador Sustainer - Review", "publishedDate": "2014-01-17T20:10:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "-mNf_77cjac", "description": "", "title": "Cod (Gadus morhua) in Iceland", "publishedDate": "2012-02-29T12:41:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-mNoRsN3PWo", "description": "", "title": "\u0436\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0438", "publishedDate": "2013-09-14T20:33:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "-mO3aTIhfMM", "description": "El presidente de Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, orden\u00f3 suspender los di\u00e1logos con las FARC por el secuestro del general Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Alzate.

(from DayZ Wiki)\n\nDayZ Standalone is the much hyped follow-up to the DayZ Mod created by infamous game developer Dean Rocket Hall. On 14 August 2012, Rocket announced that DayZ would become a standalone game that does not require Arma II. Development of the standalone version was headed up directly by Rocket, in conjunction with Bohemia Interactive, the publisher of ARMA II. With this announcement, Rocket turned the mod version of DayZ over to the community for continued development. Some of the main goals for creating the standalone were to fix bugs and prevent hacking, two things very difficult to do under the previous ARMA II architecture.\n\nDayZ Standalone utilizes the Take On Helicopter engine, which is a branch of the Arma II Operation Arrowhead engine Real Virtuality. The engine has been heavily modified even including code from ARMA III.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra Tags (ignore),\n\nlet's play dayz standalone, let's play day z standalone, lets play dayz standalone alpha, dayz standalone walkthrough, dayz walkthrough, dayz playthrough, dayz lets play, dayz let's play, DayZ Standalone Alpha, DayZ Standalone Alpha Gameplay, DayZ Standalone Gameplay, DayZ Standalone Gameplay 1080p, Dayz standalone alpha gameplay, day z standalone, day z standalone gameplay, let's play the dayz standalone alpha, dayz standalone alpha playthrough, dayz first look, dayz standalone first look, dayz standalone alpha first look, dayz standalone alpha released, dayz gameplay, dayz alpha gameplay, dayz standalone first impressions, DayZ Gameplay Alpha, dayz standalone game play, dayz standalone tips, dayz standalone tips and tricks, dayz standalone how to stop bleeding without a bandage, dayz standalone how to use the torch,\n\nFOLLOW ME: https://twitter.com/SGTTangoGaming", "title": "How to Stop Being Unconscious (Wake Up) (Fixed?) - DayZ Standalone Tips #4", "publishedDate": "2014-02-03T20:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-mfjC4bJGsY", "description": "Crass Records,1983.", "title": "OMEGA TRIBE- Profiteer", "publishedDate": "2009-07-02T15:30:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "-mgC4LxBswE", "description": "Raising the crown of a Quercus chrysolepis (canyon live oak) over a historic homestead cabin.

Sedang yang sudah berumur 3 tahun keatas sudah kurang produktif lagi. Untuk pembelian Lovebird sebaiknya kita ke tempat peternak yang sudah terkenal akan kualitas love bird yang dijualnya.\n\nCara Membedakan Love jantan dan Betina :\nCara yang paling mudah untuk membedakan antara love bird jantan dan love bird betina adalah dengan meneliti bagian cupit yang terletak di bawah anus LoveBird . Kemudian kita raba, apabila lancip ,rapat dan keras maka kemungkinan besar itu adalah pejantan sedangkan kalau capitnya tumpul, lebar, dan lembek maka itu adalah love bird betina. Ciri yang lainnya adalah LoveBird  Betina yang sedang Birahi akan mengumpulkanbahan bahan  sarangnya yang di selipkan di bawah sayapnya sebelum di bawa ke kotak sarangnya. kalau membedakan berdasarkan paruhnya, Lovebird kita ambil yang seumuran dan kita lihat kalau paruh dari pangkal sampai ujung cenderung meruncing maka itu love bird Jantan tetapi kalau paruh cenderung melebar berarti love bird Betina.\n\nCara Pemberian Pakan :\nPemberian pakan yang berkualitas juga akan berpengaruh terhadap keturunan Love bird, banyak jenis\npakan yang sering dipakai peternak adalah jagung muda, toge, sawi, kwaci karena pakan pakan tersebut bisa meningkatkan birahi Lovebird.\n\nCara Penempatan  LoveBird  di Kandang :\nDua cara beternak love bird yaitu dengan Kandang koloni atau individual sepasang dalam 1 Kandang. Kelemahan dengan sistem koloni adalah kita agak susah dalam melacak garis keturunan sedangkan secara individual maka kita lebih mudah melacak garis keturunannya. Kelebihan penempatan secara individual adalah lebih memudahkan kita bereksperimen untuk menemukan varian yang baru. Penempatan Lovebird adalah di Kandang kotak kayu dengan ukuran 80cm x 40cm x 40cm\n\nCara Persiapan Menjelang Reproduksi :\nYang harus disiapkan adalah kotak glodok untuk bertelor dan mengerami. tempat glodok umumnya di buat dengan kayu, sedangkan bahan sarang terbuat dari kulit jagung yang sudah dikeringkan. Telur love bird biasanya  berkisar 4-6 butir. masa mengerami Love Bird adalah selama 21 sampai 23 hari. setelah burung menetas induk jantan dan betina akan menyuapi anaknya secara bergantian. Sekitar umur 6 sampai 8 mingggu anakan mulai keluar dari sarangnya.setelah anakan Lovebird bisa makan sendiri maka ambil anakan love bird dan pisahkan dari induknya supaya induknya bisa kembali bereproduksi. Apabila indukan tidak mau  Meloloh atau menyuapi anaknya maka segera ambil anakan kemudian kita suapi sendiri. Pembuatan kotak untuk anakan adalah berukuran 40cm x 40cm x 40cm di lengkapi lampu bohlam 5 watt untuk menghangatkan anakan Lovebird. suapi anakan Lovebird setiap 2 jam sekali dengan bubur bayi SUN kacang hijau. tingkat kekentalan bubur di sesuaikan dengan umur anakan, semakin dewasa maka bubur yang kita berikan semakin kental. Setelah anakan berumur 3 atau 4 minggu kita mulai latih dengan memberikan makanan lain sperti buah-buahan, sayuran,  millet dan makanan lainnya.\n\nItulah Beberapa Cara Sukses Budidaya Burung Love Bird semoga bisa membantu anda memulai usaha baru dengan omset puluhan juta rupiah.", "title": "Lovebird Collection", "publishedDate": "2013-09-07T15:23:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "-mlOqKeCao0", "description": "I don't know what kind of mushroom these are.

But did you ever wonder, what\u2019s the role of a bass player? It\u2019s easier to define with guitar and piano/keyboard players for instance. They play chords throughout the song and then if needed they might take a solo. Simple. Learn chords, learn how to solo, job done!\n\nBut what about bass players!?\n\nWell, here\u2019s the deal. We have to do exactly the same thing. \n\nLet\u2019s get rid of the soloing part of the equation for now. That\u2019s for another day. Let\u2019s focus on \u201cthe chords\u201d\n\nSo as I stated above, guitarists and keyboardists will play the chords throughout a song. As bass players we must also represent the chords in the song, this is commonly known as \u201coutlining the chords\u201d, but instead of playing all the notes of the chord at once like a guitarist might do, we play the notes of the chord one at a time. \n\nBut how do we know the notes of each of the chords!?\n\nEasy, we learn our arpeggios. \n\nThe word arpeggio tends to make things sound a little more complicated than they are. All an arpeggio is, is a chord played one note at a time. So if you learn all your arpeggios, you\u2019ve learned all your chords! Essentially, you\u2019re ready to rock (or jazz, or country, or whatever else does it for you right now) ;)\n\nBut here\u2019s the gag. Learning and putting your arpeggios into use isn\u2019t easy, it takes practice and dedication to master all of the chord types over the entire fretboard. It should be one of your \u201cbig goals\u201d and when you master them it will give you endless possibilities of bass lines and solos. The arpeggios in my opinion are one of the most important things you can ever be working on, so I really recommend you work on these daily or at least when your practice schedule permits.\n\nI talk about the arpeggios (also know as chord tones) and why they are so important all of the time with the members of the SBL Academy. In fact, I they\u2019re probably sick of me saying it\u2026 \u201clearn your chord tones, learn your chord tones!\u201d I\u2019m like a broken record ;) \u2026 but I mean it. If you do this it will have a dramatic effect on your bass playing and overall musicianship in a big way.\n\nIn this guide I take a simple chord sequence and show you exactly how i\u2019m using arpeggios/chord tones to build my bass lines. I start super simple, just with root notes. I then start adding in the other elements of the arpeggios like 3rds and 5ths, and then finally introduce chromatic notes into the mix.\n\nThis lesson will give you a great insight into how to create bass lines using arpeggios and other devices such as chromatic passing tones.\n\nAs always, see you in the shed\u2026\n\nScott :)\n\nPS...

With broad, thick, glossy, ovate leaves, water hyacinth may rise above the surface of the water as much as 1 meter in height. The leaves are 10--20 cm across, and float above the water surface. They have long, spongy and bulbous stalks. The feathery, freely hanging roots are purple-black. An erect stalk supports a single spike of 8-15 conspicuously attractive flowers, mostly lavender to pink in colour with six petals. When not in bloom, water hyacinth may be mistaken for frog's-bit (Limnobium spongia).\n\nOne of the fastest growing plants known, water hyacinth reproduces primarily by way of runners or stolons, which eventually form daughter plants. Each plant can produce thousands of seeds each year, and these seeds can remain viable for more than 28 years.The common water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) are vigorous growers known to double their population in two weeks.\n\nThe Kerala backwaters are a chain of brackish lagoons and lakes lying parallel to the Arabian Sea coast (known as the Malabar Coast) of Kerala state in southern India. The network includes five large lakes linked by canals, both manmade and natural, fed by 38 rivers, and extending virtually half the length of Kerala state. The backwaters were formed by the action of waves and shore currents creating low barrier islands across the mouths of the many rivers flowing down from the Western Ghats range.\n\nThe Kerala Backwaters are a network of interconnected canals, rivers, lakes and inlets, a labyrinthine system formed by more than 900 km of waterways, and sometimes compared to the American Bayou. In the midst of this landscape there are a number of towns and cities, which serve as the starting and end points of backwater cruises. National Waterway No. 3 from Kollam to Kottapuram, covers a distance of 205 km and runs almost parallel to the coast line of southern Kerala facilitating both cargo movement and backwater tourism.\n\nThe backwaters have a unique ecosystem - freshwater from the rivers meets the seawater from the Arabian Sea. In certain areas, such as the Vembanad Kayal, where a barrage has been built near Kumarakom, salt water from the sea is prevented from entering the deep inside, keeping the fresh water intact. Such fresh water is extensively used for irrigation purposes.\n\nMany unique species of aquatic life including crabs, frogs and mudskippers, water birds such as terns, kingfishers, darters and cormorants, and animals such as otters and turtles live in and alongside the backwaters. Palm trees, pandanus shrubs, various leafy plants and bushes grow alongside the backwaters, providing a green hue to the surrounding landscape.\n\nVembanad Kayal is the largest of the lakes, covering an area of 200 km\u00b2, and bordered by Alappuzha (Alleppey), Kottayam, and Ernakulam districts. The port of Kochi (Cochin) is located at the lake's outlet to the Arabian Sea. Alleppey, \"Venice of the East\", has a large network of canals that meander through the town. Vembanad is India's longest lake.\n\nSource :- Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Go ahead and select any card that you'd like from the entire deck. Got it?\n\nAnn: Yes.\n\nJason: Memorize it and show it to the camera. Perfect. Go ahead and just place it right there on top and all I want you to do is cut the deck in half. Perfect and just complete the cut. Great. So now your card is lost in the deck. I don't know where it is. You don't know where it is. I'm going to try to just kind of sense out your card but, it doesn't always work quite the way I want it to, it's not going to happen. But, you know what? What's in a name? But I'll tell you what; I think your card might be a little bit more apt to try and find itself. I know that probably sounds weird but just bear with me. Could you tell me what your card was? \n\nAnn: It was a ten of hearts.\n\nJason: It was a ten of hearts? And that's the first time you've told me your card. I haven't seen it. You put it away in the deck?\n\nAnn: Yes.\n\nJason: T-E-N H-E-A-R-T-S. No. You know what? It's your card. I wonder if, maybe this would work better for you. Would you give it a shot?\n\nAnn: Sure. T-E-N H-E-A-R-T.\n\nJason: And flip it over for me.\n\nAnn: S. Crazy.\n\nJason: What's in a name? So this is another spelling trick. It's a great little effect and here's how this one works. First thing I have to do is I have to find her card. Now the way I find her card is really simple, it's just a key card, right? I use the bottom card, the nine of clubs in this case so that when she selects her card I already know the bottom card. She selects a card, take whichever one you want. Right? Show it to the camera. Place it right on top. Cut the deck in half. And when she completes the cut the nine of clubs ends up right on top of her card. So all I have to do is as I'm trying to sense her card, going through the deck, I know that her card is always going to be right below the key card. All I do is cut it to the top. Now it's a matter of finding it through its name. So I have her telling me the name as if I don't know the card yet. What's the name of the card?\n\nAnn: It's a six of...\n\nJason: A six of...\n\nAnn: Spades.\n\nJason: Spades. A six of spades? Are you sure?\n\nAnn: Six of clubs.\n\nJason: It's a six of clubs?\n\nAnn: Yes.\n\nJason: Great. It's a six of clubs. Not that I know. So what's your card again?\n\nAnn: Six of clubs.\n\nJason: Perfect. S-I-X C-L-U-B and S. And of course I know that's not it. But, by putting it right back on and actually placing the cards that I've just laid out here back on top of the deck, remember because I've been dealing them into a pile they're now in reversed order, her card is actually at the bottom of the pile because it was originally on top. \n\nSo I place it right back on so now all I have to do is justify her spelling out the card. And I do that just by reminding her; well of course I'm not going to be able to find your card. It's your card. It's bound to you. So why don't you try? We'll use a little bit of magic right? And all I want you to do is spell out your card.

Jets from eight nations and a NATO air-policing mission over Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were scrambled to intercept the Russian aircraft. \n\nNATO said eight Russian aircraft comprised of four TU-95 strategic bombers and four II-78 tanker aircraft, identified by Norwegian F-16 aircraft, were intercepted over the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe aircraft flew from mainland Russian over the Norwegian Sea, where six aircraft turned back and two TU-95 bombers headed southwest, prompting the UK to scramble Typhoon fighter jets. The two bombers then flew toward the Atlantic ocean, where Portuguese F-16s were scrambled. They then flew north to the west of UK afterwards.\n\nTwo Tu-95 bombers and two Su-27 fighter jets were detected flying over the Black Sea on Wednesday afternoon, where they were intercepted by Turkish fighter jets, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nTwo Russian MiG-31s, two Su-34s, one Su-27 and two Su-24 were also detected flying over the Baltic Sea in International airspace. Portugueses F-16 fighters were scrambled in response before the aircraft returned to Russian airspace, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nNATO said such flights pose a potential risk to civilian flights as the Russian planes often don\u2019t file flight plans or turn off their transponders, meaning civilian air-traffic control are unable to detect them, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

Costas, Mark Roybal, Scott Rudin, Nora Skinner\nScreenwriter: John Patrick Shanley\nFilm Description: When the principal (Meryl Streep) of a Bronx Catholic High School accuses a popular priest (Philip Seymour Hoffman) of pedophilia, a young nun caught in between the feuding pair becomes hopelessly swept up in the ensuing controversy. 1964, St. Nicholas, the Bronx: The winds of change are sweeping through this tight-knit religious community, and charismatic priest Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is doing his best to adapt by revisiting the school's notoriously strict disciplinary practices. Unfortunately Father Flynn's progressive ideas stand in stark contrast to the longstanding beliefs of Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), the iron-willed principal, who believes that an oppressive environment of punishment and fear is the only way to keep the student body in line. Suddenly into this tempestuous environment appears young Donald Miller, St. Nicholas' first black student. When hopeful innocent Sister James (Amy Adams) reluctantly reveals to Sister Beauvier that Father Flynn and Donald have been spending an unusual amount of time together in the church rectory, the unrelentingly righteous headmistress begins a merciless crusade to reveal the beloved clergyman as a lecherous child molester and have him permanently expunged from the school. Yet despite her moral certainty that Father Flynn has committed such an unspeakable transgression, Sister Beauvier has not a shred of actual evidence to back up her audacious claim. Now, as Sister Beauvier and Father Flynn enter into an epic battle of wills, the shock waves set into motion by their explosive confrontation threaten to destroy one man's reputation and tear apart the entire surrounding community. John Patrick Shanley adapted his own play for the screen under the guidance of producer Scott Rudin (The Queen, Notes on a Scandal).\n\ndoubt,\"doubt clip\",\"doubt trailer\",\"doubt and trust\",\"meryl streep\",\"philip seymour hoffman\",\"amy adams\",\"john patrick shanley\",\"window videos\",\"20th century period pieces\",drama,\"dramas based on the book\",\"period pieces\",\"religious spiritual dramas\",\"scott rudin\",\"celia d costas\",\"mark roybal\",\"nora skinner\",\"change videos\",\"dishonesty videos\",\"rejection videos\",\"monastery videos\",\"office videos\",\"school videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++396068,/m/0h0wc,/m/02qgqt,/m/0b25vg", "title": "Doubt (6/10) Movie CLIP - Pagan Christmas Songs (2008) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-01T06:00:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-nhEOyU_EEY", "description": "Dejen sus Likes :3\nApoyen a la hermandad!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/La.Hermandad.Gamer", "title": "El Templo Olvidado (Minecraft) Con Gymnogyps! parte 3/3", "publishedDate": "2012-05-24T06:02:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-nhNkH8mp3g", "description": "", "title": "\u010cSFD Review, agent Isherwood, Selfish Giant / Hodnocen\u00ed \u010cSFD, agent Isherwood, Sobeck\u00fd obr", "publishedDate": "2013-07-06T16:45:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "-nhpmXyD-oo", "description": "", "title": "air dock", "publishedDate": "2011-05-29T10:34:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-niYbdhiPfw", "description": "Silverweed - A member of the Rosaceae Family (Rose) with long runners, basal leaves and yellow flowers.

Abrams, Jason Katims, Nellie Nugiel, Meryl Poster, Paul Webster, Bob Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein\nScreenwriter: Jason Katims, Matt Reeves\nFilm Description: This dark comedy is a clever homage to classic generation gap comedies such as The Graduate (1967), The Last Picture Show (1971) and The Big Chill (1983), filtered through an ironic Generation X lens. Tom Thompson (David Schwimmer) is unemployed and aimless, hovering between childhood and adult responsibilities. A year out of college, Tom can't land a decent job -- he still lives with his mother in Brooklyn. He receives a call from Ruth Abernathy (Barbara Hershey), who informs Tom that her son Bill, Tom's best friend in high school, has killed himself. She wants Tom to deliver the eulogy and serve as a pallbearer, and flustered, Tom agrees, though he has no recollection of Bill. After delivering a lackluster eulogy, Tom meets the grieving Ruth and begins an impulsive affair with her. He also encounters Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), a beautiful classmate for whom he's long carried a torch. Although Julie at first mistakes Tom for someone else, they begin dating, while he keeps his relationship with Ruth a secret. First-time writer-director Matt Reeves work-shopped the script for The Pallbearer with writing partner Jason Katims at the Sundance Institute. Reeves went on to create the TV series Felicity.\n\n\"the pallbearer\",\"the pallbearer clip\",\"the pallbearer trailer\",\"the pallbearer part 1\",\"gwyneth paltrow\",\"toni collette\",\"barbara hershey\",\"michael rapaport\",\"david schwimmer\",\"bitty schram\",\"matt reeves\",\"independent comedies\",\"indie romance\",\"romantic comedies\",comedy,\"dark humor black comedies\",independent,romance,\"harvey weinstein\",\"bob weinstein\",\"paul webster\",\"meryl poster\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++135898,/m/016tbr,/m/0bq2g,/m/05myd2,/m/01_p6t,/m/052183,/m/03lvyj", "title": "The Pallbearer (2/10) Movie CLIP - Who Is Bill Abernathy?

So our award-winning engineers embarked on a two-year mission to create the ultimate in relaxation. We're proud to bring you the American Leather\u00ae Comfort Recliner\u2122 featuring a personal, infinite-position system that adjusts to your exact comfort needs. The Infinity System features a back and footrest that operate independent of each other and stop in any position, a fully adjustable headrest pillow and a height--adjustable base. All this is wrapped up in an elegant look that brings style to any room in your home. There are even three sizes to choose from and hundreds of fabrics and leather choices to complete your look. The American Leather Comfort Recliner is a recliner for people who take their relaxation seriously.\n\nFIND YOUR PERFECT POSITION.\nThe Infinity System offers unlimited ergonomic adjustability to support you where your body needs it most. The headrest moves up and down and also angles forward, so you can relax in cradled comfort. And, unlike most recliners, the back and footrest work independently and smoothly with infinite stopping positions. The adjustable swivel base allows you to set the chair at your perfect seat height.\n\nREST EVEN EASIER WITH OUR 10-YEAR WARRANTY.\nYou can buy with confidence knowing American Leather provides a ten-year warranty on the internal mechanism and a lifetime warranty on the frame of the Comfort Recliner. Your new best friend is also guaranteed to be free of defects in workmanship and materials for five years from the day you buy it. If a defect is found, we'll repair or replace the defective areas. With a little cleaning and care, you can expect to enjoy the beauty and comfort of your recliner for many years to come.\n\nSTRETCH OUT AND STAY A WHILE.\nThe Comfort Recliner's gas cylinder-assisted footrest smoothly stops in any position without clicking or ratcheting. Effortlessly pull the stainless steel Comfort Release\u2122 to raise the chaise-style ottoman to your desired position. In the open position, the chair has an elegant, stainless-steel footrest extension that hides all mechanical linkages and accentuates the full-length ottoman.\n\nCUSTOM COMFORT AND SUPPORT.\nNow you can lean back and relax without having to raise the ottoman thanks to the Comfort Recliner's independent back and footrest. When you recline, the weight-balanced mechanism moves with you, so you can lean back almost effortlessly; no need to push on the arms. If desired, the amount of resistance in the back can also be fine-tuned using two hidden tension knobs located beneath the chair. Go even further toward total comfort by rotating the recliner on the swivel base to adjust the overall seat height up to two inches.\n\nTHE PERFECT PILLOW.\nThe Comfort Recliner\u2122 headrest adjusts in two ways to get you to your perfect position. Find the ultimate movie-watching position by tilting the back of the headrest forward. And for complete head and neck support, an up and down movement adjusts the pillow height, all without any visible hardware for a clean, elegant look.\n\nEVEN THE SIZE IS CUSTOM.\nIn the quest for ultimate personalized comfort, one size does not fit all. Every Comfort Recliner\u2122 is available in three sizes to accommodate differences in height, weight and personal preferences. Try all three sizes and pick the perfect chair for you.\n\nCREATE YOUR PERFECT LOOK.\nLEATHER|American Leather brings you a wide range of leathers and colors to choose from. Our leathers are among the finest available: full aniline-dyed for beauty, softness, and a supple hand. Various finishes provide subtle sheens, thick pebble grain or smooth textures to fit perfectly with your d\u00e9cor.\nFABRIC|American Leather also offers hundreds of fabric options including the popular Ultrasuede\u00ae, velvets, boucl\u00e9s, linens, on--trend prints and more. All textiles are available on all styles.\nBASES|Walnut, Acorn or Espresso Wood Legs or Round Base, Upholstered or Stainless Steel Round Base.\n\nWHY CHOOSE AMERICAN LEATHER?\nAt the American Leather factory in Dallas, Texas there is a display hanging in the lobby that represents our values.

He believed in Ijtihad and embedded the modern concept of state and government with the Islamic thought and tradition. Pakistan is a proof of his Ijtihadi thinking.  His concept of nationalism is very original and innovative. Most of religions thinkers were against the creation of Pakistan. Here a nation is born first and its geographical boundaries and state created afterwards.  He believed that land belonged to God and there was no rationale for the existence of feudal. He believed in redistribution of state land to landless peasants. He visualized a polity which could cater to the needs of the oppressed and the exploited. Islamic state should give 5 fundamentals rights to citizens: Food, Clothing, House, Education and Medical facilities. These ideas were expressed by Dr. Javed Iqbal in a seminar arranged at University of Gujrat (UOG) in collaboration with Iqbal Academy Pakistan. Justice (r) Dr. Javed Iqbal chaired the function whereas Vice Chancellor UOG Prof Dr Mohammad Nizamuddin was the Chief Guest. Dr M. Sohail Umer, Director Iqbal Academy, Dr. Ejaz Akram Associate Professor from the faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities LUMS Lahore, and Dr. Tahir Hameed Tanoli, spoke on the occasion. \nProf Dr. Nizamuddin in his keynote address welcomed the speakers, guests and dwelled on the significance of the seminar. He termed Iqbal as a great world scholar and praised his encyclopedic knowledge and vision. But his vision stands unimplemented todate. His lectures \"Reconstruction of Islamic thought in Islam can be a locus for reforming our state. We need to deliberate on his political and socio-economic vision of an egalitarian state. Prof Dr. Ejaz Akram from LUMS talked in detail about the basic sources of Islamic jurisprudence and attributed God, the Quran, and the Holy Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) as the ultimate source of Islamic jurisprudence, Islamic polity and state. Mr. Sohail Umer from Iqbal Academy deplored the tendencies of anti-Ijtihad in certain dogmatic section of Muslims. He claimed that Iqbal believed in Ijtihad which had been in practice all along in the history of Islam. He believed that the creation of Pakistan is a testimony of Ijtihad as envisaged by Allama Iqbal. \nIn the second session Dr. Ejaz Akram presided and talked on Issue \"Iqbal, Democracy and Present Problems.\"  Mr. Khursheed Ahmad Nadeem opined that Iqbal believed in democracy and was in conformity with modernism. However his vision was a spiritual democracy which was propitious to the growth of a complete human being. It is the Mongols and Iranins embrace of Islam that perpetuated anti democratic and authoritarian ethos in Islam. Mr. Ammar Khan Nasir spoke on the need for a dialogue with the orthodox sections who were ignorant of the modern developments and Ijtihad in Islam which led to the creation of Pakistan.

It's estimated that the plutonium could be used to make between 40 and 50 nuclear weapons. The plutonium is currently kept at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency's fast critical assembly.\nJapan's government initially was reluctant to return the plutonium, saying it was needed for research on fast reactors. Now, however, sources say Tokyo has agreed to the request. The U.S. and Japan are expected to reveal a formal deal at next month's nuclear security summit in the Netherlands.\nHowever, the question of Japan's plutonium is deeper than arguments over the fate of those 330 kilograms. In addition to the plutonium provided by the U.S. decades ago, Japan also has about 44 tons of lower-quality plutonium, stored both in Japan and abroad. The excess reserves are due to Japan's policy of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. Rather than storing spent fuel, Japan reprocesses it to separate out plutonium for re-use. Japan is the only non-nuclear weapon state to do so.\nCurrently, even though Japan has shut down its nuclear reactors (and is not using plutonium), there are plans to open a new reprocessing plant at Rokkasho. According to a report by the International Panel of Fissile Materials, this new plant would separate out about 8 tons of plutonium each year\u2014enough \"to make one thousand Nagasaki-type bombs.\"\nNo one is quite sure what Japan will do with all that plutonium. After the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, Japan's nuclear reactors remain idle. Plutonium that would have been used for power generation thus sits unused, and the reprocessing plan would only add to the stockpile. The excess amounts of plutonium are causing regional worries over Japan's motives, as well as global concerns over the security of these nuclear fuel reserves.\nA symposium (co-sponsored by The Asahi Shimbun Co. and Princeton University) held in early January in Tokyo underlined regional concerns about Japan's plutonium. Steve Fetter, formerly the White House's assistant director on the Office of Science and Technology Policy, argued that Japan should not continue to accumulate plutonium without clear plans to use it for power generation. He pointed out that the growing stockpile of plutonium  suggests to other countries that Japan is effectively developing \"a type of nuclear deterrent\" without actually taking the step of building a bomb. Japan's actions could also encourage other countries in the region, including South Korea, to push back against the international pressure that killed their own nuclear fuel reprocessing programs.\nAt the same symposium, former Japanese foreign minister Yoriko Kawaguchi said that Japan would never take the step of developing nuclear weapons. \"Going nuclear would mean withdrawing from the NPT [Non-Proliferation Treaty] and facing international sanctions like North Korea and Iran,\" she said, adding that Japanese people would never support such a move.\nChina isn't convinced, unsurprisingly, as trust between Beijing and Tokyo is hitting rock bottom of late. In Monday's press conference, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying noted that \"China has grave concerns over Japan's possession of weapons-grade nuclear materials.\" Hua urged Japan to return the high-quality plutonium to the U.S. and to reassure the global community regarding its remaining reserves.\nChinese state media took up the issue as well, with a commentary in Xinhua Tuesday arguing that Tokyo \"owes\" the world an explanation for its stockpile of plutonium. The article opened by saying, \"If a country claims that it sticks by the three non-nuclear principles but at same time hoards far more nuclear materials than it needs, including a massive amount of weapon-grade plutonium, the world has good reason to ask why.\" The author also cited unnamed Japanese experts as saying that Japan could develop nuclear bombs within a year, given the presence of weapons-grade nuclear materials.\nThere is clear concern in China that Japan's plutonium reserves could eventually wind up being used to develop nuclear weapons. There's historical precedent for this\u2014India became a nuclear-armed state after using reprocessing to gain nuclear materials. For China, Japan's plutonium stockpile is one more piece of evidence that Shinzo Abe is seeking return to Japan's militaristic glory days.\nThis accumulation of plutonium also threatens global non-proliferation efforts, and thus runs directly counter to U.S. President Barack Obama's emphasis on nuclear security. \"We simply can't go on accumulating huge amounts of the very material, like separated plutonium, that we're trying to keep away from terrorists,\" he said in a 2012 speech at Hankuk University in Seoul.", "title": "JAPAN has Largest STOCKPILE of NUCLEAR GRADE PLUTONIUM - 45 TONS", "publishedDate": "2014-02-21T00:14:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "-oUPqmTbrxU", "description": "Jo\u00e3o Pedro Domenez explica Filosofia!
