If you want to know more about these plants you can visit us at Equilibriocarnivorousplants.com. One of the most common mistakes that people make with growing their carnivorous plants is watering them the wrong way. You want to make sure that when you\u9225\u6a99e watering them that the only type of water that you is either distilled water or rain water, any other type of water can kill these plants very quickly especially if there\u9225\u6a9a chlorine in them like you would get from your tap water. So one of the easiest ways to water your plants is just keeping them in standing water - like this tray here. We can put these plants directly in the water so that the soil is kept completely moist. Another way that you can water the plants is by misting them with distilled water of course. Nepenthes or your Tropical Pitcher plants love to be misted down; you also want to make sure that the pitchers are kept slightly full of water, about half way. Sometimes when you\u9225\u6a99e transporting these plants the water can be dumped out of the pitchers, the pitchers will quickly die if they\u9225\u6a99e not about half way full of water. These watering instructions apply to most carnivorous plant species like the North American Pitcher Plant, the Sundew and the Venus flytrap.\nPlantronics Voyager Pro Plus Sale | Plantain Smasher | Plantronics Voyager Pro Plus Ear Buds", "title": "Plantronics Voyager Pro Plus Sale | Plantain Smasher | Plantronics Voyager Pro Plus Ear Buds", "publishedDate": "2012-11-17T17:09:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6I8L7mkG8HM", "description": "Limbaugh Slams Sex Consent Policies: \u2018No Means Yes If You Know How To Spot It\u2019\n\n\n\nConservative host Rush Limbaugh on Monday suggested that sexual conduct policies stifled romance because sometimes \"no means yes if you know how to spot it.\"", "title": "Rush Limbaugh Slams Sex Consent Policies", "publishedDate": "2014-09-16T00:34:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "6I8O9U3HdOc", "description": "Ekrem OLGUN, Mekke Sorumlusu, 2013 Din G\u00f6revlileri Tecr\u00fcbe Umresi, Mihrab Crom Salonu", "title": "Ekrem OLGUN, Mekke Sorumlusu, 2013 Din G\u00f6revlileri Tecr\u00fcbe Umresi, Mihrab Crom Salonu", "publishedDate": "2013-06-01T15:01:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "6I95zJLOuI8", "description": "Rehearsal 09/07/2011", "title": "TANATOPRAXIA - Catarrh", "publishedDate": "2011-07-11T00:05:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "6I9K2osVS9w", "description": "Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Belediyesi ve \u00c7ek\u00fcl Vakf\u0131'n\u0131n birlikte ger\u00e7ekle\u015ftirdi\u011fi Yelde\u011firmeni Mahalle Canland\u0131rma Projesi'nin bir par\u00e7as\u0131 olarak d\u00fczenlenen Mural \n\u0130stanbul Etkinli\u011fi kapsam\u0131nda Yelde\u011firmeni'nde d\u00fcnyaca \u00fcnl\u00fc sokak ressamlar\u0131 taraf\u0131ndan duvar cepheleri boyan\u0131yor.", "title": "Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Belediyesi Muralist Yelde\u011firmeni Projesi Ahaber", "publishedDate": "2012-09-29T10:13:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "6I9p2mCBsgQ", "description": "Mehr \u00fcber Baccarat: http://www.casinospielen.de/baccarat.shtml\n\nWie spielt man Baccarat? Die meisten denken, es handelt sich bei Baccarat um ein furchtbar kompliziertes Spiel, dabei ist es sehr einfach und schnell zu lernen und eines der beliebtesten im Casino. Au\u00dferdem ist Baccarat perfekt f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger, und in diesem Video wollen wir euch zeigen, wieso.\n\nZwei Vorteile kristallisieren sich bei Baccarat heraus: zum Einen ist der Hausvorteil der Bank kleiner als etwa bei anderen Casinospielen. Zum anderen gibt es auch keine komplexen Strategien zu erlernen, sondern man kann sich einfach auf ein gewisses Ma\u00df an Gl\u00fcck verlassen.\n\nBaccarat: sehr einfach zu lernen\n\nZu Anfang des Spiels werden zwei H\u00e4nde ausgeteilt, einmal f\u00fcr den Spieler und einmal f\u00fcr die Bank. Der Spieler wettet nun, welche der zwei H\u00e4nde gewinnen wird. Der Gewinner ist immer die Hand, die als n\u00e4chstes an den Wert 9 heran kommt. \n\nIm Video werden wir euch zeigen, welche Karten welchen Wert haben und wie man in Praxisbeispielen an die 9 herankommt. Alle Endergebnisse liegen aber zwischen 0 und 9. Wird ein Wert erreicht, der h\u00f6her als 10 ist, so werden 10 abgezogen. \n\nBaccarat: auf gut Gl\u00fcck!\n\nDer Dealer \u00fcbernimmt die ganze Arbeit und man wettet nur darauf, welche Hand gewinnt. Anders als beim Blackjack muss man nicht sagen, ob man passt oder weitere Karten nimmt, sondern der Wert der aufgedeckten Karten bestimmt automatisch, ob noch eine weitere Karte hinzugelegt wird oder nicht. Im Video werden wir das genauer erl\u00e4utern.\n\nWie man sehen kann im Video: Baccarat ist ziemlich einfach. Als Spieler muss man nur wissen, wie man Wetten platziert, und schon ist man dabei im Spiel. Die Regeln daf\u00fcr, wann welche Karten gezogen werden und wann gepasst wird, werden zwar mit der Zeit komplexer. Aber darum muss man sich erstmal nicht k\u00fcmmern, denn das lernt man nach einigen Runden des aktiven Spiels.\n\n---\nHomepage - http://www.casinospielen.de/\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/CasinoSpielenDE\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/CasinoSpielenDE\nTumblr - http://casinospielende.tumblr.com/\nGoogle+ - https://www.google.de/+CasinospielenDe2002", "title": "Baccarat Regeln | Wie man richtig spielt - einfache Erkl\u00e4rung", "publishedDate": "2014-08-12T09:59:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IA-fzf0OeA", "description": "*\nGo To http://www.iROKING.com/bracket for FREE Nigerian Music\n\nBuy this track on iTunes (Bro Wale) - http://bit.ly/NtkwlN\n\nBuy the album \"Cupid Stories\" on iTunes - http://bit.ly/OxABXh\n\nHere comes another anticipated hit from the Ape Planet boys from their new ablum \" Cupid stories,It features 2face Idibia, Flavour, MI, Banky W,Phyno and Wizkid...keep on grooving to these beats\n\nFacebook - http://on.fb.me/Q6V2Pk\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/@itsiroking", "title": "Bracket  -  Bro Wale", "publishedDate": "2011-10-10T12:32:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IABvMae7ro", "description": "A caller says Christians don't run from atheists(they pray for us).

The diverse list of guitar stars that have taken variations of the SG model to heart over the years includes Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend, Angus Young, Frank Zappa, Derek Trucks, Tony Iommi, Robbie Krieger, Gary Louris of The Jayhawks, Rivers Cuomo of Weezer and many, many others. \n\nOriginally conceived as a modern replacement for the single-cutaway Les Paul Standard (the name it still carried for the first couple years of its existence), the SG had several features that made it perfect for cutting-edge guitarists -- all of which remain present in the Gibson USA SG Standard -- and it became an iconic rock guitar almost immediately. With its light yet resonant solid-mahogany body and neck, a radical looking double-cutaway design that also yields unprecedented upper-fret access, a rock-solid Tune-o-matic bridge and stoptail pairing, and two meaty humbucking pickups, today's SG Standard is just as sweet a player and as monstrous a tone machine as the guitars that made the name legendary nearly 50 years ago. \n\nCheck out the Gibson SG Standard: http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/SG/Gibson-USA/SG-Standard.aspx\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/GibsonGuitar\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/GibsonGuitar", "title": "Gibson SG Standard", "publishedDate": "2012-08-09T19:43:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IAphScPNes", "description": "a small stop motion animation I made with the action toy Naga Oyabun designed by Ashley wood.\nMusic : \" Loneliness is always around\" by Degiheugi", "title": "TK oyabun : Naga", "publishedDate": "2009-08-01T11:17:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IB0KEdPOns", "description": "Please visit us at  http://www.TreasureMountainMining.com to see this and over 2,000 more fine mineral specimens", "title": "3.8\" Bright shiny Red REALGAR Crystals on Orpiment Getchell Mine Nevada for sale", "publishedDate": "2013-07-15T13:09:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ICRIP35svs", "description": "", "title": "Skoponohmata - Tis Lampris.wmv", "publishedDate": "2010-04-28T20:26:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ICb4--iWTA", "description": "Brandon Barney for SecurityMetrics SecurityQ attempts to eat a hard shell taco in one bite.", "title": "How to eat a hard shell taco in one bite - TacoBell", "publishedDate": "2013-05-29T22:04:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ICeiVO0sAk", "description": "HAHAHAHHAA XDD\nla continuaciown XD\nimitando aaaa...\nHAHAHAHA XDDD\namonows sho lo shevo!!\nayy ayy ^O^ ke curadow XD\nme ahogoow o.o XD", "title": "tze tze tze (8) Parte 2", "publishedDate": "2008-08-02T21:47:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ICyTO0yo4c", "description": "Nakunan ng video ang isang traffic enforcer sa Davao City na pasimpleng tumanggap ng lagay mula sa hinuhuli niyang motorista.\n\nSubscribe to ABS-CBN News channel! - http://bit.ly/TheABSCBNNews\n\nWatch the full episodes of TV Patrol on TFC.TV  \nhttp://bit.ly/TVP-TFCTV\nand on IWANT.TV for Philippine viewers, click:\nhttp://bit.ly/TVP-IWANTV\n\nVisit our website at http://www.abs-cbnnews.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/abscbnNEWS\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/abscbnnews", "title": "'Tumatanggap' na traffic enforcer sa Davao, na-video-han", "publishedDate": "2014-11-18T15:04:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ID5mpBR4g4", "description": "Video aula de como por tala para orelha de yorkshire para deixar a tala emp\u00e9!", "title": "como por tala de orelha em yorkshire", "publishedDate": "2012-12-09T15:33:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ID9BrH6ebU", "description": "", "title": "Ang Sikreto Ni Hard HAHA Long Live S.B!", "publishedDate": "2013-03-16T11:06:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IDORb_XJNo", "description": "", "title": "Ibsen Rodriguez - En Lo Profundo De Ti", "publishedDate": "2012-06-28T22:52:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IE4-VJ1zFs", "description": "Furou o disco em tra lala.", "title": "O Tra la la la la la o", "publishedDate": "2011-11-16T12:37:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IEDiATCJJU", "description": "Anggota Fraksi Partai Demokrat Gede Pasek Suardika meminta Fraksi PDI Perjuangan tak terlalu mempersoalkan langkah Fraksi Demokrat yang memilih walkout dari sidang paripurna pengesahan RUU Pemilihan Kepala Daerah.\n\nOfficial Website: http://beritasatu.tv\n\nFacebook.com/BeritaSatuTV\nYoutube.com/BeritaSatu\n@BeritaSatuTV", "title": "Breaking News: Gede Pasek: PDIP Juga Sering Walkout", "publishedDate": "2014-09-25T18:55:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IELHPf2e1I", "description": "2013 Bachelor Tim Robards and Anna Heinrich chat to Briana on the red carpet.", "title": "'The Bachelor' Tim Robards & Anna Heinrich at the Dally M awards", "publishedDate": "2014-09-29T11:57:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IEXy83MapY", "description": "Want to know how top college football players reach elite status?

What scientists call a supervolcano. Now after hundreds of thousands of years lying dormant it threatens to erupt. This eruption could wipe out much of the United States killing millions. Suddenly, without warning, a small part of the caldera bursts. Temperatures plummet and the sky fills with dirty, black clouds of volcanic ash and destructive lightning. Lava erupts from the earth, boils over the crater rims, and rushes across the country side at speeds over 100 miles per hour vaporizing forests, animals, and tourists. As the rest of the caldera puffs and steams and threatens to explode, it's up to Yellowstone's top scientist and an adrenaline junkie Park Ranger to halt the erupting caldera. They must plug the lava, as well as stop the poisonous volcano clouds from spreading before the sky turns black and the entire world is frozen in a permanent, apocalyptic volcano winter.", "title": "SUPER ERUPTION", "publishedDate": "2011-07-07T18:42:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IJli-e83rk", "description": "Mood Altering formed by 4 recovering addicts from Rumah Cemara rehabilitation center,\n(RE-edit), i made this video in 2009.\nBig Respect!!", "title": "Mood Altering - TUAN", "publishedDate": "2013-09-09T04:12:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IK-VHP-WR0", "description": "", "title": "ASCLEPIUS MEDICAL RESEARCH DOT MEDICAL EXAM", "publishedDate": "2014-07-01T18:14:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IKXKWPN07w", "description": "epicyclic geared steam engine made from scrap material", "title": "epicyclic geared model steam engine", "publishedDate": "2013-10-16T16:38:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IL54xfY0Gw", "description": "", "title": "Bebe MC, Dragoman, Like Star, Cinder, Vitto - Cumbiaton (Party Remix) (Prod.

When her husband (David Duchovny) was killed, Audrey Burke (Halle Berry) didn't think she would be able to summon the strength to carry on. Jerry Sunborne (Benicio Del Toro) is a heroin addict who was one of the recently deceased's oldest friends in life, but as a result of his addiction Jerry has lost everything that ever mattered to him.

Consisting of three islands just 480 miles south of Miami, Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac, and Little Cayman remain our little piece of paradise.\n\nGovernment \nThe Cayman Islands highest official is the Governor, His Excellency, Mr. Duncan Taylor, CBE, who is the appointed representative of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. He presides over Cabinet, the ruling body of the country. Mr. Taylor succeeded Mr. Stuart Jack, CVO. The Governor's term is four years. The existing constitution of the Cayman Islands, introduced on August 22, 1972, provides for the government of the Cayman Islands as a British Overseas Territory. It established a governing body called the Cabinet, which consists of three officials and five elected members, the latter being selected from the 15 elected representatives of the Legislative Assembly. To see the 15 elected representatives or to get more information visit the Cayman Islands Government website.\n\nCurrency \nThe Cayman Islands has its own currency, first issued in 1972, whose basic unit is the dollar, issued in notes with denominations of CI$100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 and coins valued at 25 cents, 10, 5 and 1 cent. The CI dollar has a fixed exchange rate with the US dollar of CI$1.00 equals US$1.25. Or, the US dollar equals CI $.80. There is no need for visitors to exchange their US dollars into local currency. The US dollar is accepted throughout the islands at a rate of CI 80 cents. However, this can be confusing to visitors: for example, a US$20 note becomes CI$16. Banks do NOT give a better rate of exchange! Major credit cards (with the exception of the Discover Card) and traveller's checks are widely accepted. Canadian dollars, Euro dollars and pounds sterling can be exchanged for CI dollars at local banks. In addition, Automatic Teller Machines accepting VISA and MasterCard with Cirrus affiliation are located at Cayman National Bank and other banks and at Owen Roberts International Airport as well as a few other locations such as the grocery stores. \n\nGeography\nThe total land mass of the three islands is 100 square miles. Grand Cayman occupies 76 square miles; Cayman Brac, 14 square miles and Little Cayman, 10 square miles. Grand Cayman is approximately 22 miles long and 8 miles at its widest point, reaching a maximum elevation of 79.77 feet in North Side.\n\nCayman Brac is 14 miles long and 2 miles wide and has the most dramatic topography of the trio. Its majestic Bluff rises west to east along the length of the island to 151.75 above Spot Bay. Many mysterious caves are carved throughout this awe-inspiring natural attraction.\n\nLittle Cayman, only 10 miles long and a mile wide, is flat, reaching a maximum elevation of 55.75 ft. Its famous Bloody Bay wall Marine Park has been called one of the world's best dive sites. Inland, the 203 - acre Booby Pond Nature Reserve is a RAMSAR site and nesting ground for the Caribbean's largest population of Red Footed Boobies. \n\nCayman Islands Department of Tourism  http://www.caymanislands.ky\n\nEmail Unravel Travel TV bookings@unraveltravel.eu\n\nUnravel Travel TV http://www.unraveltravel.eu\nUnravel Travel TV Twitter http://www.twitter.com/UnravelTravelTV\nUnravel Travel TV on You Tube http://www.youtube.com/UnravelTravelTV\n\nJane Wilson, Unravel Travel TV, London Office email: jane@unraveltravel.eu", "title": "Cayman Islands Department of Tourism - Unravel Travel TV", "publishedDate": "2011-12-23T21:32:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IUNr7b5vOI", "description": "", "title": "Rissole Collie R32 skid out the back", "publishedDate": "2010-02-18T11:24:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IUSrhB3izc", "description": "This video is part of the Basic Nuclear Physics module of the NSEP portal.", "title": "Basic Nuclear Physics: Atomic Structure with Captions", "publishedDate": "2012-11-16T21:48:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IU_AMKikio", "description": "CLICK LINK FOR FREE BOTTLE: http://tinyurl.com/YourRaspberryKetone\n\n\nRaspberry ketone drops is a supplement that promises fast weight loss results. It is different from other supplements in the sense that it contains raspberry ketone, a metabolite compound that is extracted from red raspberries, and that it comes in liquid form. The contribution of the compound to weight loss is that it speeds up metabolism, and this means more fat in the body is burned in a shorter period of time. Moreover, the fact that it comes in liquid form means that it is absorbed by the body three times faster than those supplements that come in pill or capsule form.\n\nRaspberry ketone drops is indeed a promising weight loss supplement. But, how does it really work and why does its efficacy vary from one person to another? It promotes weight loss because it regulates adiponectin, a hormone that speeds up metabolism. It also helps people control their food cravings by increasing their leptin sensitivity. Moreover, adding to its weight loss value is that almost none of the nutrients it contains is wasted. To be more specific, it is stated in the Physician's Desk Reference that up to 98 percent of the nutrients found in supplements that come in liquid form are absorbed by the body in 22 to 30 seconds. The main reason for this is that liquid supplements do not have binders and fillers, as opposed to pills, that delay absorption.\n\nBut, if raspberry ketone drops is such an efficient supplement, then why does it not work for everybody?\n\nWell, that is the thing supplements that are known to work very well. People would start expecting it to perform miracles and think that the moment they take it, their weight issues are solved. Just because they spend money on a supplement does not necessarily mean that they can just sit down and let it do all the work. They should not forget that there is no such thing as a miracle supplement, only one that makes losing weight easier for them. It is added to complete a whole, and that is what raspberry ketone drops is about. People's attitude towards losing weight is still one of the most important factors in the success of their weight loss efforts.\n\nTake charge of your health and body.

Ribes grossularia), is a species of Ribes (which also includes the currants). It is native to Europe, northwestern Africa, west, south and southeast Asia. Gooseberry bushes produce an edible fruit and are grown on both a commercial and domestic basis.\n\nAlthough usually placed as a subgenus within Ribes, a few taxonomists treat Grossularia as a separate genus, although hybrids between gooseberry and blackcurrant (e.g., the jostaberry) are possible. The subgenus Grossularia differs somewhat from currants, chiefly in their spiny stems, and in that their flowers grow one to three together on short stems, not in racemes. It is one of several similar species in the subgenus Grossularia; for the other related species.\n\nThe gooseberry is a straggling bush growing to 1--3 metres (3--10 feet) tall, the branches being thickly set with sharp spines, standing out singly or in diverging tufts of two or three from the bases of the short spurs or lateral leaf shoots. The bell-shaped flowers are produced, singly or in pairs, from the groups of rounded, deeply crenated 3 or 5 lobed leaves. The fruit of wild gooseberries is smaller than in the cultivated varieties, but is often of good flavour; it is generally hairy, but in one variety smooth, constituting the R. uva-crispa of writers; berries' colour is usually green, but there are red variants and occasionally deep purple berries occur.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Many of men were left homeless; huts and tents burned and torn to leave their families no place to hide. There was the squall of young children that permeated the rustling of women as they tried to find retreat near the Nile, hoping to follow it until they were ways away from the attack. Husbands were left behind to fend for their land. \n\n\"General?\" \n\n\"Search every dwelling. Leave no one behind.\"\n\nAnd my men did. Sitting high on my steed, I watched as they scoured through the small village. In no time at all, the remaining villagers were tied to a lengthy rope and led back to Ciaro\u2014Egypt's capital. There were men, women, and children of all sorts. Many of which will be set free to their land again, others would be trained and forced to serve in the Army. \n\nWe needed strong men; men ample enough to fight. The sick surely wouldn't do, neither would the women and children, but we would need a handful of servants. They would tend to us in the upcoming years as we reigned over the Egyptian Empire. \n\n--\nCairo, Egypt\n\n1889\n\nIt had been long since we departed Egypt. Their men proved well and strong as we fought many battles along the way. Their women appeased our sexual appetites, serving us limb to limb until they were tired and withered. Now, I was on my return to Cairo and the air buzzed with my upcoming arrival. \n\nIt was early dawn when my ship docked in Cairo. Many were still deep into their slumber, enjoying the cool morning air as they dreamt of all the riches in the world. \n\n\"Sir?\" bowed a dockhand, \"We've been expecting your arrival. We've accommodated a steed for you.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nIt appeared our initial trip had left quite an impression among the citizens. Fear of what we could do and wouldn't do for them must have remained embedded in them. The dockhand, a man perhaps in his early twenties, moved around me, grabbing the only bag I packed. He gave me another bow before leading me towards my mount. \n\n\"General?\" another man spoke through the dimness of the night. \"It's a pleasure seeing you again.\"\n\n\"Richard,\" I bowed my head slightly, \"I am happy to see you are alive and well.\"\n\n\"Indeed. The people of Egypt have accepted me quite graciously, I must say.\"\n\n\"We were sure to treat them well as long as they obeyed us,\" I smiled softly.\n\n\"I was surprised to hear of your return. What business brings you back to Cairo?\"\n\nShaking my head as I mounted my steed, I smiled, \"No business at all. This time I've come for mere leisure. I must admit I've missed the passion of my wonderful Egyptian women.\"\n\n\"Indeed. Indeed,\" Richard smirked, \"I will say I've become a happier man here.\"\n\n\"I wish to be as fortunate as you,\" a grin formed on my face as Richard mounted his horse.\n\nMounted and ready, we rode off, following the guiding torch of the men before us. Richard spoke to me of his position in the palace as British Ambassador. He slept within the safe walls of the palace, usually accompanied by a lustrous woman or two. Within the year of our return to Britain, the Egyptian Empire thrived once again. Colors of vibrant reds and greens were brought back to the people with a grand festival that signified their freedom once again. The festival carried on until sunrise the following morning until the people were fallen from their drunken greed or sheer exhaustion. \n\nSome time later, we arrived at the palace gates, passing through as two men pulled open the heavy, gold embellished doors. We dismounted and were followed by a slave hand as he carried my bag to my awaiting room. \n\n\"Thank the King for his hospitality,\" I nodded at Richard, who nodded in return. \n\n\"I will leave you to yourself, General. I hope the accommodations are to your liking.\"\n\nWith that, both men left me as I found my way to the large featherbed smothered with rich colors of large pillows. I fell onto them, quickly engulfing myself in what little sleep I could manage. \n\nI mustn't sleep long before a light yet insistent knocking came from my door. Groaning in my irritation, I beckoned the person forward. It was a young girl, possibly not even twenty in age, dressed in a white frock made of thin cotton. It was nearly translucent against her tanned skin. In her hands, she carried a tray with an assortment of fruits and bread. With her eyes still lowered, she kneeled beside me, holding the tray for me to pick to my liking. \n\n\"Are you going to feed me, sweetheart?\" I smirked coyly, tilting her chin up with my finger. \n\nHer grey eyes flashed up at me, curtained with long, sultry lashes. \"If that is your wish, sir,\" she replied softly.", "title": "Golden Harem - 1", "publishedDate": "2011-01-19T22:53:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IshmWu_P1A", "description": "MUSKA IN HIP-HOP, TO JE TO KR ZDRU\u017dUJE ME,\nUSAKA SEKUNDA BITA MADGRAJUJE ME,\nNO\u010cEM BIT \u0160E EN MUDEL IZ ULCE K PRUPADU JE,\nNISM TIP \u010cLOVEKA DA BI FOLK S PRSO NAME KAZU PA GOVORU,\n\"lejga k se spet zakadu je\"\nTE SEKUNDE BITA ME ODPELJEJO NA DRUGO STRAN,\nDA POKA\u017dEM FOLKU BORBO,MO\u010c IN KAKO FURA SE IZ DNEVA V DAN,\nYO SKOZ BOLE\u010cINO, YO SKOZ SOVZE,SKOZ SMEH IN SKOZ LJUBEZEN,\nSKOZ OZPONE,YO SKOZ PADCE IN SKOZ BOLEZEN,\nPA SE LAJF \u0160E ZMERI GURA DALJE,\nCILJ U LAJFU DELA\u0160 IZ NULE,DO VRHA VELKE SO RAZDALJE\nUSAKI\u010c K NA VRHU SI,LUBUSUMN FOLK TE ZBIJE DOL,\nNEKI MA\u0160 KAR ONI NE, TEMU PRAVM SAM OBOL,\nPUST TE PAPKE NA TEJ POTI MJHNA SO PREPREKA,\nFLOW SE ZLIVA GOR PO BITU KOKR ZLIVA SE MI REKA,\nIN NEBOM POPU\u0160\u010cU,NE MORTE MENE ZBIT,\nZA HIP HOP STUJIM ZATO NE MI PAMETI SOLIT,\nDOBRE RIME BOM UDPEU\nROKA V KATERI BO POMO\u010c, Z VESELJEM BOM SPREJEV\nSUDELVOV RD BI Z MNOGIMI MC-IJI,\nPA MI PRAVJO NE PRBIJI,\nFRENDI PRAVJO \u010cE TI USPE SE NE PREDEJ,\nVELIK BO PADCOV SAM TI HOD NAPREJ,\nOB USAKMU ZVOKU BITA ME ZMRAZI,\nFILING RIME SE U MEN ZBUDI,\nBIU SM \u017dE NA POTI, DA BI S TEM ZAKLU\u010cU, \nPA SM VIDU KVA NA SCENI SE DOGAJA,\nGLAVNE TEME V KOMADIH, PI\u010cKE IN DROGE PA PREPRODAJA,\nMLADE FANTE SE V DILERJE VZGAJA, VIDU KOK JIH DRU\u017dBA SPREMENI,\nU\u010cASIH BLI PRJATLI, DONC SOVRA\u017dNIKI....!", "title": "Sandi - Muska&Hip Hop!", "publishedDate": "2012-07-13T13:08:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "6IsiwI9HqgY", "description": "Klay Thompson finished the preseason with an exclamation point leading the Golden State Warriors with 35 points to a 119 - 112 victory over the Nuggets.\n\nAbout the NBA: \nThe NBA is the premier professional basketball league in the United States and Canada.

Food is an integral part of the holiday and is used to symbolize the hope for a sweet, fruitful new year.\n\n\nStep 1: Bake challah bread\nBake challah bread. Dissolve 1 package dry yeast and 2 tablespoons of sugar in 1/2 cup warm water until the yeast begins to foam. Combine 5 1/2 cups flour, 1 cup water, 1/4 cup oil, 2 eggs, and teaspoon salt in a food processor, gradually adding the flour.\n\nStep 2: Cover dough\nPut the dough in a greased bowl, cover and let it rise for one hour. Knead the dough and shape it into circular roll, then let it rise again. Glaze with one additional egg and then bake on a cookie sheet at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 30-40 minutes.\n\nTip\nIn its round form, the challah represents the cycle of life and the passing year. It is passed around the table so everyone can break off a piece.\n\nStep 3: Slice up apples\nUse a knife to slice up a selection of apples. Serve with individual dishes of honey for dipping.\n\nTip\nAfter an apple slice is dipped in honey, the blessing for eating tree fruits is recited. After the apple is tasted, the apples and honey prayer is recited.\n\nStep 4: Offer fish\nOffer a fish dish, which symbolizes the hope that the coming year will bring plenty. Place any whitefish fillets -- such as snapper, trout, haddock or sole -- in a baking dish.\n\nStep 5: Season the fillets\nSprinkle the fillets with salt and pepper, apple cider or red wine vinegar, olive oil, and a dash of honey. Garnish with raisins if desired. Bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes or until the fish is no longer translucent.\n\nStep 6: Serve new fruits\nServe new fruits, such as pomegranates. A new fruit means one that has just come into season, recently picked. Tradition holds that a pomegranate contains 613 seeds, just as there are 613 of God's commandments.\n\nStep 7: Make carrot tzimmes\nMake tzimmes, a savory, sweet carrot side dish. Peel and slice 12 carrots. Melt 3 tablesoons butter in a saucepan, then add 3 tablespoons honey, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, and 3 tablespoons lemon juice. Add the sliced carrots and bring the mixture to a boil. Simmer for 1 hour on low heat.

It is considered the premier competition in alpine ski racing together with the quadrennial Olympic Winter Games and the biennial FIS Alpine World Ski Championships. Some experts event consider winning the World Cup to be athletically a more valuable title than winning gold at the Olympic Winter Games or the World Championships, since it requires a competitor to ski at an extremely high level in several events throughout the season, and not just in one race. Today, the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup races are held primarily at famous ski resorts in the European Alps, along with regular stops in Scandinavia, North America, and Far East Asia. Competitors attempt to score a maximum of points during the season in five events: slalom, giant slalom, super-G, downhill and super combined. The fifth event, super-combined, was introduced in 2005 and generally consists of a shorter downhill race and a one-run slalom. Sometimes the downhill is replaced by a super-G.  Alpine was added to the Olympic winter schedule in 1936.\n\nFor further information about FIS Alpine visit: \n http://www.fis-ski.com/alpine-skiing/\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fisalpine\n\nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/fisalpine", "title": "Kristoffersen shines on the Levi Black | Audi FIS Ski World Cup Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-11-16T14:03:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "6J0nys4Iupk", "description": "PLAB2: How to test for the GCS and neurological examination", "title": "SAMSONPLAB- EXAMINATION OF AN UNCONSCIOUS PATIENT", "publishedDate": "2012-08-20T23:09:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6J1-eYBbspA", "description": "Music video by David Archuleta performing Crush.

A late-term abortion using Caesarean section procedures is termed a hysterotomy abortion and is very rarely performed. The first modern Caesarean section was performed by German gynecologist Ferdinand Adolf Kehrer in 1881.\n\nA Caesarean section is usually performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby's or mother's life or health at risk, although in recent times it has also been performed upon request for childbirths that could otherwise have been natural. In recent years the rate has risen to a record level of 46% in China and to levels of 25% and above in many Asian, European and Latin American countries. In 2007, in the United States, the Caesarean section rate was 31.8%. Across Europe, there are significant differences between countries: in Italy the Caesarean section rate is 40%, while in the Nordic countries it is only 14%. Medical professional policy makers find that elective cesarean can be harmful to the fetus and neonate without benefit to the mother, and have established strict guidelines for non-medically indicated cesarean before 39 weeks.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Amazing animals.\n\nSea turtles, along with other turtles and tortoises, are part of the order Testudines.\n\nThe seven living species of sea turtles are: flatback sea turtle, green sea turtle, hawksbill sea turtle, Kemp's ridley sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, loggerhead sea turtle and olive ridley sea turtle.[3] All species except the leatherback are in the family Cheloniidae. The leatherback belongs to the family Dermochelyidae and is its only member.\n\nThe species are primarily distinguished by their anatomy: for instance, the prefrontal scales on the head, the number of and shape of scutes on the carapace, and the type of inframarginal scutes on the plastron. The leatherback is the only sea turtle that does not have a hard shell; instead, it bears a mosaic of bony plates beneath its leathery skin. It is the largest sea turtle, measuring 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m) in length at maturity, and 3 to 5 feet (0.91 to 1.5 m) in width, weighing up to 1,300 pounds (590 kg). Other species are smaller, being mostly 2 to 4 feet (0.61 to 1.2 m) and proportionally narrower.\n\nExplore More:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_turtle", "title": "Scuba Diving with a Sea Turtle on the Great Barrier Reef", "publishedDate": "2010-01-28T09:41:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "6JQ0ifSjgAE", "description": "Musica instrumental", "title": "La Orquesta de Glenn Miller - MOONLIGHT SERENADE ( SERENATA A LA LUZ DE LA LUNA )   ( sin video )", "publishedDate": "2009-09-07T04:11:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "6JQ7hu3PYVM", "description": "Sara Evans performs \"Suds In The Bucket\" live at the Grand Ole Opry during GAC's Opry Live.

Most people rest the weight of the putter on the ground while they align the golf ball with the target and just prior to taking the putter away during the back swing, they grip the putter more tightly which usually changes the alignment of the putters face with the target and results in the golf ball being hit off the target line and missing the putt.

Or was it a tip-stall or unintentional snap-roll into the ground?\n\nThe position of the ailerons and the corresponding roll direction and roll rate are the evidence here.\n\nTo me it looks like the pilot had full control authority of the wings throughout the whole incident.

I've seen them growing in England, the Canary Islands, Mexico and in many different places here in the US.  These plants are so versatile because they can comfortably fit into many styles of gardens from old fashioned cottage right up to modern simplistic.  They grow well here in California where our Mediterranean climate suits them to a tee and they are loved because they have a long bloom time.  Their non thirsty ways just plain make sense given our lack of rainfall for the last 3 years.\n\nI was a professional gardener in the San Francisco Bay Area for over 15 years. This is where I first learned all about perennial salvias. The nursery where I worked in Berkeley sold many different species and varieties of them.  This post is all about sharing what I know about pruning the two most popular types of perennial salvias which you probably have in your own garden.  \n\nHere's the link so you can read the rest of the post & get all my tips for Pruning Perennial Salvias: http://www.joyusgarden.com/prune-perennial-salvias/\n----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------\nJOY US GARDEN\ngardening, gardens, crafting & creating. let's make the world a more beautiful place!\nwe sell tillandsias too - be sure to check them out on our website.\nhttp://www.joyusgarden.com\n\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/JoyUsGarden\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/JoyUsGarden\npinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/JoyUsGarden/\n----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad-----------------------------------------------------------", "title": "Pruning Perennial Salvias", "publishedDate": "2014-04-25T14:27:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Jd6QnehwB0", "description": "", "title": "Interview Gitte Snellen", "publishedDate": "2012-03-02T16:57:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "6JdSn_h9hEw", "description": "House animation made in Autodesk Maya.\n\nTime of rendering : 30 hs aprox...\n\nFor more check my pages: \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PDEProducciones\n\nhttp://pedro8999.deviantart.com/", "title": "Colonial House Paint Effects Animation ( Maya )", "publishedDate": "2013-11-30T03:20:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "6JdXkxBuK5Y", "description": "BGM : Space Time - beatmania iidx 18 resort anthem\n\nMP3 : http://www.mediafire.com/?g758uahahmntx06", "title": "Equestrian Time", "publishedDate": "2012-06-09T02:12:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "6JeTUm57zec", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/wethepeoplebook - Take a walk through the most sellingest Glock store in the country, aptly called the GlockStore.

These essential oils in various parts of plants do not only help plant to be against microbes but also protect human from infection against bacteria, fungi and virus. The project is called AAA, Anti Bacterial, Anti Fungal and Anti Viral.\nThe 5-year AAA experiments project also found that while infected, human tends to have inflammation symptoms in skin and/or internal organs and tissues. NMRCC contributes its effort in the second health project - Anti Inflammation (AI). From NMRCC's point of view, inflammation is similar to an \"alert effect\" and is not a disease. However, if the immune system attacks normal tissues and cells abnormally, it may result in various serious diseases. These over-reacted serious symptoms are called AID, \"auto immune diseases\". NMRCC's human experiments are aiming at the relief against AID. NMRCC named the project \"AIR - Auto Immune Relief\".\n\nAroma Medicine Products (AMPs)\nNMRCC invented hundreds of AMPs for anti inflammation and auto immune diseases relief ( AI and AIR). They include oil, toner, serum, cream and lotion with different combination of essential oils in different concentration. Most frequently used AI/AIR products are also AAA . They includes:\nGH/P52/P60/P80/G1/G3/G5/G6/G7/G10/G12 AI/AIR Oil\nP10/P25/P30/P50/G1/G3/G5 AI/AIR Toner\nP50/P68/G1/G3 AI/AIR Serum\nP25/P36/GH/P70/G1/G2/G3/G5/G6/G7/G10 AI/AIR Cream\nP25/P36/P50/G1/G1H/ G2/G3/G5/G6/G7/G8H Lotion\nGH/G1/G2/G3/G5/G10/G20 Water Base Essential Oil (WBSE)\nG100 AI/AIR Essential Oil and Lymph Detox Essential Oil\n\nStress Relief Aroma Medicine\nNMRCC found out that human especially females get auto immune diseases partly because of stress & anxiety which are rarely found in other animals. Aroma Massage using Stress Relief (SR) aroma products seems to provide excellent result in mind healing which results in decreasing in brain beta wave and gamma wave. In the meantime, alpha wave (feeling relaxed), theta wave and gamma wave may increase (feeling sleepy). This seems to help the normalization of immune system and to reduce inflammation on skin and internal organs/tissues/moving cells.\nAfter thousands of experiments, NMRCC carefully selects AI essential oils which are also SR. About 30 essential oils are frequently used in NMRCC experiments and AMPs for Stress Relief Massage (SRM). Using Stress Relief Aroma Medicine Products for massage is called Aroma Stress Relief Massage.\n\nMore suggestion\nNMRCC suggests clients/patients to eat the right foods following 10GEN suggestion (10 Groups of Essential Nutrition) during LDM experiments.", "title": "NMMT ATAF SRLDM Lymph Detox Massage Pelvis E307DB", "publishedDate": "2014-03-06T19:28:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "6JiVoEreWdY", "description": "See Oregon Soccer's reactions as they move into their new locker room", "title": "Oregon Soccer moves into new Facility", "publishedDate": "2012-08-03T22:00:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "6JiyGkqnls4", "description": "Eine himmlische Version des Titels \"Helden\" von Radio Doria aus dem Album \"Die freie Stimme der Schlaflosigkeit\"", "title": "Jan Josef Liefers und Ina M\u00fcller - Helden (von Radio Doria)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T20:04:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Jj9B0ugB2I", "description": "Symptoms of ectopic pregnancies.

And it has a spacious 20 x 56 inch running surface. This treadmill also features a powerful, 2.75 hp motor. It has a multicolored LCD console that lets you track your time, calories, distance, speed and more.\n\nThe touch keys on the console are large and easy to use so you can easily start or stop your workout, or adjust the speed or incline as you work out. It also comes with a number of different workout programs. There are two heart rate programs, two customized user programs and 17 preset programs -- 5 for weight management, 5 for healthy living, and 7 for sports training.\n\nAnother great feature is the audio center that has built-in speakers and also a headphone plug in Jack. There is also a USB port so you can plug in a USB storage device to save your exercise data and upload it online to your LifeSpan fitness club account.\n\nWhen researching this treadmill we found over 60 customer reviews online and the reviews are very strong. This treadmill received an average user rating of 4.5 out of a possible 5 stars.\n\nOne review came from a person who said they had been spoiled by commercial quality treadmills over the past 10 years but they were now looking for a treadmill they could use at home. This person had never heard of LifeSpan before but after using the TR3000i he said that it's about as close to commercial quality as you can get without spending at least $2500. He said that although it's not quite to the same level as the lifestyle treadmills at his local gym, it is as good or better than the treadmills he has used in hotel gyms over the years.\n\nOne drawback that some people pointed out was that this particular treadmill is heavy. Because it's heavy it can be difficult to set up and if you want to move it at some point in the future, you're probably going to need some help. \n\nThis is also a folding treadmill so you're supposed to be able to fold it up and put it away when you need extra space but the extra weight of this treadmill makes that difficult to do.\n\nHowever, other customers see the heft of this treadmill as a benefit. It is very sturdy and doesn't slide around while you're running on it. In fact, it doesn't budge one little bit.\n\nThere really weren't very many negative reviews online at all. Most people had nothing but positive things to say. Most customers agree that the LifeSpan Fitness TR3000i Folding Treadmill is very well built and easy to use. The console is large and is positioned in such a way that it's easy to use the buttons and read the screen.\n\nMany customers also commented on how quiet this machine is when they're using it. Many customers said that the LifeSpan Fitness TR3000i Folding Treadmill is the sturdiest, best built, and highest quality treadmill in its price range.\n\nAfter researching this product and studying all of the customer reviews we could find online, we would certainly give this treadmill our recommendation.\n\nThis product review was originally posted here:\nhttp://learning2lose.com/lifespan-fitness-tr3000i-folding-treadmill-review/", "title": "LifeSpan Fitness TR3000i Folding Treadmill Review", "publishedDate": "2014-07-12T04:36:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "6JmKGEEI5Vw", "description": "Cartoon about Germany\u00b4s way to the World Cup Trophy! \nJustCartoons on FB: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Just-Cartoons/1415758075328417?ref=hl\n\nAnd for everyone who want to support our work, you can buy our song on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/album/id887913597\nAnd Amazon: http://tinyurl.com/q9zbozw\n\nLyrics:\n\nTomorrow I can be broke\nAll alone, maybe get a stroke\n\nGet in trouble anyway\nBut nothing can bring me down today\n\n'Cause life is a game, the game you schould play\nTomorrow we can lose, but not today!\n\nWe are living for today, we jump and shout\nWe scream out loud, loud as never, all together\nNo one can take that away\nWe are living for today!\n\nLive to win, born to lose\nWe don't have a lot to choose\n\nBut we choose our way\nWe are living, living for today!\n\n\nWe are living for today, we jump and shout\nWe scream out loud, loud as never, all together\nCome on and join us on our way\nWe are living for today!", "title": "Die Mannschaft - Full CARTOON Movie  ;)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-16T17:47:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "6JmzWnApuxI", "description": "The World's  Clark Boyd visited the kitchen of a famous Belgian frites shop in Antwerp, Belgium.", "title": "The World: Belgian Frites at Fritkot Max", "publishedDate": "2011-07-18T16:08:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "6JnA8hLtdKo", "description": "Subscribe to our gaming channel - https://www.youtube.com/user/ZionMainframeGaming\n\nWelcome to CarBS!

The processor was the AdrenaLinn III using the 1966 Marshall \"Plexi\" amp model and some chorus.  To add interest to the progression, I made an attempt to modulate down a whole step after the first progression completed.\n\nThere is a vocoder kind of thing at the end that contains a top secret conspiracy theory type message.   Actually, it is a reference to a book written by G. Edward Griffin and published in 1994 which presented what seems to be the exact script they are currently using in the economic/political arena today unfortunately.  \n\nTo create the vocoder effect (I need to get the vocals in the mix higher next time) I used Sonar and inserted the Pentagon I soft synth as an effect on a vocal track.

But it was quite like day 3.\n\n***\nMy tips for getting through post-op week one:\n\n1. Stay on top of your pain meds and ahead of the pain, even if you're not a big medication-taking person. This will make a world of difference and get you through the worst of it with minimal to tolerable pain.\n\n2. Sit and sleep in a recliner or otherwise propped up. You'll want the support for your shoulder. In addition to borrowing a recliner for the living room, I bought one of these zero-gravity bed wedges: http://j.mp/OhhYEO I attribute actually getting rest this first night (and subsequent ones) to this! Totally worth it!\n\n3. Stay hydrated! \n\n4. Eat nutrient-rich foods to give your body what it needs to heal. The cocktail of meds will likely throw off your insides, especially your digestive system, so nourishing your body (with the right foods and plenty of water) is as important as ever. (In addition to eating a well-balanced vegan diet, I'm also drinking at least one serving per day of vanilla chai Vega One, a plant-based protein shake: http://j.mp/NOkjv1) \n\n***\nAbout my surgery: I was originally going to have an SLAP tear repair surgery (hence my mentioning it in my earlier, night-before video). But when he went in, my surgeon found more than he was expecting. My rotator cuff was torn, there was a ton of scar tissue, and my bicep tendon had attached itself to the cuff. He had to detach the two, plus fix the tear. The surgery was twice as long (2 hours) as it was supposed to be, and my recovery will be, too.\n\nMy experience and recovery are atypical. If you're having a straightforward rotator cuff repair (or even rotator cuff + SLAP tear repair), I think, given my own research, your recovery will be a bit different from mine. Typically, you're not quite as immobilized as I am required to be. You can carefully remove your sling a day or two post-op for passive exercises, and you can start PT much earlier. Granted, every surgeon will have slightly different rehab instructions. Be sure to follow your doctor's to a tee!\n\nSurgeon: Dr. Warren Strudwick http://j.mp/MCd9K1\n\nMedications: \n1-2 Norco every 8 hours as needed for pain (10 mg hydrocodone bitartrate and 325 mg acetaminophen per pill)\n1 Naprosyn 500 mg twice daily (for inflammation)\n1 Vistaril 25 mg twice daily as needed (for nausea)", "title": "Rotator Cuff Surgery Recovery: Day 5", "publishedDate": "2012-07-24T03:10:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "6K4ZGVvNtag", "description": "The tragic accident at Sydney's Eastern Creek Raceway that took the life of Todd Wilkes aka The Judge and his twin turbo v8 Giocattolo crash into the wall at the end of the straight", "title": "Todd Wilkes aka The Judge Fatal Car Crash in twin turbo v8 Giacatollo at Eastern Creek", "publishedDate": "2014-08-21T15:42:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6K5GWE0TWGc", "description": "i will have an video tommorow too nothing special ! i will also have and video tuesday not thursday i have an wedding to attend thanks\ntwitter:https://twitter.com/handyhammy17", "title": "strawberrys natural cage tour", "publishedDate": "2014-06-19T20:50:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "6K5bmxlD-ug", "description": "\"Esta m\u00fasica faz parte do DVD e CD VillaMix 3, dispon\u00edvel em todas as lojas.\n\nCompre agora o CD e DVD: http://som.li/1s6fSBI\nBaixe agora o CD VillaMix 3 no iTunes: http://som.li/QPPprb\nOu\u00e7a agora na Deezer: http://som.li/S0PwR3\"", "title": "Gusttavo Lima - Garrafa Pet - (Villa Mix Festival Goi\u00e2nia 3\u00b0 Edi\u00e7\u00e3o) - [Clipe Oficial]", "publishedDate": "2014-06-11T20:19:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6K699rCVzoY", "description": "Don Francisco - Bodega Bamz feat.

This is an important segment, and the stance for the left uppercut wants to be, you want to have a little bit of a longer of a stance, because what we're going to do when we throw the shot is we're going to have to lean over just a little bit, to deliver that left uppercut right to the jawline, which is going to be your sweet spot.  So let's work the left uppercut.  All right, so Terry is going to lean ever so slightly, with a little bit of pivot, just a hair, all right, and he is going to rip his uppercut right through and catch my chin, all right, so watch the way this works.  He leans and catches the sweet spot, game over.\n\nNow I'm going to show you the Mexican uppercut.  The Mexican uppercut is also delivered with the left hand.  Why?  Because my liver is on the right side, and Terry being an orthodox fighter, that's the hand he's going to get his liver shot with, all right?  Same principle, he leans over and packs the liver shot up 45 degrees to the back of my spine, and he rips it through.  One more time, he leans, pivots, and rips.  Do that one more time and pivot the back foot just a little bit more.  Ready?  Over, and rip it through.  Beautiful, and as you can see, there's no pivot with the front foot, just the snap, a snap of a hit, leave that heel on the ground, so if you want to follow through with your hook punch, you can at will.", "title": "How to Throw a Left Uppercut | Boxing Lessons", "publishedDate": "2012-11-11T02:05:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "6KQ2cQtbJFo", "description": "El inspector Rolando Trinidad habla sobre la balacera en la que murieron una feligr\u00e9s y un hombre en Caimito.

Such qualities are the main reason as to why they attract certain types of birds such as woodpeckers, blue birds, wrens and cardinals.\nThe feeders are available in different sizes and shapes. A simple wire basket is the most common style; the basket is specifically designed to hold suet cakes that are produced commercially.\nStyles of suet feeders\nThe double suet cake feeder\nThe basket is made with a wire and it is covered with a metallic roof that serves to protect the birds from harsh weather conditions such as snow and rain. The roof also shades the birds from the sun.\nThe recycled double suet cake bird feeder\nThe feeder can be able to hold two suet cakes and it is made from milk jugs that have been recycled. The feeder also houses a paddle at the bottom which helps birds such as the Pileated woodpeckers balance while they feed since they are large tree clinging birds.\nThe recycled upside down suet feeder\nIt is designed such that birds can cling to the bottom when feeding. Birds such as nuthatches, wrens and woodpeckers do not have any problem feeding upside down. Since rodents such as squirrels will have difficulties feeding in this manner the bird's food remains protected.\nSquirrel proof feeding station bird feeder\nJust as the name suggests this bird feeder is designed to keep the bird food away from squirrels through Haven guard fencing. The design features an open wire bottom that prevents the seeds from building up. It can hold two suet cakes and 1-1/2 lbs of seeds. It also has a four metal seed ports, metal squirrel lock and a metallic basket.\nMany backyard birds such as chickadees, woodpeckers, junkos, flickers, mocking birds, nuthatches, sapsuckers, brown creepers and more are attracted to suet bird feeders.\n\nVisit us at http://mybirdfeeder.org/", "title": "Suet Bird Feeder", "publishedDate": "2013-02-08T15:26:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "6KUm8Hrzeqw", "description": "TV Kopernikus-\"Gladna sam rodnog neba\"", "title": "Dule Rajkovic Idemo sine", "publishedDate": "2009-05-20T02:50:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "6KVND_PzzRs", "description": "Many people don\u2019t realize I ALMOST played for the Colts this season.

There's a reason for that, and a solution!  Watch this video for both...\n\nMany seat patterns require that a listing be sewn to the foam in the insert while not creating a visible sewn line on the surface of the seat.  To create this effect, the listing must be sewn to the foam, then pleats sewn into both the foam and surface material at once.  This process shows up usually on later models like Malibus or Grand Nationals, but is necessary on some earlier models as well.  This is the only way to manufacture these patterns, so we want you to have this video as a quick guide to make your restoration easier.", "title": "Installation Tips - Upholstery Listings", "publishedDate": "2009-12-17T15:47:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "6KhvS_7_W7g", "description": "iMPC Pro tightly integrates with MPC Element for a super portable, smooth beatmaking experience.\n\nAnd yes, MPC Fly works too!\n\niMPC Pro Log showcases the latest features from the freshest development build of iMPC Pro,\u00a0the upcoming beat production iPad app from Akai Professional and Retronyms.

Hemophobia - fear of blood\n. Agoraphobia - fear of crowds or being in a crowded public space\n. Athagoraphobia - fear of abandonment\n. Proditiophobia - fear of betrayal\n.

The stages of living between these events: childhood, adolescence, adulthood, parenthood and senior are themselves natural and in accord with the needs of the species and most individuals. Many find their satisfaction in living this course and to these individuals I have little or nothing to say. Others though long for something more; something innate, genetic and seemingly calling. Adventure and change can give a degree of satisfaction and relief yet even these may seem too tame. To those who feel drawn to something beyond the entertainment and stimulation of senses I offer a walk along The Path of Wildness. Don't bother penciling the event in your schedule, preparing a pack with goodies and supplies or even inviting a friend along, for this experience is along the course of your first inclination and you must surely always go alone.\n\nLearn more about The Path of Wildness here:\nhttp://wp.me/P5A2F-As\n\n====\n\nCHANNEL CREDITS\n\n\"Japanese Falls\" image by the artist Lane Brown.

He composed it in Leipzig for the Sunday Estomihi, the last Sunday before Lent, and probably first performed it on 27 February 1729.\n\nBach wrote the cantata in Leipzig for Estomihi. The Sunday, also called Quinquagesima, is the last Sunday before Lent, a period when Leipzig observed tempus clausum and no cantatas were performed. In 1723 Bach had performed two cantatas on the Sunday, Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn, BWV 23, composed earlier in K\u00f6then, and Jesus nahm zu sich die Zw\u00f6lfe, BWV 22, audition pieces to apply for the post of Thomaskantor in Leipzig. In 1729 the cantata was the last one performed on a Sunday before the St Matthew Passion on Good Friday of that year. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, \"praise of love\" (1 Corinthians 13:1--13), and from the Gospel of Luke, healing the blind near Jericho (Luke 18:31--43). The gospel includes Jesus announcing his suffering in Jerusalem. Whereas Bach's former cantatas also considered the healing, this work concentrates on the view of the Passion.\n \nThe text was written by Picander, who also wrote the text for the St Matthew Passion, and was published in his Jahrgang of 1728, therefore a first performance in 1729 seems likely. The poet concentrates on the announcement of suffering, which is regarded as tremendous (movement 1), as an example to follow (2), as a reason to say farewell to earthly pleasures (3), finally as a reason to give thanks (4, 5). In movement 2 the poet comments the recitative by stanza 6 of Paul Gerhardt's hymn O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden, which appears in the St Matthew Passion in this and four other stanzas. The beginning of movement 4, Es ist vollbracht (\"It is finished\" or \"It is fulfilled\", (John 19:30), appears literally in the Gospel of John as one of the Sayings of Jesus on the cross, and is foreshadowed in the Sunday's Gospel (Luke 18:31).[1] Bach's St John Passion contains an alto aria on these words, as a summary immediately after the death of Jesus. The closing chorale is the last of 33 stanzas of Paul Stockmann's \"Jesu Leiden, Pein und Tod\" (1633).\n\nMovement 1 is a dialogue of Jesus and the Soul. The soul is sung by the alto, Jesus by the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ). Bach achieves dramatic contrast, setting the words of Jesus as an arioso, accompanied by the continuo, the Soul's answers as a recitativo accompagnato, accompanied by the strings. The instrumentation is opposite to the treatment in the St Matthew Passion, where the words of Jesus are accompanied by the \"halo\" of a string quartet. The word \"Sehet\" (literally: see!) is expressed in a long melisma, the move toward Jerusalem in an upward scale. The text is repeated several times, accenting different words to present different aspects of its meaning. In movement 2, the expressive melodic lines of the alto are commented by the chorale on the melody of Befiehl du deine Wege. The cantata culminates in movement 4, the vox Christi reflecting the completion of the Passion, Es ist vollbracht. The oboe introduces a meditative motifs which the bass picks up, both resting on sustained strings. The middle section illustrates the words \"Nun will ich eilen\" (\"Now I will hasten\") in runs of the voice, oboe and violin. A quasi da capo resumes the first motif on the words \"Welt, gute Nacht\" (\"World, good night\"). The closing chorale is a four-part setting.\n\nAlthough the cantata was scored for alto, tenor, and bass soloists, a four-part choir only for the chorale, oboe, two violins, viola and basso continuo including bassoon, I created this arrangement for Solo Concert (Pedal) Harp.", "title": "Aria: \"SIch folge dir nach -- Ich will hier bei dir stehen\" (BWV 159 No 2) for Harp", "publishedDate": "2014-07-31T13:34:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "6L3fqy0REJU", "description": "Extravagance SL at Trance in D\u00fcsseldorf Volume 6\n\nBOOKINGS:\nbooking@musicandartist.com\n\nWEBSITE:\nwww.extravagancesl.com/\n\nREMIX INQUIRIES:\ninfo@extravagancesl.com\n\nFOLLOW US ON TWITTER:\ntwitter.com/ExtravaganceSL\n\nSUBSCRIBE OUR YOUTUBE:\nwww.youtube.com/user/Extravaga...\n\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK:\nwww.facebook.com/ExtravaganceSL", "title": "Extravagance SL @ Trance in D\u00fcsseldorf Vol.6", "publishedDate": "2014-04-13T09:26:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "6L3opwbpVxk", "description": "Learn French - The accents", "title": "Learn French pronunciation - The accents", "publishedDate": "2012-06-04T12:04:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6L3r0_mR1z8", "description": "See the Solarmonkey on our website:\nhttp://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/powertraveller-solarmonkey-adventurer-solar-charger-a8110031\nThe SolarMonkey is a powerful solar charger with an internal battery.

Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals,while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi. Fertilization is the fusion of both sex cell or gamete.Copulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for insemination and subsequent internal fertilization. Mating may also lead to external fertilization, as seen in amphibians, fishes and plants. For the majority of species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. However, for some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not required because the parent organism is capable of self-fertilization (autogamy); for example, banana slugs.\nFor animals, mating strategies include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of mating and artificially inseminating domesticated animals is part of animal husbandry.", "title": "Donkey Horse Mating Documentary 19", "publishedDate": "2014-09-01T06:59:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6LAhBbCsszE", "description": "An investigation into whether Australia's unemployed are the worst off in the world.

Here's more from our correspondent.\n\nHeinz von Holzen is an awarding chef who has lived in Bali for over two decades. Married to a Balinese woman, he owns a villa resort and restaurant and helps promote Balinese culture. Heinz organizes cooking classes showcasing traditional Balinese food and has surprising words about the tourists in Bali.\n\n[Heinz von Holzen, Chef and Entrepreneur]:\n\"Probably 99% of the people who come to Bali will end up never ever trying a Balinese meal. Everyone who comes to Bali associates Balinese food with four dishes: nasi goreng, mi goreng, sate, gado gado. None of the four dishes is Balinese. Nasi goreng, although it is perceived as Indonesia's most famous dish, is not even Indonesian, it is Chinese. Nasi means rice, goreng means fried, fried rice is Chinese. History of nasi gorgeng dates over 3000 years back to ancient China.\"\n\nIn the early 90's, Heinz came to Bali as an executive chef at the Grand Hyatt Hotel. As a newcomer he was faced with challenges living in Bali, but now local chefs come and ask him how to cook traditional Balinese dishes.\n\n[Heinz von Holzen, Chef and Entrepreneur]:\n\"When I came to Bali there was no literature, there were no books, no recipes and where do I start?\"Things were difficult at first but...\n\n[Heinz von Holzen, Chef and Entrepreneur]:\n\"Then meeting my wife, being able to take part in ceremonies and with the chefs I mean all our chefs were Balinese (...) I got a fantastic chance to actually look into the culture and then I found out, hey taste this food, it tastes delicious.\"\n\nHe opened a restaurant and later a villa resort inspired by Balinese architecture. He collects traditional recipes and compiles them into cooking books. He promotes traditional Balinese cooking through cooking classes in Bali. \n\n[Heinz von Holzen, Chef and Entrepreneur]:\n\"We like to show a little bit what happens in a day of a life in Bali. Mama Bali goes very early in the morning to the market, she goes home, does breakfast, cooks for lunch. Take them a little bit into the culture of Bali, take them of the street and show them that Bali is more then just dances. There are some very beautiful people around and obviously some magnificent food.\"\n\n[Anthony Starratt, Professional Cook]: (English Male)\"It is wonderful; I think being able to see the market first hand and being guided by someone that understands fully the ingredients. It is an amazing experience.\"\n\nAfter 1083 cooking classes, Heinz passion is still intact.\n\n[Denise Thomason, Australian visitor]:\n\"He comes across as if he has just arrived. It is first class. It is really good.\"\n\n[Heinz von Holzen, Chef and Entrepreneur]:\n\"You might call me crazy but we have done so many and we had well over 10,000 participants but I have classes, I am still nervous. Every time it is exciting, every time I go to the market I discover new things, every time you get together with different guest. Today we end up 14 people sitting together, I have got 14 new friends. And this three times a week. It is fantastic.\"\n\nHeinz's future is full of flavor. Besides thinking about a new book and excursions throughout Indonesia's volcanoes, he strives to always improve the taste of his dishes.\n\n[Heinz von Holzen, Chef and Entrepreneur]:\n\"I am hooked at the moment to find places how can we make it taste better. You serve, for example, a simple thing like a fried banana but you serve it a little bit with a raw banana. It is an explosion of flavor. And that is what we try to do with Balinese food.\"\n\nAnd certainly his guests are happy.\n\n[Doug Tear, Australian visitor]:\n\"All those recipes were good, interesting and different.\"\n\nNTD News, Bali, Indonesia.", "title": "Discover Traditional Balinese Food", "publishedDate": "2011-03-21T08:45:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "6LEkyAHfrVw", "description": "2015 GMC YUKON DENALI  RIDING ON 24 INCH CUSTOM BLACK RIMS & TIRES.CUSTOM ALL BLACK ON BLACK WHEELS.

My neighbor just dropped a medium sized black walnut tree because it was problematic. I helped him for the day, and we chain-sawed, lopped, burned and split. In return, he is providing me with more of the stuff than I can possibly use (which is a fair trade if you are a wood-person).  \n\nI do apologize for not taking footage of dropping the tree or using the log splitter (which, incidentally, my neighbor fabricated, and it would have made for an interesting video), but it was a tiring and busy day. I will be uploading some of the process of turning logs into usable material in the near future, so stay tuned. Also, thanks for reading the description. That means that you are a good person; maybe we would even be friends in real life.\n\nSide note: \nDon't drink black walnut tincture. I have found absolutely no evidence to support the claim that it cures anything, or that it has any health benefit whatsoever. In fact, it could make you horribly sick. The year that I made these jars of stain, I ended up with a nasty rash (it was similar to a poison ivy reaction) from the prolonged contact that I had with the walnut juice.

Auf der ganzen Welt, im gem\u00e4ssigten Klima, finden wir Vertreter dieser Familie. Entsprechend ihres nat\u00fcrlichen Verbreitungsgebietes kann sie in Kalt- und Warmwasseraquarien gehalten werden. Je nach Jahreszeiten und Ursprungshabitat liegt die Haltungstemperatur zwischen 0 und 30 Grad. Solange die Blasenschnecke ein pflanzenreiches Gef\u00e4ss vorfindet, mit nicht allzugro\u00dfer Wasserbewegung (Physa) und regelm\u00e4ssigem Wasserwechsel, gibt sie sich auch mit kleinen Beh\u00e4ltnissen zufrieden, aber auch gro\u00dfe Aquarien bev\u00f6lkert sie fleissig. Wir finden die Blasenschnecke in den unterschiedlichsten Gesellschafts- oder Artenbecken. Unpassend f\u00fcr Schneckenliebhaber ist die Vergesellschaftung mit schneckenfressenden Fischen, manchen Garnelenarten oder Krebsen. Hier ist die Population meist schnell ausgerottet. Ein weiteres Problem ist ein Zusammenleben mit Apfelschnecken oder anderen laichfressenden Schneckenarten. In Gesellschaft dieser Arten werden die Blasenschnecken recht z\u00fcgig aussterben.\n(Quelle: allesumdieschnecke.de)\n\nNUTZEN IM AQUARIUM:\nDie Schnecken durchw\u00fchlen den Mulm nach Futter oder fressen zerfallende Pflanzen. Ansonsten fressen sie alles was man als Futter ins Wasser schmeisst: Futtertabs, Flockenfutter und \u00e4hnliches. \n\nBei zuviel Futter vermehren sie sich extrem schnell. Wenn zu viele Schnecken das Becken bev\u00f6lkern gehen sie auch an Pflanzen und k\u00f6nnen bei dadurch auftretendem Nahrungsmangel sehr starke Sch\u00e4den an der Aquarienflora anrichten. Dies geht bis zur Vernichtung des kompletten Pflanzenbewuchses. \n(Quelle: water-paradise.de)", "title": "Die Blasenschnecke im Aquarium", "publishedDate": "2012-03-24T21:15:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "6LapjVh259M", "description": "http://www.4shared.com/zip/RwSiSItx/Hogs_of_War_Voices.html\nJob done, phew.\nHogs of War is a game for the Playstation, it worked much like a 3D Worms game, infact, that was pretty much what it was, however, it's main appeal was its wonderful satire on Political Incorrectness, having factions with outrageous accents, you name it, Americans, British, Russians...\nAll of the voice clips, from the Pigs themselves, the Cigar Chewing Swine in the war chair, and some Queer sounding guy who did the skirmish announcer.\nOh, and some short pieces of music.\nFeel free to use these for whatever, I mean, the company that did this is long gone by now.\n\nIf the link is ever broken, and it will break many times I'm sure, buzz me and I'll re-host it.", "title": "Hogs of War Voices Zip File, for laughs", "publishedDate": "2010-09-26T14:56:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "6LatxiAKJU0", "description": "This screencast lecture overviews functional groups and their chemistry.\nFor more please go to the Royal Society of Chemistry; Learn Chemistry site \nhttp://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resource/listing?searchtext=chemistry+%2B+vignettes\n\nThe Chemistry Vignettes are featured from http://www.chemistryvignettes.net/", "title": "Chemistry Vignettes: Reactions of functional groups", "publishedDate": "2014-01-02T13:52:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "6LaxKX8cTNE", "description": "http://www.cleetree.co.uk/\nbig monterey cypress (cupressus macrocarpa) tree being felled by CLEE TREE SERVICES, on kings road, cleethorpes, lincolnshire. the lower crown of the tree was removed prior to the fell, as to reduce impact on the customers lawn.\nFOR A FREE QUOTE PLEASE CALL BEN ON: 01472 232168", "title": "CLEE TREE SERVICES, big tree fell.", "publishedDate": "2009-09-22T22:37:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "6LbKD9seC5M", "description": "\u8cfc\u5165\u306f\u30b3\u30c1\u30e9\u3000http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00BB76L90/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=1211&creativeASIN=B00BB76L90&linkCode=as2&tag=fxyutoyuto-22\n\u30a2\u30e1\u30c8\u30fc\u30fc\u30af \u3059\u3050\u30e2\u30ce\u8cb7\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3046\u82b8\u4eba 2013.7.4\n\n\u30a2\u30e1\u30c8\u30fc\u30fc\u30af \u3059\u3050\u30e2\u30ce\u8cb7\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3046\u82b8\u4eba\u3000thermos\u771f\u7a7a\u65ad\u71b1\u30bf\u30f3\u30d6\u30e9\u30fc\u5b9f\u9a13\u3057\u3066\u307f\u305f\u3002", "title": "\u30a2\u30e1\u30c8\u30fc\u30fc\u30af \u3059\u3050\u30e2\u30ce\u8cb7\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3046\u82b8\u4eba\u3000thermos\u771f\u7a7a\u65ad\u71b1\u30bf\u30f3\u30d6\u30e9\u30fc\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u307f\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "publishedDate": "2013-07-05T12:40:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6LbMj_FdTeM", "description": "Descarga gratis esta aplicaci\u00f3n en http://www.semantix.com/es_es/nuevo-dixio-desktop/\n\notalgia, diccionario, define, definir, significado, espa\u00f1ol, castellano, Dixio, otalgias", "title": "Definici\u00f3n de otalgia", "publishedDate": "2012-09-19T02:56:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Lb_q5C6RdA", "description": "sorry for awkward video. make sure you subscribe and like this it means a lot!\nFollow me in Instagram to see more about my life in pics,\n@kelsfrzr\n\nFollow me on twitter to see what I'm up to,\n@KELSfrzr\n\nor ask me questions anonymously here,\nAsk.fm/hellokelseykitty\n\nxoxox", "title": "Biotin Vitamins for Hair, Skin, and Nails review!!!", "publishedDate": "2012-12-19T02:58:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "6LcUomCdfTo", "description": "3 H-E", "title": "Beer Lao #1 ( Hot Girls )", "publishedDate": "2007-09-30T16:04:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "6LclqSKBOy8", "description": "Abominable Putridity - Live @ Main Metal Fest (21.03.07)", "title": "Abominable Putridity - Live @ Main Metal Fest (21.03.07)", "publishedDate": "2007-03-23T17:15:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "6LcqbPIBhgs", "description": "The Kapi Mana Motorcycle Club runs the Totara Park trail ride in Regional Council forest several times each year.

It is part of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. Neighbouring provinces are Bangkok, to the north and west, and Chachoengsao to the east. Suvarnabhumi Airport (or also called New Bangkok International Airport) is located in the Bang Phli district of Samut Prakan province.\nThe province was created during the Ayutthaya period, with its administrative centre located at Phra Pradaeng. It was the sea port of Siam, and was secured with forts, town moats and town-walls. King Rama II starting the building of the new centre at Samut Prakan in 1819, after his predecessor King Taksin had disbanded the town fortification. Altogether six forts were built on both sides of the Chao Phraya river, and on an island in the river the pagoda Phra Samut Chedi was erected. These were involved in the Paknam incident of 13 July 1893, which ended the Franco-Siamese War with  the French naval blockade of Bangkok. Of the original six forts only two exist today, Phi Sua Samut and Phra Chulachomklao.\nIn Thai the word Samut is from Sanskrit, samudra, meaning ocean or sea, and the word Prakan is from Sanskrit, pr\u0101k\u0101ra, meaning fortress, walls or stronghold.\nThe provincial seal shows the temple Phra Samut Chedi, the most important site of Buddhist worship in the province. Provincial tree is Thespesia populnea. The provincial slogan is Marine Battle Fortresses, Chedi in the Water, Crocodile Farm, Exquisite Ancient City, Phra Pradaeng Songkran Festival, Tasty Dried Snakeskin Gourami, Rap Bua Festival, Industrial Estate.\nSamut Prakan is located at the mouth of the Chao Phraya river to the Gulf of Thailand. Thus the province is also sometimes called Pak Nam  the Thai word for the mouth of a river. The part of the province located on the western side of the river consist mostly of rice and prawn fields as well as mangrove forests, while the east part is the urban centre - including industrial factories. It is part of the Bangkok metropolis, the urbanization on both sides of the provincial boundary is identical. The province has a coastline of about 47.2 kilometres. Bang Pu Nature Reserve, about 12 km east of the town centre, has a large bird population. Especially during the winter the Sakdi pier at Bang Pu is very popular for Thai people feeding the wintering seagulls. The park is run jointly by the Royal Thai Army and the Thai WWF, and was officially established at the 72nd birthday of Queen Sirikit in 2004.\nThe HTMS Maeklong, a former Royal Thai Navy ship is moored in concrete at Chulachomklao Fort at the mouth of the Chao Phraya in Amphoe Phra Samut Chedi. Two major tourist attractions of the province are located in Amphoe Mueang Samut Prakan, the capital district: Mueang Boran or Ancient City, a park that features downscaled replicas of all major historical buildings of Thailand; and the Crocodile Farm. Besides being the home of Suvarnabhumi Airport, Amphoe Bang Phli is famous for the annual Lotus Flower ( Rap Bua ) festival, which usually takes place on the full moon in October\nThe province is sub divided into 6 districts (Amphoe). The districts are further sub divided into 50 sub districts (Tambon) and 396 villages (Muban). There are one city (thesaban nakhon), three towns (thesaban mueang) and 13 sub district municipalities (thesaban tambon). For the national elections the province is divided into 3 voting districts, one eligible for three assemblyman and the other two each for two assembly men.\nMueang Samut Prakan    Bang Bo    Bang Phli    Phra Pradaeng    Phra Samut Chedi    Bang Sao Thong", "title": "Samut Prakan Province, Bhumibol Bridge, formerly the Industrial Ring Road Bridge, Thailand.

Or, what we just call paradiddle diddle. \n\nNow, what it is, is exactly what it's saying. Para diddle diddle, meaning a set of singles, para, followed by a diddle which is a double on one side, and then a double on the other side. Now, this one does not alternate. If you're starting with your strong hand, you're going to start with that hand, it's going to end on your weak hand and then you're going to restart it on your strong hand again.\n\nOnce you've practiced it on one side, my suggestion is to repeat it on the other side, to build that side up as well. I'm going to play it on the right side so you can hear it slowly, and then work it up in time, faster.\n\n[drum]\n\nThe paradiddle diddle is a very interesting rudiment to play around the drums, as you can take that accent and displace it to different surface, and also add little grace notes on the base drum or the high hat, or some areas into it. So, a mix of paradiddle diddles on a different surface would sound something like this. \n\n[drum]\n\nThe paradiddle diddle is very interesting, that it could be more of a drum fill or a drum solo rather than just a drum rudiment itself. Either way, make sure to get the rudiment right. Make it clean, and practice it on both sides of your body.", "title": "How to Play Single Paradiddle-Diddle | Drumming", "publishedDate": "2013-09-04T00:38:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "6LqeM6YerwA", "description": "What is Azalea?\nA report all about Azalea for homework/assignment\n\nAzaleas are flowering shrubs in the genus Rhododendron, particularly sections Tsutsuji (evergreen) and Pentanthera (deciduous).

Which in my past i've noticed that some plants are heavy feeders, and some are not, and some like more calcium/magnesium than others.\n\nSo the CONTROL is what i love. During a flushing, you can just wipe out the bucket and start new. \n\nI also like the ease of which it can run at. The yields are much bigger,and the turnaround times when doing any kind of training is much faster. \n\nWhat's buggy about it, is that you aren't able to do much scrogging. Changing the bucket out for scrogs can be a bitch. Unless you have a self-draining bucket (note to self: Create one!)\n\nI've been looking into RDWC so maybe if i find the right pheno, i'll mother her out, and switch it up to RDWC, and do mono-strain.

Today, we went through 3 hours of seizures presenting in many different forms.  \n\nThey included the ability or him to 'rate' the seizure or the strength of the seizure.  He said that earlier it was 110.  At that point, he kept his eyes closed.  He did not speak, and his fists were clenched.  That went on for more than an hour.  Many people were still trying to decide if he was having a seizure.  In the ER, I had to INSIST he was having a status seizure.  He walked into the ER with my guidance.  He was not convulsing.  It did not LOOK like a seizure.

Clemmer, Robert Greenhut, Joseph Hartwick, Amy Lemisch, Penny Marshall, Bill Pace\nScreenwriter: Kim Wilson, Kelly Candaele, Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandel\nFilm Description: The All-American Girls' Professional Baseball League was founded in 1943, when most of the men of baseball-playing age were far away in Europe and Asia fighting World War II. The league flourished until after World War II, when, with the men's return, the league was consigned to oblivion. Director Penny Marshall and screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel re-create the wartime era when women's baseball looked to stand a good chance of sweeping the country. The story begins as a candy-bar tycoon enlists agents to scour the country to find women who could play ball. In the backwoods of Oregon, two sisters -- Dottie (Geena Davis) and Kit (Lori Petty) -- are discovered. Dottie can hit and catch, while Kit can throw a mean fastball. The girls come to Chicago to try out for the team with other prospects that include their soon-to-be-teammates Mae Mordabito (Madonna), Doris Murphy (Rosie O'Donnell), and Marla Hooch (Megan Cavanagh). The team's owner, Walter Harvey (Gary Marshall) needs someone to coach his team and he picks one-time home-run champion Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks), who is now a broken-down alcoholic. After a few weeks of training, as Dugan sobers up, the team begins to show some promise. By the end of the season, the team has improved to the point where they are competing in the World Series (which is no big deal, since there are only four teams in the league).\n\n\"a league of their own\",\"a league of their own clip\",\"a league of their own part 1\",\"keith schrader\",\"sports comedies\",\"sports dramas\",\"20th century period pieces\",comedy,drama,\"robert greenhut\",\"penny marshall\",\"amy lemisch\",\"elliot abbott\",\"ronnie d clemmer\",\"bill pace\",\"joseph hartwick\",\"sportsmanship videos\",\"teamwork videos\",\"basketball game videos\",umpire,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++28669,/m/0gccm97", "title": "There's No Crying in Baseball - A League of Their Own (5/8) Movie CLIP (1992) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-21T21:00:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6M8yZq_Ff4A", "description": "T-Shirts!

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "2015 SUBARU WRX CONCEPT first official video", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T22:28:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "6MAs-15exTg", "description": "Makin vids", "title": "Makin vids", "publishedDate": "2012-10-27T17:29:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6MAtYrMci98", "description": "", "title": "Natural Pink Sapphire Corundum (PS1347)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-13T16:51:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "6MB0T6MoMjI", "description": "", "title": "FROM ENGLISH TO GERMAN = floriculture", "publishedDate": "2011-12-14T06:56:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "6MB9M-h4hdk", "description": "", "title": "Epidural analgesia in dog", "publishedDate": "2012-10-06T10:04:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "6MBkSjaD_io", "description": "MUTILASI AROGANSI\n\ndia dimutilasi sampai habis terbagi \nberikan pada binatang\nmeremuk jiwa nihil,\nmenghimpit keluh dan dosa\n\n(arogansi bertahta)\nkuliti gengsinya,\nsodomi angkuhnya\n(dan butakan mereka)\nmati terkubur sumpah\n(arogansi bertahta)\nsumpah sampah\n(binasakan jiwanya)\nlaut darah tanpa dasar adalah tempat mereka\n\n..dia lahir dari benci, dia mati\ntermutilasi arogansi..\n\njiwa baja terbalut gengsi sampah menyekap\nrealita\njunjung tinggi martabat buta\ngaungkan emosi\njiwa baja terbalut gengsi sampah menyekap\nrealita", "title": "VENDETTA - Mutilasi Arogansi New Line Up", "publishedDate": "2010-03-30T18:53:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "6MBoXqvnQIA", "description": "v\u00eddeo de Ghumberto3Degeneracion hepatolenticular\nDefinici\u00f3n:\nEs Un Trastorno hereditario En El Cual heno Demasiado Cobre en los Tejidos Corporales.
