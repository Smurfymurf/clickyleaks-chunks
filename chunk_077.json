Suggerimenti e consigli per curarle e combatterle.\n\nhttp://www.giardinaggio.it/video - In collaborazione con la sezione video di Giardinaggio.it . Sul terrazzo si sviluppano generalmente le stesse malattie funginee presenti in giardino.\nUna tra quelle che si manifestano pi\u00f9 facilmente \u00e8 l'oidio; si tratta di un fungo che attacca la pagina superiore del fogliame, causando larghe maculature di colore bianco, simili a farina o zucchero a velo; con il passare del tempo le maculature scuriscono, e arricciano la pagina fogliare. \nQuesto tipo di malattia si sviluppa di preferenza in primavera, ed \u00e8 favorita dalla presenza di umidit\u00e0 sul fogliame; per prevenire lo svilupparsi dell'oidio \u00e8 in genere sufficiente evitare di annaffiare le piante nella parte aerea quando l'escursione termica quotidiana \u00e8 elevata. Nei periodi con notti fresche e precipitazioni elevate l'oidio tende a svilupparsi con facilit\u00e0, si cura utilizzando fungicidi a base di zolfo.\nAltra malattia fungina molto diffusa \u00e8 la fumaggine, causata da funghi che colonizzano le melate percolate sul fogliame dagli insetti, quali afidi o cocciniglie; generalmente curare tempestivamente le piante colpite da insetti scongiura la possibilit\u00e0 che si sviluppino fumaggini; se dovessero svilupparsi talvolta \u00e8 sufficiente ripulire il fogliame con un panno in microfibra, ma in caso di sviluppo ampio della malattia \u00e8 consigliabile praticare trattamenti a base di rame.\nLE altre malattie fungine che si sviluppano con grande facilit\u00e0 sono la muffa grigia (botrite), ed i marciumi radicali o del colletto; si tratta di muffe e maculature che si sviluppano alla base della pianta o sul fogliame, con conseguente deperimento rapido della pianta intera; generalmente lo sviluppo di questi tipi di funghi \u00e8 altamente favorito dalle condizioni ambientali e da metodi di coltivazione non idonei.\nI marciumi si sviluppano di preferenza in terreni asfittici, umidi, con acqua stagnante; quindi corrette annaffiature scongiurano lo svilupparsi di tali patologie.\nScarsit\u00e0 di ventilazione, alta umidit\u00e0 ambientale ed eccessi di concimazioni a base di zolfo favoriscono invece lo sviluppo della botrite, principale causa della muffa grigia.\n\n\n\nNel canale video http://www.youtube.com/user/GIARDINAGGIOpuntoIT moltissime guide sulla coltivazione delle tue piante e consigli sulla loro cura.\nIscriviti al nostro canale per rimanere sempre aggiornato http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=GIARDINAGGIOpuntoIT\n \nSeguici su:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Giardinaggioit/133180016703498\nGoogle Plus: https://plus.google.com/+giardinaggio/posts\n \nIl nostro sito:\nGiardinaggio.it: http://www.giardinaggio.it/\nForum di Giardinaggio.it http://forum.giardinaggio.it/", "title": "principali malattie funginee", "publishedDate": "2011-03-27T08:02:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "3oDtiSilWrM", "description": "Bien", "title": "Shark sport watch Gulper Shark SH107", "publishedDate": "2014-04-06T08:57:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "3oEJ_t46LgE", "description": "", "title": "Day Three as a Non-Smoker", "publishedDate": "2011-01-13T21:10:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "3oEki7WDPkY", "description": "Danaea Davis 2015", "title": "Double fronts take 2", "publishedDate": "2013-07-03T13:13:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "3oEklPFde0k", "description": "8-27-2006 Reading, England\nJust felt like uploading this :P", "title": "Pearl Jam - I Am Mine (Reading '06)", "publishedDate": "2008-11-14T18:07:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "3oEnJlUQcGo", "description": "This is a music video for the song \"Vulgarity in Nature\" by Mailbox Badger, a Punk Rock/ Dub Reggae/ Jazz Instrumental Project. \n\nThe video was made using legally obtained public domain stock footage and does not violate copyright laws anywhere on Planet Earth. \n\nThis song is on the 7th Mailbox Badger record released in 2013 entitled \"When the Calendar Turns.\" For more information on that everything else Mailbox Badger related, visit http://www.mailboxbadger.com", "title": "Mailbox Badger \"Vulgarity in Nature\" Music Video", "publishedDate": "2013-12-24T02:57:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "3oEoLySV_mU", "description": "Dinah Shore\n\nFrances Rose Shore (Winchester, 1 de marzo de 1917 - Beverly Hills, 24 de febrero de 1994), conocida como Dinah Shore, fue una cantante estadounidense de jazz y m\u00fasica popular.\nFraguada en las big bands de los a\u00f1os treinta, Dinah se convirti\u00f3 en los cuarenta en una de las artistas m\u00e1s populares de los Estados Unidos gracias a su interpretaci\u00f3n de numerosos \u00e9xitos musicales, como \"Buttons and Bows\", \"The Gypsy\" y \"I\u00b4ll Walk Alone\", y en a\u00f1os sucesivos gracias a su aparici\u00f3n en varios programas televisivos.\nNacida en el rural del estado de Tennessee, Dinah Shore trabaj\u00f3 en la radio de Nashville ya cuando era adolescente.

I'm also a practicing oncologist, and mom, and also a breast cancer survivor. So I'm happy to share information with you today that could help protect your life against breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer is relatively unusual. It only accounts for about 1 to 6 percent of all breast cancers to affect women and it tends to be an aggressive from of breast cancer. It comes on with usually pinkness, swelling of the breast and enlargements of the whole breast and only about half the time is there also a lump inside the breast. The reason for the pinkness and the swelling, is the breast cancer cells involve the skin of the breast and kind of block drainage of the fluid draining of the breast and that's why the breast get enlarged. It used to be that inflammatory breast cancer involved a high risk of death. The good news is that with effective treatment from all the disciplines - surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy and radiation therapy, together with supportive care, many women who have inflammatory breast cancer can have a long life span and be cancer free. Another thing to notice is it if u have pinkness and swelling of the breast and your doctor thinks it could just be a mastitis which means an infection of the breast go ahead and try the antibiotic treatment that they'll prescribe for you\nbut if the breast pinkness and swelling does not respond to the antibiotics its important to take it a step further and ask to see a breast specialist because many cases of inflammatory breast cancer are diagnosed on the later side of things because the primary care physician thinks its an infection of the breast - which usually is but if it doesn't respond like an infection should then you need to take to the next step check it out and make sure that there is nothing more serious going on like inflammatory breast cancer.\"", "title": "What Is Inflammatory Breast Cancer? | Breast Cancer", "publishedDate": "2011-09-27T18:02:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "3oI4niB2k4M", "description": "les voisins d'en dessous, bistro de paris, 23 juin 2007", "title": "les voisins d'en dessous, cerumen", "publishedDate": "2007-06-23T13:31:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "3oIYDPgeIxg", "description": "Absinthe.

An anime television series produced by White Fox was broadcast between April and June 2012. A second season titled Jormungand: Perfect Order aired from October to December 2012. The first season has been licensed by Manga Entertainment in the United Kingdom and Dybex in France. Both seasons have been licensed by Funimation Entertainment in North America.\n\nThe series follows Koko Hekmatyar, a young arms dealer who sells weapons under HCLI, an international shipping corporation that secretly deals in the arms trade. As one of the company's unofficial weapon dealers, she secretly sells weapons in many countries while avoiding the local authorities and law enforcement agencies as most of her work is actually illegal under international law. Traveling with her is her team of bodyguards who are mostly composed of ex-military veterans. Her latest addition to her crew is Jonah, a seemingly emotionless child soldier who is skilled in combat yet ironically hates arms dealers. What follows is Koko and her crew's escapades around the world.\n\nAn anime animated by White Fox and produced by Geneon was announced on the 10th volume of the manga. The anime began airing on April 10, 2012 on Tokyo MX, Television Kanagawa, TV Aichi and KBS and on later dates on Sun TV, BS11 and AT-X. The show will also be seen online in Showtime, NicoNico, Bandai Channel and GyaO. A second season of the series was also announced and is slated to be released in October 2012. Known as Jormungand: Perfect Order, it began broadcast on Japanese TV on October 9, 2012. The two seasons aired on Japanese TV at 12:30 AM.\n\nThe first release of Jormungand on DVD and Blu-ray was on June 27, 2012 with the first two episodes, \"Gun Metal, Calico Road\" and \"Pulsar\" included. Subsequent releases followed with two episodes each on both Blu-rays and DVDs on July 25, August 29 and September 26 of 2012. The Perfect Order DVD/Blu-Rays was first released in Japan on December 21, 2012.\n\nShowgate handles licensing aspect of Jormungand outside Japan. A sneak preview of the anime was held on March 31 to April 1, 2012 at the Anime Contents Expo at the Makuhari Messe in Chiba.\n\nThe manga is published in North America by VIZ Media. In Japan, Jormungand is officially published by Shogakukan. In Taiwan, it is licensed and published by Taiwan Tohan.\n\nBoth the opening and ending themes will be produced by I've Sound. The opening song is \"Borderland\" by Mami Kawada, and the ending theme is \"Ambivalentidea\" by Nagi Yanagi. \"Borderland\" was released as a single on May 30, 2012, while \"Ambivalentidea\" was released as a single on June 6, 2012. Both songs were released as singles by the record label Geneon Universal Entertainment. For the second season, the opening is \"Under / Shaft\" by Maon Kurosaki, while the ending is \"Laterality\" (\u30e9\u30c6\u30e9\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3) by Nagi Yanagi.\n\nScott Green, writing for Ain't It Cool News, summed up the series as being enjoyable, but underachieving. Matthew Warner feels that the story in the fourth volume is more focused on the business of trading weapons, describing it as a nice change of pace for the story, but Warner was disappointed that the violence and \"dark, twisted plot points\" of earlier volumes in the series were not present. Erica Friedman, organiser of Yuricon, noted the yuri potential of Valmet, but declared the manga to be \"just a dumb manga that I really like\". Karen Maeda enjoyed the action shown in the sixth volume, regarding the panels as being easy to follow, and hoped that Jormungand would be produced as an anime.\n\nIn Japan, the manga's 9th Volume sold 41,712 copies in a week for a total of 42,337 in the 27th place out of 30. Jormungand's 11th Volume was in 10th place and had sold 70,593 copies. It later placed itself in the 20th place out of 30, selling 34,697 copies weekly for a total of 105,290.", "title": "Jormungand Perfect Order OST Soundtrack Convoy", "publishedDate": "2013-03-30T21:13:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "3oQ7pugqN2M", "description": "", "title": "baptista purple smoke video", "publishedDate": "2013-06-15T16:20:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "3oQdg25wno8", "description": "Subscribe to Tele Flick for all the juicy gossip, latest buzz & news from all the popular hindi serials running on all major Indian TV channels.

Poon and Alan Stecker). You can read more about the Centenarian Study on our website ( http://www.publichealth.uga.edu/geron/research/centenarian_study.html ).\n\nA keystone research project at the Institute of Gerontology ( http://www.publichealth.uga.edu/geron/ ) is the Georgia Centenarian Study (1988 to 2008) of longevity and survival of the oldest old, led by the Institute Director Emeritus, Leonard W. Poon, and funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute of Aging. An unprecedented number of elders in the coming decades will face the risks of disease, frailty, and dependence. The population at the highest risk is the oldest of the old who are increasing at the fastest rate among those who are 65 years and older.\n\nCentenarians by definition are survivors who have lived to at least 100, which is more than 20 years longer than the average life expectancy. A fundamental challenge is to understand how centenarians live longer and what specific biological, psychological, and sociological characteristics they possess that would allow them to survive longer. Another basic challenge is whether we could generalize the knowledge gained in our volumes of aging research to individuals of average life expectancy, which is in their 70s (e.g., the MacArthur Study), to individuals who live 20 to 30 years longer. \n\nAt the extreme longevity of the human species, centenarians represent the ultimate range of independence and dependence, frailty and strength. There is much to be learned from centenarians about survival, disease, frailty, and independence, for all who hope to maintain health and a successful quality of life in older adulthood. The Georgia Centenarian Study is broken into 3 phases: Phase 1 (1988-1992), Phase 2 (1992-1998) and Phase 3 (2001-2009).\n\nSelect Articles About This Study\n\nSydney Morning Herald (2010): http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/mastering-the-art-of-100-years-of-fortitude-20101110-17nmt.html\nUGA Research Magazine (2009): http://researchmagazine.uga.edu/aa/spring2009/aging-gracefully.php\nSharp Brains (2009): http://www.sharpbrains.com/blog/2009/11/07/100-is-the-new-65-living-longer-and-better/\n\nOur Important Links\n\nInstitute of Gerontology at the University of Georgia: http://www.publichealth.uga.edu/geron\nGeorgia Geriatric Education Center (Resources and training about best practices in the aging field): http://training.geron.uga.edu\nList of aging resources: http://training.geron.uga.edu/other_resources\nUGA Gerontology YouTube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/ugagerontology\nUGA Gerontology Vimeo Channel: http://vimeo.com/channels/ugagerontology\nElder Cohousing & Other Intentional Communities: http://www.geron.uga.edu/eic/elderintentionalcommunities.html", "title": "Georgia Centenarian Study (Pt. 15): Cognitive Function & Distal Variables", "publishedDate": "2010-11-11T21:33:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "3o_dJ6OPmfc", "description": "How to juggle 3 balls in the shower pattern.

We decided to keep the shot tight on the cats so that they did not need to be airborne very long. The cats were tossed a few feet into an enormous and ultra soft sheepskin blanket. The cats were treated like royalty. They were fed gourmet cat food and lots of water. We took many breaks where the kittens rested and played in the shade.

Almost all of these shrimps are farm raised, produced by the 122 independent shrimp processing factories, with over 300,000 workers. Shrimps that enter the processing factories come from over 21,000 different farms with over 77,000 laborers. More than 85% of these farms are small independent businesses. \n\nFarmed shrimps are fed on domestically manufactured shrimp feed, They amount to 600,000 tons per year. The manufacture of shrimp feed provides more than 46,500 jobs. 90% of Shrimp Feed is made up of other ingredients while just only 10% of the ingredients come from fishmeal factories.\nThese factories purchase small, left over fish from fishing vessels, which provide a livelihood for more than 190,000 fishermen. \n\nThailand\u2019s shrimp farming industry involves more than 620,000 laborers, which is about the same amount of population living in Washington D.C. All these laborers are working in Thailand legally. \n\nHowever, forced-labor is not to be taken lightly and it could exist on illegal vessels operating in international waters which rarely comes into port. These vessels are considered small number compared to legally operated vessels.\nSo, the important question is, could forced-labor really be stopped by a boycott of Thai shrimp products? \nInvestigating further, then will find that the main business of these large fishing vessels is to catch larger, more valuable fish for human consumption.  All the other small fish, so-called by-catch, that may have been captured during the main fishing process, are then sold through wholesalers to fishmeal factories, where it is used to produce the fishmeal that makes up 10% of the shrimp feed.\n\nTherefore, if the whole Thai shrimp industry were to suffer, even then the illegal offshore fishing vessels that may be using forced-labor would only lose the small amount they earn from the small fish with little value. So a boycott of shrimp products from Thailand is very unlikely to affect the illegal fishing vessels suspected of using forced-labor. \n\nHowever, if the whole Thai shrimp industry were to collapse, 600,000 innocent, legal workers and laborers, over 2 million lives if you include their families, would have their livelihood destroyed. \n\nForced-labor is a critical issue. Government institutions, officials, and police have been working very hard, as well as developing the law enforcement system, to tackle and solve this issue.  At the same time, we, as a community, are doing everything we can to help.  However well-intentioned, boycotting shrimp from Thailand could create crisis in the Thai shrimp industry which could lead to an even more severe problem.  Boycotting Thai Shrimp will affect millions of legal, innocent workers and their families.", "title": "Understanding Thai Shrimp Industry (Infographics)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-28T15:28:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "3p-1mjUiJGc", "description": "Facebook Page: http://facebook.com/OfficialFreshPrinceYuup\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/Fresh\nTwitch:  http://www.twitch.tv/FreshPrinceYuup\nInstagram: @FreshPrinceYuup\nEmail: Bookings@FreshPrinceYuup.com \n\nGaming Channel: http://youtube.com/FreshPrinceYuupHD\n\nSUBSCRIBE!

The condition is characterized by local pain, swelling and tenderness of the tuberosity. \n\nOSD is thought to be caused by repetitive strain and chronic avulsion of the secondary ossification center of the tibial tuberosity, i.e., by small injuries due to repeated overuse before the area has finished growing. The repetitive strain is from the strong pull of the quadriceps muscle produced during sporting activities, particularly during running, jumping and climbing. Accordingly, OSD is common in adolescents who play soccer, basketball and volleyball, and who participate in gymnastics. The tibial tuberosity avulsion continues to grow, ossify and enlarge. The intervening area may become fibrous, creating a localized nonunion, or may show complete bony union with mild enlargement of the tibial tuberosity. In any case, the result is a traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle. \n\nDiagnosis is based on the clinical features of the disease and on diagnostic imaging. Particularly in unilateral cases of OSD plain radiographs of the knee are recommended to rule out other conditions such as acute tibial apophyseal fracture, infection, or tumor. \n\nThe true incidence of OSD is unknown. The predominant age is between 12 and 15 years in boys and between 8 and 12 years in girls, coinciding with periods of growth spurts. Boys are more affected than girls (approximately 3:1).

It's a very serious issue, and Bully manages to capture just how real and disgusting it truly is. The documentary has its shortcomings, but it serves its purpose, and it's the best we have right now to shine a light on the issue and create awareness. \n\nIntro Beat by Dephorix\n\nThe full movie is on Youtube if you wanna watch it: http://youtu.be/GBbBWR6mS4A\n\n\nBully\n\nSynopsis:\nA documentary on peer-to-peer bullying in schools across America.\n\nDirector: Lee Hirsch\nWriters: Lee Hirsch and Cynthia Lowen\n\nCast:\nJa'Meya Jackson, Kelby Johnson, Lona Johnson, Bob Johnson, Alex Libby, Jackie Libby, Philip Libby, Maya Libby, Jada Libby, Etahn Libby, Logan Libby, Kim Lockwood, David Long, Tina Long, Teryn Long.\n\nGenre: Documentary | Drama | Humanitarianism - Bullying\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\nRuntime: 98 min (1 hr 38 min)\nRelease Date: 27 April 2012\n\nBudget: $1,100,000 (estimated)\nDomestic Gross: $3,495,043 (USA)\nForeign Gross: $182,203\nWorldwide Gross: $3,677,246\n\nPlot:\nThis year, over 13 million American kids will be bullied at school, online, on the bus, at home, through their cell phones and on the streets of their towns, making it the most common form of violence young people in this country experience. BULLY is the first feature documentary film to show how we've all been affected by bullying, whether we've been victims, perpetrators or stood silent witness. The world we inhabit as adults begins on the playground. BULLY opens on the first day of school. For the more than 13 million kids who'll be bullied this year in the United States, it's a day filled with more anxiety and foreboding than excitement. As the sun rises and school busses across the country overflow with backpacks, brass instruments and the rambunctious sounds of raging hormones, this is a ride into the unknown. For a lot of kids, the only thing that's certain is that this year, like every other, bullying will be a big part of whatever meets them at their school's front doors. Every school in the U.S. is grappling with bullying-each day more than 160,000 kids across the country are absent because they're afraid of being bullied-but for many districts it's just one more problem that gets swept under the rug. BULLY is a character-driven film. At its heart are those with the most at stake and whose stories each represent a different facet of this crisis. From the first day of school through the last, BULLY will intimately explore the lives of a few of the many courageous people bullying will touch this year.\n\n\nThe Bully Project | The Weinstein Company\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMain Channel: http://youtube.com/kkortez\n\nSpanish Channel: http://youtube.com/eskkortez\n\nGaming Channel: http://youtube.com/GAMEZwithKORTEZ\n\nPersonal Spanish Channel: http://www.youtube.com/ESKKortezOtravez\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/kkortez/\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/kkortez/\n\nBlog: http://kkortez.tumblr.com/\n\nGoogle Plus: http://Gplus.to/kkortez\n\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/kkortez\n\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/kkortez/\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "title": "Bully - Philip DeFranco Movie Club Review", "publishedDate": "2013-04-18T01:35:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "3pSJTjNAQ-c", "description": "My buddy making it upstream in his pontoon.", "title": "Ferrying upstream to some fishing grounds.", "publishedDate": "2013-12-22T03:16:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "3pSQ170K7sg", "description": "Cujo gets fed up with Holly's antics and leaves, thus leaving me and the camera as the only things for her to play with.", "title": "Tail Biting and Corgi Cuteness", "publishedDate": "2010-03-04T04:33:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "3pSSlH93G1U", "description": "Every performance must establish a world for its play.

Using this method you can fill a Chest or Deep Storage Unit with your materials of choice and let the Filler work unattended.\n\nModes are set with the built-in crafting grid using brick blocks and glass blocks.\n\nAs of BuildCraft version 3.4+, any blocks that cannot be obtained by breaking it with your fist, will only drop as an item after 1/2 a second and then disappear after a further 1/2 a second. This prevents use of the filler as a cheap quarry alternative.\n\nBuildcraft tutorials in minutes.", "title": "Filler (Tekkit/Feed The Beast) - Minecraft In Minutes", "publishedDate": "2013-01-30T15:10:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "3pfygyq_s7o", "description": "--- click on english subtitles to move them upwards ---\nLa pi\u00f9 grande RAP BATTLE che l'Italia ricordi!\n\nwww.seventhart.it\n\nSe vi \u00e8 piaciuto e volete vedere nuove sfide sostenetelo.

As your attorney, we are unable to give you an exact amount as each case has different injuries and medical treatments.\n\nThe jury will ultimately decide what to reward you based on the injuries you suffered and how those injuries are going to affect your life, both short-term and long-term effects. If they award you damages, you may be wondering why there are different types of damages and what that means for you.        \nIn personal injury cases, there are compensatory damages and punitive damages. Damages rewarded to compensate you for your lost wages, medical bills, and other costs are called compensatory damages. Punitive damages are inflicted more to punish the party responsible when their acts are willful against the injured party.   \n\nFor more information about personal injury accidents and our firm, visit our educational website at http://www.yourlawyer.com/topics/overview/personal_injury_lawyer.

According to police reports, Kincade told staff at a charter school that he was armed with a gun. Police were called to scene and searched Kincade. They found a pocket knife but no gun and told Kincade to stay away from the school.\n\nAs Kincade was leaving, his wheelchair hit Davidson's foot. The cop responded by pushing Kincade over. The paraplegic topples out of the wheelchair and onto the ground.\n\nKincade was arrested and charged with battery against a police officer, a charge that was later dismissed. Meanwhile, Davidson was given a 30-day suspension, but he got to keep his job.\n\nShould he have been fired?

Carefree, easy to grow evergreen shrub with large white flowers in summer. Petals are splotched with magenta near the bright yellow centers.   Most do not like being pruned any more than the removal of spent flowers, and will not regrow from old wood. Shrubs can be short-lived, lasting only a few years, but are easily propagated by softwood cuttings taken from new shoots in summer.  Evergreen shrubs ranging from 1.5 to 2 meters in height. Flowers of Cistus have 5 showy petals of purple, pink, white or cream colors. A number of hybrids and cultivars are also available; however, the most popular of these flowering shrubs is Cistus Ladanifer. It is grown for ornamental purposes and to extract aromatic material, Labdanum, which is naturally found in the leaves of Cistus Ladanifer. Ladbanum is commercially sold and is used as an important ingredient in several perfumes.  The plant is characterized by its white flowers with a yellow center and maroon spots at the base. Most species of Cistus can be grown easily from seeds. These flowering shrubs prefer a sunny spot where they receive average water and are protected from frost. http://www.thelovelyplants.com/aromatic-flowering-shrub-cistus-ladanifer/\n\nThe Cistaceae are known for their beautiful shrubs, which are profusely covered by flowers at the time of blossom. This family consists of about 170-200 species in eight genera, distributed primarily in the temperate areas of Europe and the Mediterranean basin, but also found in North America; a limited number of species are found in South America. Most Cistaceae are subshrubs and low shrubs, and some are herbaceous. They prefer dry and sunny habitats. Cistaceae grow well on poor soils, and many of them are cultivated in gardens. They often have showy yellow, pink or white flowers, which are generally short-lived. The flowers are bisexual, regular, solitary or borne in cymes; they usually have five, sometimes three, petals (Lechea). The petals are free, usually crumpled in the bud, and sometimes in the open flower (e. g. Cistus incanus). It has five sepals, the inner three of which are distinctly wider, and the outer two are narrow and sometimes regarded as bracteoles. The sepal arrangement is a characteristic property of the family. The stamens are numerous, of variable length, and sit on a disc; filaments are free. The ovary is superior, usually with three carpels; placentation is parietal, with two or more ovules on each placenta. The fruit is a capsule, usually with five or ten valves (three in Helianthemum). The seeds are small, with a hard, water-impermeable coating, weighing around 1 mg. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistaceae \n\nCistaceae are small broadleaf evergreen shrubs or subshrubs, most of which originated in the Mediterranean area. They prefer dry, sunny habitats and poor soils. The flowers are yellow, pink, or white, although some cultivars are multi-colored. Many of these plants can create a symbiotic relationship with root fungi of genus Tuber. All of them are well adapted to surviving wildfires. Several Cistus species exude ladanum, a sticky aromatic substance that is used in the manufacture of incense and that forms part of the Holy Oil of the Greek Orthodox Church. Ladanum has been collected since antiquity. One common collection method involved letting goats graze among the plants and then combing the ladanum that stuck to the hair of their legs and beards. Cistus should be grown on poor to moderately fertile soil with a gritty texture. An overly rich soil stimulates soft growth that is not likely to live through the winter. Don't use compost or an organic mulch; a gravel mulch is acceptable. These plants tolerate a fairly wide pH range, although there is some variability among the species. : http://garden.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Rock_Rose \n\nThe whole plant is covered with the sticky exudate of fragrant resin.\nC. ladanifer is particularly well suited to the Continentalized Mediterranean climate, standing both long summer droughts and cold weather. It is an extremely aggressive plant which has taken over much of former farmland and grasslands in the mountain regions of central Spain. In Spanish it is known as Jara pringosa meaning \"sticky shrub\". C. ladanifer has been found to have mycorrhizal associations with Boletus edulis, Boletus rhodoxanthus, and Laccaria laccata.\nIt is a popular ornamental plant, grown for its strongly resin-scented foliage and conspicuous flowers. Its leaves yield a fragrant oleoresin known as labdanum, used in perfumes, especially as a fixative.", "title": "Gum Rockrose - Cistus Ladanifer - Klettar\u00f3s - Bl\u00f3mstrndi runni - Gar\u00f0sk\u00e1laplanta", "publishedDate": "2013-08-14T18:03:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3psFSNAe5K4", "description": "Follow Us:\nfacebook : https://www.facebook.com/thbestsmartp...\ntwitter : https://twitter.com/tbestsmartphone\ngoogle + :https://plus.google.com/113730735864291497086\nSubscribe youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/thebestsmartphones\n\n\nHTC Mogul -HTC Titan\nThe HTC Titan is an EVDO Rev.

Lupe eta Loles kideak MCD taldeko kide batzuen ahizpak ziren eta elkarrekin askotan jo zuten. Vulpes maketa pare bat ekoiztu zituzten bere garaian, kantu eta letra punki, zaratatsu eta ausartekin. Baina beraien lehen diskoa grabatzeko bidean zirenean, banandu ziren, zoritxarrez. Izan ere, 1983. urteko apirilean, Madrilgo telebista kate batean beraien bideoklipa bat jarri ondoren, eskuin muturreko komunikabide eta kazetariek ehiza mediatiko erraldoi bat hasi zuten lau nesken kontra. Sekulako zalaparta sortu zen \"Me gusta ser una zorra\" leloa abesten zutelako soilik. Vulpes epaituak izan ziren Espainiar fiskal nagusiaren aginduz. Azkenean, salaketa hura deuseztu zen, baina hiru urte luzeen ondoren. \n\n1993. urtean, Lupe hil zen, eta bere omenez,10 urte beranduago,, Bilboko Errekalde auzoan kontzertu polita eskeini zuten Vulpes taldeko kideak. Ehundaka pertsona bildu ginen Kukutza gaztetxe zaharraren inguruko plaza batean, Azaroak 29 larunbata gauean, hain zuzen. Hain harrera beroa ikusirik, 2005. urtean, 20 urte lehenago zintzilik utzitako disko luze hura grabatzera ausartu ziren. \"Me gusta ser...Vulpes\" izenburuaz.\n\nDOKUMENTALA... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZEURI31IOg\n...........................................................................................\nUna canci\u00f3n del grupo vasco Vulpes. Grabada en vivo hacia 1985, en la m\u00edtica sala punk El Garage, en el barrio de San Ignacio (Bilbao).\n\nVulpes surgieron en el Gran Bilbao, a comienzos de los a\u00f1os 80, en pleno auge del punk rock en Euskadi. Ellas fueron la primera hornada seria, junto a los MCD, Eskorbuto, Odio, Basura, RIP.... Tras varios movimientos durante un a\u00f1o y pico, Vulpes encuentran estabilidad hacia 1982, con Loles a la guitarra, Lupe a la bater\u00eda, Bego\u00f1a Astigarraga al bajo y la gran Mamen Rodrigo a la voz. El repertorio estaba conformado por entonces por versiones de los Ramones, como \"Commando\" o \"Suzy es una cabezota\" (\"Sheena is a punk-rocker\"), de Loquillo (\"Es s\u00f3lo un sue\u00f1o\") y canciones propias. \n\nPero, en Abril de 1983, lleg\u00f3 el desastre. Una simple emisi\u00f3n televisiva de su canci\u00f3n \"Me gusta ser una zorra\", una estupenda versi\u00f3n de Iggy Pop y The Stooges (\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\"), provoc\u00f3 un enorme esc\u00e1ndalo. El periodista Carlos Tena seleccion\u00f3 a cuatro grupos vascos para rodar varios videoclips para su exitoso programa \"Caja de Ritmos\" en TVE. La publicaci\u00f3n integra de la letra de la canci\u00f3n de las Vulpes en un diario nacional reavivo una feroz campa\u00f1a de desprestigio contra ellas y la m\u00fasica punk. La carrera de las Vulpes se vio boicoteada sin remedio y se disolvieron. \n\nDos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, en 1985, Vulpes se reunieron de nuevo para tocar en la vieja sala punk El Garage de Bilbao, que necesitaba fondos para evitar el cierre. Vulpes tocaron todo un fin de semana, el viernes, junto a Kortatu y Gazte Hilak, y el s\u00e1bado, junto a RIP y los MCD. El precio de la entrada era de 500 pesetas.... \n\nY casi 20 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, la noche del 29 de noviembre de 2003, en una abarrotada plaza del barrio de Rekalde (Bilbao), las Vulpes se reunieron para celebrar un c\u00e1lido homenaje a Lupe, por el 10\u00ba aniversario de su fallecimiento. Vulpes dieron varios conciertos m\u00e1s y, as\u00ed, en 2005, se animaron a grabar, en condiciones, el \u00e1lbum que no pudieron grabar en su d\u00eda, a causa del escandalo, el boikot y otros asuntos. Para grabar el disco \"Me gusta ser... Vulpes\" (Oihuka, 2005).\n\nSALA EL GARAGE ZUZENEAN (1985)\n\n1.  Nuclear no\n2.  Sexo por la cara\n3.  Anarkia en TV\n4.  Solo punks de plastico\n5.

Just add the yeast right into the bottle of apple juice, apply airlock and let ferment at room temperature for about 4 days. Once fermentation has ceased, just remove the airlock, recap and store the cider in the refrigerator. The starting specific gravity is about 1.050 and the ending specific gravity will be about 1.002, which will yield an ABV of about 5 - 6%, approximately equal to regular beers. If you prefer a slightly sweeter hard cider, with a little fizz, just add a little more fresh apple juice and close the lid tightly and allow it to ferment inside the bottle a little more (watch out for exploding bottles if you added too much new juice!) The finished product will be a little tart, crisp and refreshing, not unlike a champagne and much better than store-bought hard apple ciders.

A turnaround is a chord progression that is used for bringing a chord progression back to the tonic key and start a new progression. Turnarounds are commonly used during the last two bars of a piece and there are tons of different ways of playing it. So today we are going to see only an example in C major, but there are an endless amount of possibilities...\nOk, hope this helps and don\u00b4t forget to come up with your own ideas, which is the best advice for starting to find `your\u00b4 unique sound and style.

Join Kirsten Segler and learn about the Euphorbia and Doronicum.\n\nEuphorbia, or Cushion Spurge, are great hardy plants that are typically evergreen and easily survive the winters. Euphorbia are herbaceous, so the growth will die to the ground, allowing for new growth the next spring season. Like the Christmas Poinsettia (another Euphorbia), where the bracts turn red, this Euphorbia's bracts will turn yellow. They bloom in the spring for about April to May, and are drought resistant.\n\nDoronicum (Leopard's Bane) need half-day sun and half-day shade and are great for your choice of spring bloomers. Their blooms usually last 6 weeks; just dead-head the spent flowers and new buds will push through.\n\n======================\n\nOthers part of the series:\n\nBergenia and Caltha Palustris: http://youtu.be/ksb0KHIG2VY\nDrumstick Primrose and Helleborus: http://youtu.be/gSzZxEpPgiU\nBleeding Heart and Brunnera: http://youtu.be/wxexVO5xmv8\n\n======================\n\nThe Greenery Garden Centre is a family owned and operated business that is open to the public for the four Spring months each year.

Elementa (with a spear) is used to build the stagger, while Thundara (with Chaos's Revenge) is used to quick stagger.

Bleeding Heart: The flower, especially in the bud form, of the Lamprocapnos, a flowering plant of the poppy family, oddly resembles the conventional shape of the heart with e droplet beneath. That is why, it has been given the name, a bleeding heart. The outer petals are bright fuchsia in colour. As the flower blooms further and the outer petals open up, the inner, white parts, often called the \u2018lady in a bath\u2019 become more visible. This plant is found in Siberia, northern China, Korea and Japan.\n9. Parrot Flower: The Impatiens Psittacina is an amazing plant of the balsam family. The flowers are purple and carmine red in colour. When viewed from the sides, the flowers seemingly resemble a parrot in flight. British botanist and explorer, Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, first noted, in a scientific description of the plant in 1901, how its bloom looks like a \u2018flying cockatoo\u2019 and from then on, the name has stuck. This rare plant is found in Thailand, Burma And parts of India.\n8. Ballerina Orchid: These small plants are terrestrial spider orchids that grow singly or in groups in different parts across the island of Australia. The flowers are essentially cream in colour, with maroon markings, and their petals and sepals have dark trichromes. Together, the flower looks like a maiden in white tutus, holding a graceful ballet pose.\n7. Duck Orchid: Caleana is commonly referred to as the Duck Orchid. This is because, the labellum looks just like a flying duck with its wings raised high. The lip, in particular, looks clearly like the beak of a duck. The flower is reddish brown in colour, and in rare cases, it is greenish with dark spots, and a single leaf appears near the base of the stalk. This small terrestrial orchid is found in the Australia, from Queensland to South Australia, and even Tasmania.\n6. Snapdragon and its Skull: The Antirrhinum, found in the rocky areas Europe, America and North Africa, has an interesting flower called the dragon flower or snapdragon. The beautiful flower petals give the impression of the face of a dragon, which, when squeezed, will open and close like the mouth. But, once the petals wither and fall off, only the seed pod is left behind, presenting quite a macabre look, because the seed pod looks like a skull.\n5. Dove Orchid/Holy Ghost Orchid: Peristeria is an orchid that is commonly found to grow across much of South America, along with Panama, Trinidad and Costa Rica. One look inside the pure white flower reveals a structure hidden inside it, which looks like dove. In fact, sitting cosy in the centre within the petals is an entire dove, complete with raised wings with tiny pink dots, and a tiny yellow beak.\n4. Naked Man Orchid: The Orchis italica is often referred to as the Italian orchid, owing to its Mediterranean region where it generally grows in large numbers. But, more commonly, it is known as the naked man orchid. This is because, the amazing flowers of the orchid have petals that look like naked men. The flowers are a combination of bright pink and white in colour, and they are all clustered densely.\n3. Monkey Orchid: The Dracula Simia or the Monkey Orchid is also known as the monkey-like Dracula. This is a rare species of orchids which is found to grow in the cloud forests of south-eastern parts of Ecuador and Peru. The orchid is called so because it has flowers which display an odd arrangement of column, petals and lip that strongly resembles the face of a monkey \u2013 a baboon, to be more specific. The flowers bear the fragrance of a ripe orange.\n2. Hooker\u2019s Lips: While many might consider it an exaggerated description, the Psychotria Elata, also called the Hooker\u2019s Lips or Kissing Lips plant, is absolutely genuine. It exists in the tropical rainforests of Central and Southern Africa. The waxy bract, which is a modified or specialized leaf, associated with the flower, is bright red in colour, and is shaped like the luscious lips of a woman.\n1. Swaddled Babies: The plant grows in the Columbian Andes. The most stunning feature of the plant is its flowers which are large, creamy-white and waxy. Their structure is quite complex, and at a certain stage of opening, they start to look like a baby wrapped in swaddling cloth. Each flower blooms from a single stem from the base of the pseudobulbs.\n\nIMAGE SOURCE: \"GOOGLE SEARCH\"\nSOURCE: http://www.wonderslist.com/10-beautiful-strange-flowers/", "title": "Top 10 Most Beautiful But Strange Flowers", "publishedDate": "2014-11-06T12:27:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "3qO6zSXAwys", "description": "Caju E Castanha - S\u00e3o Paulo X Corinthians", "title": "Caju E Castanha - S\u00e3o Paulo X Corinthians", "publishedDate": "2010-01-15T05:08:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "3qOCps0XDys", "description": "Originally by Sisters of Mercy\nReleased on The Suicide Girls - Black Heart Retrospective (2005)", "title": "Alkaline Trio - Lucretia My Reflection (Sisters of Mercy Cover)", "publishedDate": "2011-08-04T14:49:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "3qOKLIFNIAo", "description": "This is VERY cool and unique misprint on a very playable holo.

The answer is Yes! If you live for 65 years or longer, you would have consumed more than 70,000 meals, and your remarkable body would have disposed of 50 tons of waste. Without your awareness, the physiological functions of your body are affected by the cumulative effects of unhealthy food choices, and as you age, you become more vulnerable to degenerative diseases!\n\nHealth professionals had concluded that good nutrition is the key to good health. Eating well is easy in theory; just choose a selection of foods that supply appropriate amounts of essential nutrients, fiber, antioxidants, energy without excess intake of fat, sugar and salt, for good nutrition.

He is known for his cartoon panel \"Indoor Sports\" and the many words and expressions he added to the language.  He created his first comic strip, Johnny Wise, for the San Francisco Chronicle in 1902. By 1905 he was working in New York City at the New York Journal as a sports writer and cartoonist.  Jack Dempsey described him as \"the greatest authority on boxing.\"In addition to his work as a sports journalist, Dorgan did a humor feature, \"Daffydills\". His dog cartoons, including Judge Rummy, evolved into the strip Silk Hat Harry's Divorce Suit. This was accompanied by a one-panel gag series called Indoor Sports which became his main feature. Dorgan is generally credited with either creating or popularizing such words and expressions as \"dumbbell\" (a stupid person); \"for crying out loud\" (an exclamation of astonishment); \"cat's meow\" and \"cat's pajamas\" (as superlatives); \"applesauce\" (nonsense); \"cheaters'\" (eyeglasses); \"skimmer\" (a hat); \"hard-boiled\" (a tough person); \"drugstore cowboy\" (loafers or ladies' men); \"nickel-nurser\" (a miser); \"as busy as a one-armed paperhanger\" (overworked); and \"Yes, we have no bananas,\" which was turned into a popular song.\n\nIn the New York Times obituary, he was bracketed with George Ade and Ring Lardner as a popularizer of \"a new slang vernacular.\" His obituary also credited him as the originator of \"Twenty-three, Skidoo,\" \"solid ivory,\" \"Dumb Dora,\" \"finale hopper,\" \"Benny\" for hat, and \"dogs'\" for shoes.[1] W. J. Funk, of the Funk and Wagnall's dictionary company, placed Dorgan at the top of the list of the ten \"most fecund makers of American slang.\n\nTad Dorgan died on 2 May, 1929, at his home in Great Neck, Long Island. He had been suffering from heart disease for several years and even though he spent most of that that time bedridden he was able to continue working up to a few days before his death. The end came not long after he came down with pneumonia.\n\nRessources:  UCLA Preserved Silent Animation,  imdb.org, Wikipedia.org\nMusic:  Kevin MacLeod (incompetch.com)  licensed under Creative Commons licence: Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0).", "title": "\"Indoor Sports\"--1920-Thomas \"Tad\" Aloysius Dorgan-A famous cartoon panel,  a  primitive fascination", "publishedDate": "2013-08-08T04:13:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "3qcUpB_J63g", "description": "Specialized Camber 29", "title": "Specialized Camber 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-05-08T01:16:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "3qdBfzLwzec", "description": "Astoria Hotel Thessaloniki Hotel Website: http://emalaysiatravel.net/en/europe/greece/thessaloniki/astoria_hotel.html?CID=1460346  The 3-star Astoria Hotel offers comfort and convenience whether you're on business or holiday in Thessaloniki.

Many people are now enrolling in nutritional schools with courses being offered both within the classroom settings and online. The choice of a nutrition school is therefore an important part in the whole process and there are various factors that should be considered in order to identify the most suitable institution.\n\nWhat should you look for in a holistic nutrition school?\n\nWith the number of schools on the increase, the identification of the right institute is an important step. Below are some of the factors that you should look into before enrolling in a nutrition school.\nTo begin with, you should enroll in a nutrition school that offers courses covering a well rounded span of nutrition courses. When you attend a holistic wellness school, the usual course of study for nutrition courses includes Advanced Anatomy & Physiology, Vitamin Therapies, Drug Free Remedies, Foods to Fight Cancer, Nutrition For Weight Management, Herb-Drug-Vitamin Interactions, etc. as well as Setting Up a Practice as a Natural Healer. This complete package of courses will be a key factor in preparing you for a career that is indeed lucrative and highly beneficial.\nIt is also important to take courses that are geared to training the students in things that have to do with the relationship that exists between food and fitness. This is also an important part of the holistic wellness and lifestyle and this is taught in some of the highly recognized nutrition schools both online and in the classroom setting. It is obvious that there is a strong relationship between the food we eat and the manifestation of things such as moods and illness. This is important for any student to understand this.\nYou should consider an online education due to lower cost and convenience of scheduling. This is important in ensuring that you not only receive quality training but also that your certification is recognizable and will enhance your profile. You should be sure to get a diploma that is recognized and approved by agencies and organizations like, AADP (American Association of Drugless Practitioner), and the American Naturopathic Certification Board, etc.\nSome schools over charge because their marketing cost is high which makes these schools expensive. You need to compare the quality and cost of nutrition schools. The cost will however differ from one institute to the other and therefore it will be wise to research properly in order to get a nutrition school that both offers quality and affordable nutritional education.\nThe online classes are highly accommodating as they assist you to be able to plan your time without taking you away from your other important engagements such as your job and family.\n\nNatural Healing College's courses are reasonably priced and deliver the best education online.\n\nPage Title: How to choose the best nutrition school for holistic nutrition courses and programs\n\nApply for admissions online in a few easy steps\n\nProgram Overview\nhttp://www.naturalhealingcollege.com/kw/nutrition-school.php\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Natural.Healing.College", "title": "Nutrition School | how to become a Nutritionist, Nutritional Consultant or Herbalist?", "publishedDate": "2012-05-31T17:52:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "3qf6hAEp6Wc", "description": "Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/supernpcgaming\nPlanet Minecraft: http://www.planetminecraft.com/member/nicklaz534/\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "title": "The Pedophile: A Minecraft Movie", "publishedDate": "2013-10-10T17:03:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "3qfA-PuWUK8", "description": "Galina Ulanova Ballet Bolshoi Academy last Concert at Rosinka representing a traditional Babushka's dance.

Combining his knowledge of both medicine and science, Dr. Meminger developed a skin treatment system that offered dramatic results to problem skin.  The central feature of Dr. Meminger's technology was the application of electrical currents to treat the skin.  He used this electrical current (commonly known as a galvanic current) to introduce vitamin rich solutions into the skin.\n\nDr. Meminger soon discovered that this combination of electrical current and vitamin rich solutions brought dramatic physical changes to the skin.  Such changes he found helped to cleanse, hydrate, and rejuvenate dermal tissue.  Following Dr. Meminger's discovery, a galvanic treatment machine was designed and developed, now known as Iderm Deep Skin Ionization Process, a proprietary technology owned by Dermaculture, along with a full line of specialized skin care products.\n\nToday, this process is known in the medical field as iontophoresis.

One of the earlier alignments was so dangerous, they referred to is as the \"Devils Elbow\".  That alignment was no longer used after 1941.  Due to having to cut through solid rock to form a new alignment, it was decided that this section of Route 66 should be made a four-lane highway, unheard of for the times.  The cut they made was the deepest ever attempted and referred to afterward as the \"Hooker Cut\" possibly after a nearby town, competing with the Pennsylvania Turnpike's \"Little Panama\" near Bedford for the deepest cut  attempted in highway construction. One of the most scenic drives on Route 66, that was built to carry traffic to and from Fort Leonard Wood during World War II. The first twisting, narrow stretch of Route 66 through Devil's Elbow was obviously not adequate for the many moving men and equipment and the new four lane stretch was completed in 1943. Today, most of this old four-lane is still original and is in very good condition considering its age. Passing through the steep bluffs of the Big Piney River, the Hooker Cut was one of the deepest road cuts in the nation at the time of its construction.\n\nInterestingly, the curbs along this stretch of road are inclined towards the roadway. This was a common building practice at the time, as it was believed that such a design would keep cars from going off the road. However, they soon found out that the curb design actually caused cars to overturn and was soon discontinued.\n This section is easily asscessable and travelled by Rt 66 geeks like myself, but today it was for all intents and purposes, abandoned.  It was bypassed when Interstate 44 was built in the 1960's.  What a great movie set!!!\nLet the arguments begin--was this first or was the PA turnpike the first four lane?  I know, it opened on October 1, 1940 and was continuous, limited access...so perhaps we give a nod to the turnpike.

It took place concomitantly with the Austro-Turkish War of 1787--91.\n\nIn the spring of 1787, Catherine II of Russia made a triumphal procession through New Russia and the annexed Crimea in company with her ally, Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. These events, the rumors about Catherine's Greek Plan and the friction caused by mutual complaints of infringements of the Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca, which had closed the previous war, stirred up public opinion in Constantinople, while the British and French ambassadors lent their unconditional support to the Ottoman war party.\n\nIn 1788, war was declared and the Russian ambassador to the Ottomans, Yakov Bulgakov, was thrown into prison, but Ottoman preparations were inadequate and the moment was ill-chosen, now that Russia and Austria were in alliance, a fact of which the Ottomans became aware only when the horsetails were planted for the campaign. The Ottomans drove back the Austrians from Mehadia and overran the Banat (1789); but in Moldavia, Field Marshal Pyotr Rumyantsev captured Ia\u0219i and Khotyn. After a long winter siege, Ochakov fell to Prince Grigory Potemkin. This news affected the Sultan, Abdul Hamid I, so deeply as to cause his death.\n\nAccordingly, the Treaty of Jassy was signed with Russia on 9 January 1792, recognizing Russia's 1783 annexation of the Crimean Khanate. Yedisan (Odessa and Ochakov) was also ceded to Russia, and the Dniester was made the frontier in Europe, while the Asiatic frontier \u2014 the Kuban River \u2014 remained unchanged. The Ottoman generals were incompetent and the army mutinous; expeditions for the relief of Bender and Akkerman failed, Belgrade was taken by Laudon of Austria, the supposedly impenetrable fortress of Izmail was captured by Suvorov by surprise attacks using combined infantry and artillery, Ushakov shattered the Ottoman fleet at Fidonisi, Tendra, Kerch Strait, and Cape Kaliakra, and the fall of Anapa to Ivan Gudovich in 1791 completed the series of Ottoman disasters.\n\nThe young Sultan Selim III was anxious to restore his country's prestige by a victory before making peace, but the condition of his troops made this hope impossible. On 31 January 1790, Prussia signed an offensive treaty with the Ottoman Empire, but instead of directly joining the war with the Turkish side, Prussia pressed Sweden into war against Russia despite opposition from military officers stationed in Finland. Russia in turn pressed Denmark--Norway into war against Sweden.", "title": "The Ottoman-Russian War Of 1787--92.", "publishedDate": "2014-07-06T12:36:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "3qxtiFwKiuI", "description": "Tonni Nielsen - Semi Rusticated - Grade 5", "title": "Tonni Nielsen - Semi Rusticated - Grade 5", "publishedDate": "2010-09-17T16:30:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "3qy7MJh3YbA", "description": "Blanco ardilla albina.

It is the traditional place of coronation and burial site for English, later British and later still (and currently) monarchs of the Commonwealth realms. The abbey is a Royal Peculiar and briefly held the status of a cathedral from 1540 to 1550.\nWestminster Abbey is a collegiate church governed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, as established by Royal charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1560, which created it as the Collegiate Church of St Peter Westminster and a Royal Peculiar under the personal jurisdiction of the Sovereign. The members of the Chapter are the Dean and four residentiary canons, assisted by the Receiver General and Chapter Clerk. One of the canons is also Rector of St Margaret's Church, Westminster, and often holds also the post of Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons. In addition to the Dean and canons, there are at present two full-time minor canons, one is precentor, and the other is sacrist. The office of Priest Vicar was created in the 1970s for those who assist the minor canons. Together with the clergy and Receiver General and Chapter Clerk, various lay officers constitute the college, including the Organist and Master of the Choristers, the Registrar, the Auditor, the Legal Secretary, the Surveyor of the Fabric, the Head Master of the Choir School, the Keeper of the Muniments and the Clerk of the Works, as well as 12 lay vicars, 10 choristers and the High Steward and High Bailiff. There are also 40 Queen's Scholars who are pupils at Westminster School (the School has its own Governing Body).

Te zien zijn foto's uit de serie Park Portraits van de beroemde Nederlandse fotografe en landschapstekeningen van meesterkunstenaar Claude Lorrain.\n\nRineke Dijkstra\nDe getoonde werken van Rineke Dijkstra (1959) zijn foto's die zij maakte in 2005 en 2006 van jonge mensen in het park. In vergelijking met andere fotoseries van Dijkstra, speelt in deze foto's de omgeving van de geportretteerde kinderen en adolescenten een grote rol. De contactafdrukken die nu voor het eerst tentoongesteld worden, laten het zoekproces van de kunstenaar naar de juiste lichtval, kadrering en positionering zien. Sommige foto's blijken op dezelfde locatie te zijn genomen, maar door een ander licht of standpunt volkomen verschillende resultaten op te leveren.\n\nHet ideale landschap\nDe werkwijze van Rineke Dijkstra doet denken aan de zoektocht naar de ideale verbeelding van het landschap zoals die te zien is in de tekeningen die de 17de-eeuwse landschapschilder Claude Lorrain (1600-1682) maakte in de omgeving van zijn woonplaats Rome.\nClaude Lorrain was eeuwenlang lichtend voorbeeld voor generaties kunstenaars. Tegenwoordig is de weerklank van zijn naam - zeker in Nederland - echter gering buiten een kleine kring van fijnproevers. Toch zijn veel van de principes die ten grondslag liggen aan het werk van Claude Lorrain vandaag de dag nog even geldend voor kunstenaars die het landschap in beeld brengen, zoals Rineke Dijkstra in haar parkfoto's.\nDeze tentoonstelling laat zien welke onverwachte en interessante verbanden er liggen tussen deze twee zo uiteenlopende kunstenaars. De problemen die Rineke Dijkstra tegenkwam bij het maken van haar parkfoto's, blijken bijzonder vergelijkbaar met die van de 17de-eeuwse kunstenaar Claude Lorrain.\n\nTentoonstelling\nDe tentoonstelling toont een tiental parkfoto's van Rineke Dijkstra en zo'n vijftien tekeningen van Claude Lorrain. Aangevuld met contactafdrukken van de fotografe.

Could another cometary outburst be imminent?\n\nENKI:\nEven more interestingly, a series of seven rays along the outside of that new crop picture at Poirino are written in eight-bit ASCII code, and seem to identify the crop artist as \"Ea\" or \"Enki\" who was a tall blond extra-terrestrial god in ancient Sumeria. According to ancient legends, he and Innanna created modern humans by hybridizing sperm from the male gods with eggs taken from local aboriginals, already living on Earth tens of thousands of years ago.\nThe precise ASCII code which was drawn at Poirino goes as follows, reading clockwise around its large seven-pointed star:\n 01000101 E\n 01100001 a\n 01000101 E\n 01101110 n\n 01101011 k\n 01101001 i\n 00100000 space\n That amazing crop picture also shows a series of \"stars\" around its seven edges, but it is not clear whether those symbols represent astronomical images around an exploding comet (as for Lane End Down 2005), or rather some clever mathematical code? Counting each set of \"stars\" individually, we seem to see \"5.334444\u2033.\n Last summer in 2010 at Poirino, the precise number of \"stars\" in a similar crop picture specified the famous equation E = mc2 in decimal ASCII code.\n\n-For More Exclusive Information on UFO\n\nPLAYLISTS CROP CIRCLE 2013: http://areazone51ufos.blogspot.be/p/crop-circle-2013.html\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/EriGIA007\nhttp://www.youtube.com/UFOvni2012\nhttp://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/pages/EriGIA007-UFO-2012-MAYA/306418886046269\n\nThanks For Watching My Friends\n\n\u2605\u3002\uff3c\uff5c\uff0f\u3002\u2605\n--- B\u0404 \u013f\u01a0\u0194\u0404 -- \n---- P\u20ac\u2606C\u0404 ---\n\u2605\u3002\uff0f\uff5c\uff3c\u3002\u2605", "title": "Special Analysis: Ea Enki ASCII code was drawn in Crop Circle at Poirino, Italy, June 2011", "publishedDate": "2013-06-26T09:34:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "3rZIkNR9mzM", "description": "Das Hotel THB Sur Mallorca in Col\u00f2nia Sant Jordi: Ab-in-den-Urlaub.de hat per Video einen Blick hinter die Kulissen geworfen.\nhttp://www.ab-in-den-urlaub.de/Hotel,THB+Sur+Mallorca,hot_196562.html", "title": "Hotelvideo THB Sur Mallorca, Mallorca, Col\u00f2nia Sant Jordi", "publishedDate": "2014-04-07T14:27:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "3r_5QMNKIfI", "description": "yeah baby, RFM played it...\nwww.maddogmoreti.com", "title": "Maddog Moreti & Scid Dabeatsky (Ex-Cops/ NYPD) 2nd Airtime French Radio", "publishedDate": "2011-09-08T10:37:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "3r_C1O0lEFc", "description": "How to make adas polo (lentils rice) at home in easy steps.

Exceptions include pelagic cucumbers and the species Rynkatropa pawsoni, which has a commensal relationship with deep-sea anglerfish.\n*  Crinoids, also known as \"sea lilies\" or \"feather-stars\", are marine animals that make up the class Crinoidea of the echinoderms (phylum Echinodermata).\n They live both in shallow water and in depths as great as 6000 meters. \n There are only a few hundred known modern forms, but crinoids were much more numerous both in species and numbers in the past.\n\n\u0647\u064a \u0632\u0646\u0628\u0642\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631 ,\u062a\u0646\u062a\u0645\u064a \u0644\u0642\u0628\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0644\u062f \u0634\u0648\u0643\u064a\u0627\u062a , \u062a\u0639\u064a\u0634 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0636\u062d\u0644\u0629 , \u0642\u062f \u064a\u0628\u0644\u063a \u0623\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0639\u0645\u0642 \u062a\u0635\u0644\u0647 6000 \u0645\u062a\u0631.\n\u064a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0636\u0639 \u0645\u0626\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0639 , \u0648\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0623\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0642\u0631\u0636 \u0648\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0641\u0649 \u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0627\u064b . \n\n*\u062e\u064a\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631 : \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631 (sea cucumbers) \u0647\u0648 \u0646\u0648\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062c\u0633\u0645\u0647 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0643\u062a\u0646\u0632 \u0642\u062f \u064a\u0634\u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0627\u0631. \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u064a\u0646\u062a\u0645\u064a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0634\u0648\u0643\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0644\u062f \u062a\u0633\u0645\u0649 \u0642\u0646\u0641\u0630\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0644\u062f. \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0646\u0641\u062f\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0644\u062f \u062a\u0646\u0645\u0648 \u0623\u0634\u0648\u0627\u0643\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0633\u0637\u062d\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631 \u0641\u0623\u0634\u0648\u0627\u0643\u0647 \u0645\u062f\u0641\u0648\u0646\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0642 \u062c\u0644\u062f\u0647. \u0648\u064a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u0646\u062d\u0648 500 \u0646\u0648\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0634\u062a\u0649 \u0645\u062d\u064a\u0637\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0648\u0641\u064a \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0642.\n\n\u0648\u064a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u0641\u0645 \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u062d\u062f \u0637\u0631\u0641\u064a \u062c\u0633\u0645\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0645\u062d\u0627\u0637 \u0628\u0642\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0639\u0627\u0631 \u0639\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0642\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0639\u0627\u0631 \u0639\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u0647\u064a \u062a\u0642\u0648\u0645 \u0628\u0648\u0638\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u064a\u062f\u064a\u060c \u0625\u0630 \u062a\u0637\u0648\u0644 \u0648\u062a\u0642\u0635\u0631 \u0641\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0636 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0630\u0627\u0621 \u0648\u062a\u0623\u062a\u064a \u0628\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0645. \u0648\u064a\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0637\u0631\u062d \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0623\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0635\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0647 \u0623\u0639\u062f\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u0647 . \u062b\u0645 \u062a\u0646\u0645\u0648 \u0644\u0647 \u0623\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 .", "title": "\u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0652 (Holothurode) \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0646\u0628\u0642\u064a\u0627\u062a\u064f (Crinoidea -

In other words, they can convert electricity into mechanical energy and vice versa. And if for example we disconnect the power of the engine and close it at a low resistance, the counter-electromotive force in the closed circuit of the armature winding will generate large current, which will create a braking moment in the engine, directed against its rotation, so that the engine will shut down quickly. This effect is used for electric braking, most often on electric transport. In a usual mode a train gets its energy from an overhead system, the electric engine accelerates the train set. But when a train needs to be slowed down or when there is a movement down the slope, it involves an electric braking mode. The train set not only reduces speed but also the engine becomes a generator and produces a current that is converted into heat energy in resistors, charges the battery or returns to the overhead system. For the engine to switch from the traction motor to the generator mode the EMF in the armature winding has to become higher than the applied voltage, i.e. the voltage in the overhead system. There are several types of electric braking depending on the method of conversion of the received energy. The two main types are rheostat and regenerative braking. When rheostat braking is applied the generated energy is absorbed on the rolling stock itself in brake rheostats, creating an additional braking torque on the machine shaft. Upon this the engine is disconnected from the overhead system and the ends of the armature winding or field winding switch. The advantage of this method is that the process does not depend on voltage. The electricity consumer is on the vehicle. The second type of braking is regenerative braking. In this case the generated energy is returned to the overhead system. This energy is consumed by electric locomotives that are located in the same area and are working in traction mode. If there are no electric locomotives or they need less energy than there is regenerated, then the so-called regeneration excess energy is sent to the grid via inverters converting direct current to alternating three-phase current which are installed at the traction substation.

Stay tuned. In the meantime, follow on twitter @OpGabon, @GabonIshere, @Fax1g, @AnonymousFiveO and @GeorgieBC for information.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGabon, an oil rich country, located in Central Africa, is blessed with natural resources. But how could one comprehend that over 80% of the 1.5 million Gabonese live below the poverty line, where the majority make less than $US 2 per day, while the GDP per capita estimate at more than 17,000 US dollars, which is one of the highest in Africa?\n \nThe answer is clear and simple: government corruption and dictatorship!\n \nIn fact, one family, the Bongo, has been ruling the country, with an iron fist, for more than 46 years. After a contested fraudulent election, Ali Bongo Ondimba succeeded his father Omar Bongo, who died in 2009, after being in power for 42 years. Ali Bongo came into power with blood on his hands after people were killed for protesting against his electoral coup.\n \nThe Bongo family for decades has been taking bribes, stealing hundreds of millions of dollars, and presiding over a system rife with corruption, embezzlements and ritual killings. According to Yahoo Finance, Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba, along with his associates, pocketed 25% of Gabon's GDP in last 3 years. He is said to be worth over $US 1 billion.\n \nDespite these proven allegations, presidents and prime ministers of so-called developed and democratic countries haven't stopped inviting Ali Bongo: U.S. President Barack Obama; UK's Prime Minister David Cameron; Australia's Prime Minister Julie Gillard; Prince Charles and his sons of UK; Sarkozy and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France; etc. Ex-US Ambassador to Gabon, Eric Benjaminson, became a strong advocate of Ali Bongo Ondimba, and he even insulted people of Gabon not supporting Ali Bongo.  And the US just inaugurated a brand new and oversized embassy; a big bunker in a tiny country like Gabon. Why? Because oil is abundant in Central Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Congo, Cameroon, Chad, CAR and most importantly, Gabon. Ironically, all of these countries are controlled by dictators.\n \nGabon is your typical kleptocracy: the country is rich but the people are so poor that families are forced to pick from the garbage in landfills to eat, of course except for the very few, like Ali Bongo and his family, who control all resources along with their friends from abroad.\n \nOn top of that, Gabon is a country where children and adults are being killed for their organs, which are eaten by politicians during rituals killings to obtain money, power, political success, youth, longevity and more. Ali Bongo and his wife Sylvia's mock march on last May 11 won't change that soon.\n \nThis is clearly unacceptable.\n \nCitizens of the world have a responsibility with respect to human dignity, and anyone against tyranny and corruption cannot sit and watch this happening any longer.\n \nCurrently some people try to profit from the dictatorship of Ali Bongo and get the grip on Gabon resources. For the \u00abNew York Forum Africa\u00bb, Richard Attias and his rich friends are gathering in Libreville this weekend for a forum that is supposed to bring prosperity to Gabon and Africa. We know the only prosperity that will come up is their own with personal enrichment. This is also a way for Richard Attias to help his dictator friends in Africa to avoid an \u00abAfrican spring\u00bb, like the ones that brought fundamental change in Tunisia and Egypt.\n \nWe can no longer accept Ali Bongo's dictatorship and abuse on Gabon's people and its resources. Just like we took actions towards the ritual killings (April 13 & May 11), Anonymous is standing up with the people of Gabon once again, but this time against the corrupt regime of Ali Bongo and family.\n \nThis is a special message to Ali Bongo and his entire regime. Anonymous is aware of your wrongdoings, corruption and profligacy. We will raise awareness of your ill-mannered behavior in every parts of the world, and help bring justice to the Gabonese people!\n \nWe Are Anonymous.\nWe Are Everywhere.\nWe Are the Voice of the Voiceless.\nWe Are Legion.\nTyrants of the World,\nExpect Us!\n \n#OpGabon is Re-Engaged\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMusic from the Inception Soundtrack (Music from the Motion Picture) by Hans Zimmer.

Certain types of hematite or iron oxide rich clay, especially Armenian bole has been used in gilding. Hematite is also used in art such as intaglio engraved gems. Hematine is a synthetic material sold as magnetic hematite.[6]\n\n Occasionally granite and ultrapotassic igneous rocks segregate magnetite crystals and form masses of magnetite suitable for economic concentration. A few iron ore deposits, notably in Chile, are formed from volcanic flows containing significant accumulations of magnetite phenocrysts. Chilean magnetite iron ore deposits within the Atacama Desert have also formed alluvial accumulations of magnetite in streams leading from these volcanic formations.\n\n In , leading Pilbara based iron ore miners - Rio, BHP and FMG - all announced significant capital investment in the development of existing and new mines and associated infrastructure (rail and port). Collectively this would amount to the production of 1,000 million tonnes per year (Mt/y) by . Practically that would require a doubling of production capacity from a current production level of 470 Mt/y to 1,000 Mt/y (an increase of 530 Mt/y). These figures are based on the current production rates of Rio 220 Mt/y, BHP 180 Mt/y, FMG 55 Mt/y and Other 15 Mt/y increasing to Rio 353 Mt/y, BHP 356 Mt/y, FMG 155 Mt/y and Other 140 Mt/y (the latter 140 Mt/y is based on planned production from recent industry entrants Hancock, Atlas and Brockman through Port Hedland and API and others through the proposed Port of Anketell).\n\n Mouse drag1 - LMB Manipulate Structure drag2 - RMB Resize/Rotate Keyboard S - Stereo Pair on/off H - Help Screen I - Data Info A - Atoms On/Off P - Polyhedra On/Off B - Bonds On/Off Help on Above\n\n SIDERITE ORES.
