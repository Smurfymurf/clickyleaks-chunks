Is a scientific theory no different to the theory that Elvis is still alive? Jim Al-Khalili puts the record straight.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http://bit.ly/RiSubscRibe\n\nThere\u2019s an important difference between a scientific theory and the fanciful theories of an imaginative raconteur, and this quirk of semantics can lead to an all-too-common misconception. In general conversation, a \u2018theory\u2019 might simply mean a guess. But a scientific theory respects a somewhat stricter set of requirements. When scientists discuss theories, they are designed as comprehensive explanations for things we observe in nature. They\u2019re founded on strong evidence and provide ways to make real-world predictions that can be tested.\n\nWhile scientific theories aren\u2019t necessarily all accurate or true, they shouldn\u2019t be belittled by their name alone. The theory of natural selection, quantum theory, the theory of general relativity and the germ theory of disease aren\u2019t \u2018just theories\u2019. They\u2019re structured explanations of the world around us, and the very foundation of science itself.\n\nRead the blog post to find out more: http://www.rigb.org/blog/2014/november/its-just-a-theory\n\n\nWatch more science videos on the Ri Channel http://richannel.org\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ri_science\nand Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/royalinstitution\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http://richannel.org/newsletter", "title": "Why science is NOT 'Just a Theory'", "publishedDate": "2014-11-12T15:08:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "1uzuybdYu7Q", "description": "How to use the crank cocking device.

Heart attacks or myocardial infarction (MI) leaves irreparable damage on your heart muscles. \nThe heart pumps nutrition and energy throughout our entire body by blood and blood vessels. The heart is supplied with constant energy in the form of nutrients and oxygen coming from the blood delivered via coronary arteries. However, because of bad nutrition or general lack of a healthy lifestyle, these arteries can be blocked, and blood flow is prevented, causing heart muscles to starve of valuable nutrients. \nThe medical term for this condition is ischemia and is usually accompanied by angina -- chest discomfort.  When the blockage of coronary arteries worsens and becomes severe, the muscle affected dies; this is called a heart attack or myocardial infarction. \nHowever, modern medicine has ways of reducing the risks, treating the illness and preventing these attacks from occurring or recurring. Such medication includes beta-blockers, used to decrease blood pressure and heart rate, oxygen that is administered via facemasks or nose plugs. \nAspirin and Plavix (clopidogrel) are platelet blockers that are usually administered to those suffering from a heart attack. Both are taken orally. Intravenous (IV) injections include heparin, lovenox and 2B3A and their tasks is to inhibit further clotting and prevent the blockage from worsening. \nFurther, statin (cholesterol pill) is given to stabilize the blockage. In severe cases of chest pain, nitroglycerine can be used in its various forms: dissolving pill under the tongue, IV or paste on the chest. Its purpose is to dilate the arteries enabling easier blood flow thus enhancing the heart function. Morphine is used to alleviate discomfort and reduce possible anxiety as people have a hard time dealing with heart attacks. \nHowever, all of these are used to stabilize a blockage but are not very affective in removal of an already formed one. T-PA (tissue plasminogen activator) and related medicine is used to clear the blockage and allow normal blood flow. A cardiologist can also perform a stent procedure using a balloon. \nNevertheless, the most effective way of handling heart attacks is reducing the risk of ever getting one. Most physicians will advise you to incorporate exercise at least 2.5 hours per week, maintain a healthy weight, remove smoking completely and implement a healthy diet with abundance of fruits and vegetables. This combination alone can help you reduce the risks by 35%. \nWhat's more, implementation of a healthier lifestyle with the above-mentioned changes can help you reduce heart attack related issues even late in your 50s and 60s. Therefore, it is never late to change the way you eat, exercise, drink and live. It could mean a difference between life and death.", "title": "A Heart to Health Talk \u2502 AJHWW.com", "publishedDate": "2014-04-08T16:46:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "1v04FFXeH70", "description": "", "title": "BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD DEUS \"SUDS & SODA\" MUSIC VIDEO", "publishedDate": "2013-12-28T13:02:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1v0FFNdH1d0", "description": "Benjam\u00edn Vicu\u00f1a y Carolina \"Pampita\" Ardoha\u00edn, despidieron esta tarde a Blanca, su hija mayor, que falleci\u00f3 ayer a causa de una neumon\u00eda hemorr\u00e1gica.

With Chinese medicine, we have an opportunity to prevent diseases before they happen by rebalancing the animal. If we can rebalance the animal, we can restore health, says holistic veterinarian, Dr. Pam Scerba.Dr. Scerba practices an integrative approach to veterinary medicine and specializes in alternative and complementary care for animals.  She chooses the most appropriate medicine for that patient with input from the pet's owner.Holistic medicine is looking at and treating the animal as a whole rather than looking at each symptom individually.  When the season changes, the patterns in the animal can also change.  Therefore, so will the treatments such as acupuncture points and herbal medicines.The Holistic Veterinary Center provides:-Acupuncture-Biopuncture-Spinal adjustments-Laser therapy-Herbal medicines-Nutritional supplements-Massage therapyDr. Scerba specializes in diagnosing acute and chronic diseases, trauma injuries and pain management and she does this by using traditional Chinese methods, commonly used on humans.It's becoming more common because people want a more natural approach. Western medicine is very good for those acute problems, especially, says Scerba.Dr. Scerba says the biggest challenge is when the supplement companies stop distributing their products that work because of pressure from the FDA and pharmaceutical companies.CBS6 met a bunch of pets Tuesday morning. Winston has cancer, and uses acupuncture to help with his disease, while Henry is a 7-year-old Doberman who suffers from Wobblers disease. Henry also uses acupuncture, and his owner Joanie says she has seen tremendous improvements. Tator-Tot is a 15-year-old toy poodle mix with severe congestive heart failure, and she uses laser therapy to help with her collapsing trachea. Her family member, Nea is a 7-year-old blind cat with hepatic lipidosis, and acupuncture saved her life. Nea at one point was losing a lot of weight, and not eating, after her first acupuncture treatment, she started to eat again.Finally, CBS6 met Manny, a 2-year-old Rhodesian ridge-back/hound mix. Manny had a spinal adjustment, which allows him to move the way a dog should when walking and running.I love giving people hope, and I love helping animals, adds Scerba.If you would like more information about holistic pet care with Dr. Scerba click here.", "title": "Growing trend: Acupuncture for pets!", "publishedDate": "2013-07-19T04:27:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "1v2n3jOEYBY", "description": "Sunday September 9 2012.Eagles at Brown's.Richardson finally gets room to move and Coleman pays the price.", "title": "Trent Richardson smashes Kurt Coleman", "publishedDate": "2012-09-09T18:59:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "1v3gdDVcK9A", "description": "\u0398\u03b7\u03bb\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\nLaryngeal papillomatosis in a 30 year old man", "title": "\u03b8\u03b7\u03bb\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1, laryngeal papillomas", "publishedDate": "2013-12-23T17:31:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "1v3ucerKJSc", "description": "Cataloged Antique Auction Saturday, June 15th 2013 -- Pairpoint  Amber Glass Console Set\n\n3 Pc.

Prior to cooking the ramen, prepare your eggs by hard boiling them. Place your eggs in a pot and cover them with water so that there's a good inch or two above them. Bring the pot of water to a full boil, then remove the pot from the heat and cover it. Let it stand for 12-15 minutes. After, take the eggs out and place them in a bowl with cold water for another 3-5 minutes. Then remove the shells carefully. Cut these in half! Cut your green onions and slice your ham as thick or as thin as you'd like it. We found all these ingredients at our local grocery store.\n\nAs for the ramen, choose whichever flavor you like best! We believe the ramen they use in the movie is Nissin Chicken Flavored Ramen. The instructions are typically very similar. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add it to your ramen in a bowl, or alternatively cook it in the pot of water. To make it movie authentic, we cooked ours in a reheatable bowl. Cover the top and let the ingredients cook for three minutes. Place the ham, hard boiled egg, and green onions inside and let it cook for a little longer. Then serve!

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "The Duel by Eugene Field", "publishedDate": "2014-02-15T23:17:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "1vAOp_hSOv8", "description": "I love this game so much, haha.

This allows farmers to save their seeds for a time when this commodity has a higher market value. This allows for safe storage of the cowpeas without the use of pesticides. In the video, which can be used on smart phones, we describe the steps needed for hermetically sealing cowpea seeds in a series of plastic bags.

He believes that at the heart of this integration lies the fundamental tension between reliability and validity. \nThe first part of Martin's presentation defines the differences between reliability and validity, setting a foreground for the implementation of both into the world of design and business. \nReliability, according to Martin, gives the same answer each time and is based on past events. Whereas validity answers a question that is being asked dependant on objectives and bias. \nReliability and validity trade off against each other. If something is more reliable then it sacrifices validity and when something is more valid it sacrifices reliability. This is the fundamental tension between design and business, says Martin.\nMartin believes that business people and designers have a different orientation towards reliability and validity. \"Business people want more reliability in order for producing a consistent outcome and to feel safe, whereas designers want more validity in order to have the freedom to produce something innovative and wonderful\", says Martin. This different view then becomes the way people view the world and what they are pursuing. \nThe second part of Martin's presentation focuses on five steps designers can take to better manage what they wish to accomplish. In parallel, Martin also highlights five steps business people can take to work alongside designers in a more efficient and productive way. \nWhat designers can do to design in hostile territories: \n1. Take \"design-unfriendliness\" as a design challenge. \n2. Empathise with \"design-unfriendly\" elements.\n3. Speak the language of reliability.\n4. Use analogies and stories.\n5. Bite off as little apiece as possible to generate proof.\nWhat business people can do to work better with designers:\n1. Take inattention to reliability as a management challenge.\n2. Empathise with the \"reliability-unfriendly\" elements.\n3. Speak the language of validity.\n4. Share data and reasoning, not conclusions.\n5. Bite off as big apiece as possible to give innovation a chance. \nThese steps are fundamentally important for both designers and business people. Martin believes that if a business never incorporates validity and a possible change in the future then the business will eventually come to a halt, as there is no innovation present. At the same time if there is no reliability for designers they will not be able to design the most efficient model for the business, as they will not understand its structure and core elements.\nThe best business people and the best designers are the ones who understand the other side, says Martin. \n\nView more inspiring videos like this one at http://www.designindaba.com/video \n\nDesignindaba.com hosts hundreds of videos of speaker presentations and interviews and world design news.

There are around 340 species worldwide, found mainly in the tropics. There are 126 species of parrots and macaws in the Neotropics, of which 49 are found in Peru.\n\nCONSERVATION\n*Status:\n42 species (around 30%) of Neotropical parrot species are thought to be at risk of extinction, with many more species in decline. There are 8 threatened species in Peru, and the ranges of many more have been severely reduced in the last 100 years. Many smaller parakeets do well and are frequently seen, but macaws are all under threat, since they breed slowly and prefer undisturbed forest away from humans so can't withstand human encroachment and exploitation. As people move further into the forests, parrots and macaws could disappear in the next 20-30 years from all but the biggest parks like Manu National Park.\n\n*Threats:\nAs with many species, a big threat to parrots today is habitat loss to farming and development, meaning loss of their homes, nest sites and feeding places. Some species are also killed for food, feathers, or to protect crops. \nProbably the biggest threat though is the taking of wild parrots, particularly macaws, for the pet trade. There are records of parrots being kept as pets dating as far back as 400BC in ancient Greece. They are popular pets since they are bright, colourful, affectionate, intelligent, and have individual personalities, but the large macaws in particular can make bad pets, needing constant attention and stimulation, being very noisy and destructive, and often outliving their owners.  Export of parrots became illegal in Peru in 1973 and is now illegal in many countries, but smuggling is still a big problem. For example, in the United States it is estimated that parrot species make up about 25% of all illegal trade in wild birds. Smuggled birds are hidden in small boxes and crates and many die on the journey.\nThere are several problems associated with the trade in wild parrots. Firstly, and most obviously, it involves a lot of cruelty, taking chicks away from their parents and transporting them often in terrible conditions to what is arguably not a happy life for a wild bird. It is also very wasteful; for every bird that reaches the marketplace, another 20 to 50 may die. Finally, and most seriously, to get the young birds, trees are cut down to reach the nest. Many chicks die in the fall, and the parents often won't breed again that year. Also, it means the loss of nest sites, which as I already mentioned is already a limiting factor in the reproduction of many species. Macaws are the hardest hit by the pet trade, since they have low reproductive rates and are greatly affected by the loss of nest sites, so populations take a long time to recover.\n\nREMEMBER: FOR EVERY WILD ANIMAL YOU FIND IN A PET STORE THERE WERE 10 INDIVIDUALS DEAD DURING THE PROCESS OF THE ILLEGAL PET TRADE, DON'T BE PART OF THE PROBLEM, BE PART OF THE SOLUTION!!", "title": "White Bellied Parrots - Pionites leucogaster", "publishedDate": "2011-11-30T19:30:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "1vGx_IEXCB8", "description": "", "title": "MVI 7648", "publishedDate": "2013-10-27T03:23:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "1vH7L0S8Bjg", "description": "Our buddy called Apple customer service about his iPhone 4 reception crapping out.

A once beautiful, nationally recognized mall for its design; opened in 1975 which would later come to a sharp decline in 2007 and close indefinitely in 2008. \n\nWhat once stood as a magnificent piece of architecture, including the center of the structure known as The Court of the Twelve Trees has now been thrown to ruins throughout the past 4 years.\n\nThis mall housed stores such as O'neil's, Pretzel Time, and JCPenny (Which still oddly stands to this day).\n\nWithin its walls, it featured unique light structures beyond its also unique decorations and fountain surrounded by large trees and beautiful foliage. A bubble elevator to get shoppers up and down as well as escalators and stairs. The greenhouse-esque skylight covering the entire center brings the outside in, surrounded by 4 corridors which used to house the many shops.\n\nBroken windows, a few trashed shopping carts, piles upon piles of glass, decay, rotted foliage, security office porno magazines (yeah, really), and a destroyed skeleton of what was once a fountain is all that now remains of this structure.\n\nBelow I will link 2 videos to give you even more history on this mall, as well as include the Wiki article.\n\nThis first video gives you a bit more on the history and some old photos of when it was fresh and new.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3g3Xw5Id0A&NR=1&feature=endscreen\n\n  \nThis second video is one that somebody filmed in 2009 only a year after the closing of the mall. Since 2009 the mall has now decayed and been much more destroyed.

When the dust settles, some 40 new shops and restaurants will be opening along the Promenade.\"\n\nRolling Acres Mall is a retail mall located in the Rolling Acres area of Akron, Ohio, United States. Built in 1975 and expanded several times in its history, it once comprised more than 140 stores, including five anchor stores, a movie theater and a food court. The mall was closed off in 2008, save for the only two anchors still in operation, Sears and JCPenney Outlet. However, in January 2011, Sears Holdings announced the Sears store would close by April 2011. In January 2011, JCPenney announced they would close all outlet stores including the Rolling Acres store. In October 2011, an independent company purchased all of JCPenney's Outlet Stores with plans to rename them and continue to operate them.\n\nRolling Acres Mall was developed by Forest City Enterprises. It opened in Akron, Ohio with Sears and 21 stores on August 6, 1975, and had more than 50 stores by year's end. JCPenney opened a year later as a second anchor. A new wing, called the Court of Aquarius, was added in 1977, including a large aquarium (which was later removed) and a third anchor store, Montgomery Ward. Further expansion in 1978 comprised a new, two-story wing called the Promenade, comprising a food court called \"Prom-N-Eat\" and local chain O'Neil's as a fourth anchor.\n\nA mall-wide renovation was begun, replacing its original earth tones with pastel colors. Two of the anchors would change in the 1980s as well: Montgomery Ward closed in 1986 and was replaced with Higbee's (another local chain), and O'Neil's was merged to May Company Ohio in 1989.\n\nThe rest of the Wiki article can be found below.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Acres_Mall", "title": "Abandoned Rolling Acres Mall, Akron 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-10-28T02:38:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "1vd4b3h6ylg", "description": "Brake Dance by RC JAY\nKing of Kings Entertainment", "title": "King of Kings Urban dance", "publishedDate": "2014-04-10T21:59:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "1vdAi4N7qHQ", "description": "College of Charleston biology professor Andrew Clark explains why baseballs are like sharks -- and why shark skin could be used as leather on a baseball.

Ethnically, three main groups have to be distinguished, each speaking a Bantu language: the Ovimbundu who represent 37% of the population, the Northern Mbundu people with 25%, and the Bakongo 13%. Other numerically important groups include the closely interrelated Chokwe and Lunda, the Ganguela and Nhaneca-Humbe, in both cases classification terms which stand for a variety of small groups, the Ovambo, the Herero, the Xindonga and scattered residual groups of Khoisan. In addition, mixed race people amount to about 2%, with a small population of whites, mainly ethnically Portuguese are Roman Catholic, the remaining ones comprising members of traditional Protestant churches as well as of new, often Pentecostal communities. Only 1 - 2% are Muslims - generally immmigrants from other African countries. Traditional indigenous religions are practized by a very small minority, generally in peripheral rural societies; however, some traditional beliefs are held by a substantial number of Christians.", "title": "Demographics of Angola", "publishedDate": "2013-09-16T23:10:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "1vpwMudCImc", "description": "LINKS!\n\nSoul Collector:\nhttp://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58166/?\n\n\n-----------------------Music and Sound Effects------------------------------\n\n\nAll sound effects were also provided by AudioMicro ( Link Below ) \nRoyalty Free Music By Audiomicro : http://audiomicro.com/royalty-free-music\n\n\n-----------------------------------Contact Me----------------------------------------\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheRealYTMCD\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed, that means you liked it :D", "title": "Soul Collector - The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim - Mod Spotlight", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T22:31:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "1vqWf4Kbwlw", "description": "", "title": "negrush ace @de_train", "publishedDate": "2012-03-24T21:58:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "1vqvLz6v20s", "description": "Bill Wallace was in a lighthearted mood when we ran into him at a seminar in 1993.\n\nHis mood ran straight into his demo that night.

There has been a lot of research into the best way to resuscitate a patient and the results of that have been built into the HeartSine\u00ae PAD500P guidance.\n\nThe HeartSine\u00ae PAD500P uses an Impedance Cardiogram (ICG) to assess how good the CPR is - are the compressions fast enough? Hard enough? The Impedance Cardiogram (ICG) measures Impedance changes in blood volume in the chest cavity which determines effective CPR. \n\nSince the blood flow is related to how fast the compressions are applied as well as how hard, the PAD 500P can guide you on both - for example - 'push faster, good compressions' means thecompressions are too slow but the pressure is good.Likewise, 'push harder' means more pressure is needed before concerning yourself with the speed. The simple objective is to ensure that the green indicators are on during CPR with the voice prompting 'good compressions\u2019. One amber light means that either CPR is not being applied at all, or it is too gentle and too slow. All amber lightsshowing mean you are not applying enough pressure. All lights on mean you\u201a are pushing hard enough. The aural clicks will help you keep time. \n\nHowever, if good CPR is to be achieved at all, it is really important that the electrodes and the hands are placed correctly as the device cannot remove the need for CPR training. The electrodes should be replaced by the Apex - underneath their left arm at the bottom of the ribcage, and the sternum - over the heart itself. Hands must be clasped and placed two fingers up from the bottom of the centre of the rib cage. Hands must not touch the electrodes. For this reason, HeartSine\u00ae strongly advises you to take a short training course on CPR which Vivomed can also supply as part of the purchase of a HeartSine AED.\n\nPlease note, this is a UK/Ireland specification model and adheres to the MHRA and IMB guidelines.", "title": "How to use a HeartSine Samaritan PAD 500P Defibrillator (AED) - www.Vivomed.com - AED Instructions", "publishedDate": "2014-09-18T12:46:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "1vrtYC5GKaI", "description": "Cannonball Jellyfish filmed 2-4-07 at the mouth of the St. Johns river.", "title": "Stomolophus meleagris Cannonball Jellyfish", "publishedDate": "2007-02-05T00:27:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "1vs55Z7t7bk", "description": "THE ACTUAL CLIP, NO POOPS AND SHIT\nDidi: It's 4 o'clock in the morning, why on earth are you making chocolate pudding?\nStu: Because I've lost control of my life\n\nI don't own anything.", "title": "Stu making chocolate pudding at 4am", "publishedDate": "2010-05-11T12:37:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "1vsCHN46918", "description": "[2007] Juan Luis Guerra - La Llave De Mi Coraz\u00f3n\nhttp://img143.imageshack.us/img143/678/juanluisguerralallavede.jpg\n01.

They include putting the fish mouth under running water and making the gills move with your finger. So I DON'T RECOMMEND ANY OF THOSE METHODS. [I can't bold so I use caps. I don't mean to yell at anyone.])\n\nCauses:\n-------------\nThe causes of difficulty to breath can be one of the following:\n1. high ammonia and very dirty water\n2. out of water for too long\n3. high chlorine present in water\n4. too long in shipping bags \n5. lack of water circulation in overcrowded tank.\n6. very high temperature in water (too little dissolved oxygen)\n\nThe symptoms of suffocation:\n--------------------------------------------\n1. the fish won't move or swim\n2. the fish rarely breath or breath very irregular or barely move its mouth to breath\n3. the fish color soften or colored intensified \n4. the fish turn side ways or sit at the bottom or stay near the surface. \n5. the fish gills is over run with mucus essencially suffocating the fish to death.\n6. the fish gills are burnt by chemicals\n7. the fish gills is covered in thick white chlorine \n\nIf you see the fish in either of those states, the fish literally have less than 15 minutes to live. \n\nBut if you follow the GOLDFISH emergency CPR here, you will save them and bring them back to life. \n\nHow do you do it?\n---------------------------\nYou will need the following:\n1. a container shown in video\n2. clean de-chlorinated water fill to half the height of the container\n3. an air stone and air pipe \n4. an oxygen container\n5. plastic clingy wraps\n6. big clear adhesive tape (shipping tapes are perfect)\n\nInstruction:\n--------------\n1. After dechlorinated water is put in the container, add the fish that are dying.\n2. put the air stone connected to oxygen container in to the water\n3. assemble the oxygen supply as shown in the video and adjust the air bubbles coming out of the air stone.\n4. seal wrap the top of the contain with clingy plastic wrap as shown in the video\n5. seal the clingy wrap with adhesive tape (I use clear shipping tapes)\n\nFor the first 5 minutes adjust the oxygen valve so the air come out a bit strong. After that adjust the valve to make is softer. Look at the video. \n\nLeave it like that for at least 2 hours. Check on the fish regularly and adjust the oxygen flow as needed. You should see the fish starting to swim and breath normally after 2 hours.

It was destined for the collegiate church of St. Blaise, founded in 1030 to serve as the couple's burial place. According to the prescriptions of the Seventh Ecumenical Council of Nicaea of 787, every consecrated altar was to contain sacred relics. The portable altar of Countess Gertrude was no exception. Of the various relics listed in the inventory of 1482, those of Sts. Hermes, Bartholomew, Vincent, Adelheid, Gertrude, Marcian, and others are still preserved today. An accompanying cedula, or parchment strip with an identifying inscription, suggests that the bag used to contain relics of the arm of one of the Twelve Apostles, namely that of St. Bartholomew. According to early Christian tradition, St. Bartholomew was flayed alive and beheaded, which may explain the presence of soft tissue (rather than bone) and its identification as the \"arm\" (brachium) of the apostle. Together with other precious relics, some of which were likewise wrapped in silk and linen textiles, the apostle's remains (multiple fragments of soft tissue rather than bone) were found inside the portable altar of Countess Gertrude of Braunschweig in 1985, when the trap door on the reliquary's underside was opened for the first time since the late nineteenth century. Its relic content was put back inside the altar together with the other relic pouches. They were removed once again in preparation for the exhibition during the fall of 2009: http://rublev-museum.livejournal.com/109629.html\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art, gift of the John Huntington Art and Polytechnic Trust", "title": "The Portable Altar of Countess Gertrude", "publishedDate": "2011-05-11T11:11:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "1wHIsQVncHw", "description": "NEW ACOUNT!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/BrendaHikaruAMV\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/BrendaHikaruAMV\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/BrendaHikaruAMV\n\nCRACK BOY 2\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJnvYyFiqvk\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJnvYyFiqvk\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJnvYyFiqvk\n\nYeah!!!!

The main objectives of this study are the determination of the scour hole dimensions, with its maximum scour depth, as a function of time and at the equilibrium stage, the scour hole shapes and the investigation of the influence of sills on the distribution of the three velocity components through the scour hole at the same stage. Four experimental configurations were tested, the main difference between them being the distance between sills. Based on experimental data, the classical dimensional analysis of the variables that influence the development of the scour hole has been carried out in order to obtain two empirical formulas predicting the maximum scour depth and the length of the scour hole at the equilibrium stage. Moreover, it was observed that the distance between sills influences the scour hole dimension and shape. The three velocity components of the flow, measured with an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV), show that in the scour hole, at the equilibrium stage, the three-components of the flow turbulence intensities are very high. Near-bed flow vortexes in addition to secondary currents are also observed.\n\nThe movies show typical scour, the sand movement and the vortex formation using rhodamine.\n\nBy Ben Meftah M. and Mossa M., 2004, \"Experimental study of the scour hole downstream of bed sills\", IAHR River Flow 2004, Naples, June 23-25.\n\nhttp://www.iahrmedialibrary.net/", "title": "Scour (2)", "publishedDate": "2013-12-06T11:53:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "1wKlvk_74v8", "description": "This is a time lapse video of one of our happy cabinet refacing customers.

I think the food is about S$200 per guest. But mainly, it's because everything was a la carte, where they had the venue, which is like clean -- it's a blank canvas. We had to bring in our own decoration. Even the furniture, like the table and the chairs, and of course, the caterers. So when you do all things a la carte, you can expect the cost to be more expensive than say, a wedding package from a hotel.\n\n\"It really depends on what you want for the wedding. To be honest, nothing comes free, a lot of things are expensive especially in Singapore when you are talking about the service industry; the food and beverage and the venue in Singapore, and the rental rates are quite high.\"\n\nMs Tioanda said a less expensive wedding is possible, with the cheapest wedding she planned costing a total of S$40,000.\n\nHer tips for couples on a budget include keeping the guest list small and asking friends and family to help out.\n\nCouples whom Channel NewsAsia spoke with and who took about one to two years to plan their wedding, said their budget was between S$10,000 and S$50,000.\n\n\"If I'm going to do it in a hotel, I have to limit my guests because it's going to cost a lot. So I do it in a temple, buffet style, so I can invite more guests to come,\" said a couple whom Channel NewsAsia interviewed.\n\nA low-budget option is to hold a ceremony at the Registry of Marriages.

Note that when multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality sign must be switched. For example, to solve --3x is less than 12, divide both sides by --3, to get x is greater than -4.

The Giant Fuyu Persimmon is seedless and matures into an orange or red tomato shaped fruit that is very sweet to the taste with a distinctive aroma of a fruity perfume.\n  The Fuyu Persimmon can be eaten even in the firm developmental stage, but the best flavor comes when the fruit is slightly soft, but some people prefer to allow the fruit to become very soft at the red color skin stage, when the inside pulp has a thick jelly-like consistency. Fuyu persimmons are very sweet to taste, balanced by a slightly acid flavor and most commonly are eaten by scooping out the pulp with a spoon. In the firm stage persimmons are often peeled and sliced into pieces with a knife. The Fuyu can be dried like other fruits for eating during the winter or spring when fresh persimmons are not available. Persimmon puddings are very delicous when eaten after being freshly baked from the oven, and persimmon cookies have a distinctive aroma and taste like nothing else.\n  The Ty Ty Persimmon trees are grafted onto a black rootstock that is completely resistant to nematodes in the soil.

This conservation law mathematically follows from continuous directional symmetry of space (no direction in space is any different from any other direction).\n\nTHE CAT FALLING PROBLEM\n\nThe falling cat problem consists of explaining the underlying physics behind the common observation of the cat righting reflex: how a free-falling cat can turn itself right-side-up as it falls, no matter which way up it was initially, without violating the law of conservation of angular momentum.\nAlthough somewhat amusing, and trivial to pose, the solution of the problem is not as straightforward as its statement would suggest. The apparent contradiction with the law of conservation of angular momentum is resolved because the cat is not a rigid body, but instead is permitted to change its shape during the fall. The behavior of the cat is thus typical of the mechanics of deformable bodies.\nThe solution of the problem, originally due to (Kane & Scher 1969), models the cat as a pair of cylinders (the front and back halves of the cat) capable of changing their relative orientations. Montgomery (1993) later described the Kane--Scher model in terms of a connection in the configuration space that encapsulates the relative motions of the two parts of the cat permitted by the physics. Framed in this way, the dynamics of the falling cat problem is a prototypical example of a nonholonomic system (Batterman 2003), the study of which is among the central preoccupations of control theory. A solution of the falling cat problem is a curve in the configuration space that is horizontal with respect to the connection (that is, it is admissible by the physics) with prescribed initial and final configurations. Finding an optimal solution is an example of optimal motion planning (Arbyan & Tsai 1998; Xin-sheng & Li-qun 2007).\nIn the language of physics, Mongomery's connection is a certain Yang-Mills field on the configuration space, and is a special case of a more general approach to the dynamics of rigid bodies as represented by gauge fields (Montgomery 1993; Batterman 2003).\n\n\nMORE ON THE CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM \n\nIf a planet is found to rotate slower than expected, then astronomers suspect that the planet is accompanied by a satellite, because the total angular momentum is shared between the planet and its satellite in order to be conserved.\nThe conservation of angular momentum is used extensively in analyzing what is called central force motion. If the net force on some body is directed always toward some fixed point, the center, then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, and so the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. Constant angular momentum is extremely useful when dealing with the orbits of planets and satellites, and also when analyzing the Bohr model of the atom.\nThe conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is constant in the absence of external torques, the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater has to increase.\nThe same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes) when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars (indeed, decreasing the size of object 104 times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor 108).\nThe conservation of angular momentum in Earth--Moon system results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon (due to tidal torque the Moon exerts on the Earth). This in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth (at about 42 nsec/day), and in gradual increase of the radius of Moon's orbit (at ~4.5 cm/year rate).

These Mangala Smaraweers affiliated websites early last Saturday morning carried an audio clip which was said to be a recording of the presidents speech made in Jaffna that week.\n\n The accompanying narrative claimed that the president was jeered when he spoke in faulty Tamil, by a Tamil crowd present at a meeting in Jaffna. (below) . The story further claimed that the president immediately switched to Sinhala and angrily berated the crowd saying if they cannot listen they should leave. The clip further claimed that president Rajapaksa had used the derogatory epithet demala on one of the Tamils assembled, asking all of them to listen without attempting to be too smart, and had also insisted that he would go on speaking in Tamil.\n\nHowever the video which can be accessed at http://video.lankadeepa.lk/videos/245/prasident-vavuniya makes it abundantly clear, the president in fact had barely begun his speech \u2014- in Vavuniya not in Jaffna \u2014- and said ayubowan wannnkam asalam alekun, when he was interrupted by some Sinhalese in the audience.\n\nThere were shouts of \"api Sinhala\" (we are Sinhalese) in Sinhala, with the crowd obviously urging the president to speak in Sinhala as the people assembled were Sinhalese. However the president is seen to say rather angrily that \n\n0:27 \"we sinhala, me Sinhala; therefore listen to Tamil (language) too without being too smart. If not, leave the venue (he refered to sinhalese crowd).  The president further said angrily in Tamil:\n\n00:59 \"The time is gone when we were labled as; \"I am Sinhlalese\" I am Muslim\" and \"I am Tamil\", \"Now we are one nation, one country and we all are children of one mother. Thats how we should think to rebuild the country.\"\n1:31 The more they shout the more he would speak in Tamil implying that there are Tamil people as well in Vavuniya.\n\nThe diabolical thing about the Lanka News web report and the Lanka Truth reports were that these reports took this video and spliced its soundtrack with previous audio clips in which the president speaks in Tamil. This was again spliced with background noise sounding much like jeers and then with the Vavuniya video soundtrack in which the president says in Sinhala listen dont try to be too smart.\n\nThe bottom line is that the Vavuniya video was taken and spliced together with other material to make out that the president angrily scolded Tamil people in Jaffna, and called one of them demalaa to fuel rasicm.\n\nSource and read more at: http://www.lakbimanews.lk/special/spe10.htm\n\n\"Lanka Truth\" False Quote: http://tinyurl.com/ycs3uwt\n\"President Mahinda Rajapakse has used foul language to reproach Tamil people at the UPFA rally held in Jaffna yesterday (1st). Despite addressing the rally in Tamil using two teleprompters he had wrongly pronounced the copy written in Sinhalese. The participants had booed him for the wrong Tamil words he had used and the President who had been enraged had said, Yes, we are Sinhalese. You listern to me, Tamilian. Dont try to be too wise. If you cant listen get out from here. \nThe recording1 : http://www.lankatruth.com/sin/media/mp3/President_jafna_1.mp3 \nRecording 2: http://www.lankatruth.com/sin/media/mp3/President_jafna_2.mp3 \"\n\nLanka News Web's mis quote:  The President during his speech at the Jaffna rally on the 1st had shouted at the Tamil people saying, Yes, we are Sinhala. The country is also Sinhala. Therefore, you Demala (Tamils) listen to me. If you cannot listen without trying to be too smart, then leave. The President had made this statement while making his speech in Tamil with the help of the tele-prompter during the UPFA rally at the Duraiappa Stadium. The people who had not understood his speech had started to shout in anger while the President had shouted back in this manner.  When the Tamil people unable to comprehend what the President was trying to say in his speech had started to shout, and an angry President had said, I will not stop. Since you shouted, I will speak more in Tamil. One of Minister Douglas Devanandas officials had then taken the microphone from the President and had started to calm the crowd. Devananda had also been present at the time the President had lost his cool in this manner. Before attending the rally, the President had visited the Naga Vihara and laid the foundations stone to a rest house for the sangha and visited the Nallur kovil.\"\n\nLink: http://www.lankanewsweb.com/news/EN_2010_04_03_003.html\n\nBRITISH TAMIL FORUM, SURENDREN: http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/apr/11/worldwide-boycott-sri-lanka\n\nGroundviews also passed the batton:  \n1. http://www.groundviews.org/2010/04/04/confusing-reportage-over-comments-by-the-president-propaganda-or-fact/\n2.

I judge each one righteously because I know the intentions of every heart and all thoughts, nothing can be hidden from Me. I know it all. Those deeds some try to hide and do in darkness I will bring it to the light, I expose it because I see and I hear everything. There is no favoritism with Me.\n\nI discipline and reprove every child of Mine that I accept, out of love and because I care. Many despise My discipline and reproof, others accept it although it is not pleasant because they know there is no favoritism with Me and I do it all for good and in love, to change them more and more into My likeness so that they can be pleasing to Me in all their ways, doing My will and not their own. They learn obedience and righteousness out of what they suffer. \n\nIt is not My will that anyone perish but that all repent to have eternal life, but many love darkness more than light because their deeds are evil. I warn, I call many but few listen, or answer to My call. There will be no mercy for those who do not repent because there is no favoritism with Me. Now is mercy time, to accept My grace and forgiveness. That is why I am always warning, I give chances for many to repent before it might be too late. I find no pleasure in the death of a sinner but rather that he would repent and have eternal life. I am holy and I change not. You must be holy because without holiness no one will see Me nor enter into Heaven. I must be pleased with you because I am the only One who will allow you entrance into Heaven or refuse you or cast you into hell. Do not be deceived and do not let the enemy lie to you, there is no favoritism with Me. \n\nMy children, I reward those who diligently seeks Me. I speak and I reveal Myself to them at My time and how I wishes. I want to speak to every child of Mine but not all are willing to wait on Me, to listen to hear from Me for themselves. Many are always in a hurry, not patient, determined enough and walk away disappointed. You must seek Me until you hear from Me. Do not give up or lose hope.

Its populations have been estimated at 1,706--1,909 in India, 440 in Bangladesh, 163--253 in Nepal and 67--81 in Bhutan. Since 2010, it has been classified as endangered by the IUCN. The total population is estimated at fewer than 2,500 individuals with a decreasing trend, and none of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within the Bengal tiger's range is large enough to support an effective population size of 250 adult individuals.\n\nBengal is traditionally fixed as the typical locality for the binomial Panthera tigris, to which the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the Bengal tiger in 1929 under the trinomial Panthera tigris tigris.\n\nIt is the national animal of both India and Bangladesh.\n\nKaziranga National Park is a national park in the Golaghat and Nagaon districts of the state of Assam, India. A World Heritage Site, the park hosts two-thirds of the world's Great One-horned Rhinoceroses. Kaziranga boasts the highest density of tigers among protected areas in the world and was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006. The park is home to large breeding populations of elephants, wild water buffalo, and swamp deer. Kaziranga is recognized as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International for conservation of avifaunal species. Compared to other protected areas in India, Kaziranga has achieved notable success in wildlife conservation. Located on the edge of the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot, the park combines high species diversity and visibility.\n\nKaziranga is a vast expanse of tall elephant grass, marshland, and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests, crisscrossed by four major rivers, including the Brahmaputra, and the park includes numerous small bodies of water. Kaziranga has been the theme of several books, songs, and documentaries. The park celebrated its centennial in 2005 after its establishment in 1905 as a reserve forest.\n\nSource:- Wikipedia\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Re-discovered at various monasteries. \nSimilar to Lambs Quarters in habit, only smaller at 1 1/2 feet.  Triangular, toothed leaves are thinner than spinach, very nutritious and high in vitamins.  Tender shoots are used raw or cooked.  At each leaf axial there is an abundance of small sweet, strawberry-like fruits which some say resemble mulberries.  Nice fresh, cooked or in jellies.  Like other Chenopodiaceae, it may re-seed vigorously and/or become invasive.\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/ZaneyMay\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/zaneymay", "title": "Strawberry Spinach, Beetberry Greens, Specialty", "publishedDate": "2014-06-27T20:16:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "1xBrSzaV34w", "description": "", "title": "Down at the Station - Nursery Rhyme", "publishedDate": "2013-01-08T16:40:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "1xBtNEOlQOU", "description": "FOTA VII Cork 2014, Terce. 4th Sunday after Pentecost, July 6th 2014.

I wound the coils around some nails I had laying around with a drill and some 0.10mm magnet wire.  The rotating part has permanent neodymium magnets.  It is being driven by an arduino and a uln2003 transistor array.  As you can see it works, but it gradually worked less and less well.  (I was afraid that would happen and so I took a video of it right away while it was working well.)  I think I know why and I'm troubleshooting it.  Eventually it will be driven by a little digispark arduino compatable microcontroller that will fit in the empty space.  I'm well aware that this is not an optimal design- I wasn't trying to make a better stepper motor.  I just want to make something kinda cool looking and that illustrates the idea of how stepper motors work.  If I get it working well I may add parts to make it do something arty- but that is a big secret right now.  By the way, working with 0.10mm wire is about as easy as working with spider webs- the fact that I was able to solder all the wires to the board and have it work at all without frying anything was a miracle.  I'm a terrible solderer.

It was serialized in the semi-monthly Japanese magazine Hana to Yume, published by Hakusensha, from 1998 to 2006. The series was also adapted into a 26-episode anime series, directed by Akitaro Daichi. The series tells the story of Tohru Honda, an orphan girl who, after meeting Yuki, Kyo, and Shigure Sohma, learns that twelve members of the Sohma family are possessed by the animals of the Chinese zodiac (\u5341\u4e8c\u652f J\u016bnishi?) and are cursed to turn into their animal forms when they are weak, stressed, or when they are embraced by anyone of the opposite sex that is not possessed by a zodiacal spirit. In the anime it is possible to transform through torso contact.\n\nThe word \"Fruits\" in the title is always plural; the spelling originates from the transcription of the English word \"fruit\" into Japanese, where because there is no \"tu\" sound, \"tsu\" is used instead. The title comes from the name of a popular game played in Japanese elementary schools, which is alluded to in the series.\n\nWhen high school student Tohru Honda's mother dies in a car crash on her way to work, she decides to live with her grandfather. Renovations on the house cause her to move out of her grandfather's house temporarily, and since she has nowhere else to go, Tohru begins living in a tent and supporting herself. That is, until she finds a home in the least likely of places, inhabited by her popular classmate Yuki Sohma and his cousins Shigure and Kyo. The Sohmas however, live with a curse. Twelve (not including Kyo, who is the cat) members of the family are possessed by spirits of the Chinese zodiac and turn into their zodiac animal when they are weak, under stress, or when hugged by someone of the opposite gender.\n\nWhen Tohru discovers the Sohmas' secret, she promises not to tell and is allowed to keep living with them. Although the Sohmas' curse is deeper and darker than Tohru realized, her presence and her acceptance of them soon becomes a large, positive influence on those possessed by the zodiac. She sets out to break the curse, and on the way, meets and discovers each of the Sohma's vengeful zodiac spirits. Each has a different personality, just like the animals in the Chinese zodiac. Tohru's existence changes the Sohma clan's lives forever.\n\nDirected by Akitaro Daichi, the twenty-six episode Fruits Basket anime series was animated and produced by Studio DEEN. It premiered on TV Tokyo on July 5, 2001, with the final episode airing on December 27, 2001. The series aired in France on France 4, in Spain on Buzz Channel, and in Vietnam on HTV3. FUNimation aired the series, in dubbed English, on their anime television channel as well as on Colours TV.\n\nThe series was released in Japan in nine individual DVD volumes by King Records, with each volume containing three episodes except for the first volume, which contained two. The first volume was released on September 29, 2001, with subsequent volumes released on a monthly basis until the final volume was released on May 22, 2002. A series box set was released on April 25, 2007, containing all twenty-six episodes, as well a message card from Natsuki Takaya, a 60-page deluxe booklet, and a bonus Fruits Basket CD soundtrack.\n\nThe series is licensed for Region 1 DVD release by FUNimation Entertainment, which released it in the form of four individual volumes containing 6-7 episodes and a complete series box set. On November 20, 2007, FUNimation re-released the series as part of their lower priced Viridian line, with the new release containing the complete series in a thin-packed box set. In the United Kingdom, FUNimation originally distributed the series through MVM Entertainment, but then changed distributors in November 2006 to Revelation Films. Revelation re-released the four individual volumes under their label. They also released the series box set on January 22, 2007. In Region 4, the series was released as a complete series box set by Madman Entertainment on October 15, 2003.\n\nThe 136 chapters of Fruits Basket were originally serialized in Japan by Hakusensha in Hana to Yume from July 1998 to November 2006. These were collected in 23 tank\u014dbon volumes, with the final volume published in Japan on March 19, 2007.", "title": "Fruits Basket OST Soundtrack mysterious family", "publishedDate": "2014-08-17T15:03:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "1xO8UUdQCy8", "description": "http://checksave.com/x/0/3621/58240/getavonfree/ Get your Avon Anti-Aging Set free!", "title": "Anti-aging Eye Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor", "publishedDate": "2012-02-04T18:19:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "1xOW4iR1NKI", "description": "You can hear the sweet whistling tune of the Yellow Warbler across most of North America during breeding season.

The moisture that humidifiers add to dry air helps alleviate common nuisances brought on by winter heating, such as static electricity, peeling wallpaper, and cracks in paint and furniture. Many physicians recommend the use of a humidifier to help relieve congestion from the common cold and flu as an alternative to over-the-counter cough and cold medicine.\n\nThe Drop Shape Cool Mist Humidifier was a finalist in the 2011 International Housewares Design Awards. Thanks to its fun, contemporary design and whisper-quiet operation, it is discreet enough to be left out when company visits. \n\nOperating the Crane Drop Shape Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier requires only a few easy steps. Simply remove the water tank from the unit, unscrew the tank cap, and fill the water tank under a water faucet. Securely replace the tank cap, making sure the rubber cap seal is in place, and place the water tank back onto the unit. Place the humidifier on an elevated surface and set it to a medium output setting for comfortable room humidification.\n\nImportant Tips\nIf you have a lot of minerals in your tap water, it is recommended to use distilled water, filtered water, or a Crane demineralization filter (HS-3161). Place humidifier on an elevated surface and not on carpet, towel, or sensitive wood furniture.\n\nCleaning and Storage\nFrequently cleaning your humidifier is very important. Crane recommends emptying the water in the basin daily, making sure you pour away from the fan air-outlet. Disinfect the water basin and tank weekly by using a white vinegar and fresh water solution, let sit for 30 minutes, then rinse. For convenience, the Crane Descaler solution HS-1933 is also available. It is important to disinfect and dry completely before storage.\n\nWhat's in the Box:\nCrane White and Blue Drop Shape Cool Mist Humidifier and operation manual/warranty.\n\ncrane drop shape cool mist humidifier\ncrane cool mist humidifier\ncrane drop humidifier\ncrane ultrasonic cool mist humidifier\nbest cool mist humidifier\ncool mist humidifier reviews\nultrasonic cool mist humidifier\ncrane drop shape humidifier\ncrane drop ultrasonic cool mist humidifier\nbuy humidifier\ncrane cool mist drop shape humidifier\nwhere to buy humidifier\ncrane drop cool mist humidifier\ncrane cool mist\ncrane drop shape cool mist humidifier review\nultrasonic cool mist humidifier crane\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xSgSu487sQ\ncrane drop shape cool mist humidifier manual\ncrane cool mist drop shape humidifier - blue\ncrane mist humidifier\ncrane ultrasonic cool mist humidifier manual\ncrane pink drop shape ultrasonic cool mist humidifier\nbuy cool mist humidifier\ncrane drop ultrasonic cool mist humidifier - white\nwhere to buy crane humidifier\ncrane cool mist humidifier review\ncrane ultrasonic cool mist humidifier white drop\ncrane cool mist drop shape humidifier white\ncrane drop shape ultrasonic cool mist humidifier with 2.3 gallon\ncrane drop shape 2.3 gallon cool mist humidifier\ncrane cool mist humidifier drop shape\ncrane drop ultrasonic cool mist humidifier reviews\ncrane 2.3 gallon cool mist humidifier\ncrane ultrasonic cool mist humidifier review\ncrane cool mist humidifiers\ncrane warm and cool mist humidifier\nwhere can i buy a cool mist humidifier\ncrane ultrasonic warm and cool mist humidifier\ncrane cool mist drop shape humidifier review\n\nhttp://amzn.to/1pLXHvQ\n\nCrane Drop Shape Cool Mist Humidifier Green Orange Pink White Blue and White Review", "title": "Crane Drop Shape Cool Mist Humidifier Green Orange Pink White Blue and White Review", "publishedDate": "2014-06-29T10:30:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "1xTC1BRVJkk", "description": "from new album =)", "title": "Hiroyuki Oda - Ionosphere (Sample)", "publishedDate": "2010-08-21T11:48:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "1xTWhbvRpt0", "description": "http://www.BenGlassLaw.com\nhttp://www.JustAskBenGlass.com\n\nVirginia medical malpractice attorney Ben Glass explains subrogation and how it can affect your case.

S-300 SAM replacement [SKY DEFENDER]\n\n\nSubscribe here for more world news:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/WYNKnews?feature=mhee\n\nRussia has for the first time demonstrated the short-to-mid-range air defense platform 'Vityaz,' which will replace older variants of the S-300 system due to be scrapped soon. The army will begin testing the new hardware later this year.\n\nThe new  surface-to-air missile system is made by Russian weapons manufacturer Almaz-Antey. The company demonstrated the system at the Obukhov State Plant in St. Petersburg, home to its branch that manufactures the Vityaz launchers. \n\n The system boasts advanced all-aspect phased array radar, a new mobile command post and a launcher carrying 12 vertical-launch missiles, which will use a variant of the 9M96 active radar homing missile. Similar missiles are used by the S-400, the newer generation of the S-300, which is currently being deployed in Russia.\n\nVityaz launchers can also fire a short-range missile that was not officially identified, but is likely a variant of the 9M100.\n\n\"I believe the system will be able to engage target within ranges from 30km to 120km,\" Said Aminov, military analyst and editor of the World of Air Defense website told RT. \"It's a system of object air defense with some element of tactical antimissile defense.\"\n\nAlmaz-Antey aims to hand over the system to the Russian Defense Ministry for testing before the year's end, company head Vladislav Menshikov told Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was inspecting the plant.\n\nThe company partially based the design of the Vityaz on its work with the South Korean KM-SAM Chun Koong system. Almaz-Antey designed three radar units for the KM-SAM, and is rumored to have also helped design the system's missiles.\n\nThe Russian military officially backed the Vityaz project -- which has better capabilities than the Korean air defense system -- after studying its performance, Almaz-Antey said in 2010. The new Russian system has been in the works since 2007, and is expected to be completed in record time.\n\nThe ministry earlier said it plans to buy at least 30 Vityaz systems before 2020, if it passes testing, and deployment of the platforms could start as early as next year. \n\n Vityaz was designed as a replacement for the S-300PS, an older variant of the S-300 air defense system developed in the early 1980s. The Russian army is expected to decommission about 50 of the S-300PS by 2015 due to old age.\n\nThe name of the system comes from an archaic Slavic word for a noble warrior. It is shared by the famous aerobatic team known as the Russkie Vityazi ('Russian Knights').\n\nRussia plans to deploy the Vityaz system alongside other advanced air defense weapons, including the service-ready S-400 and Pantsir-S1, and the future long-range S-500 and short-range Morfei. Moscow aims to create a multi-layered grid to cover Russia's airspace, defending against threats ranging from drones, to conventional manned aircraft, to cruise and ballistic missiles.", "title": "Russia unveils NEW surface-to-air MISSILE system VITYAZ!

Photograph: Taamallah/Laurentvu/SIPA/REX/SIPA/REXAnyone who tuned in to the World Cup's opening ceremony hoping to learn precisely what a World Cup opening ceremony is for would have come away slightly disappointed. Unlike, say, Olympic opening ceremonies they are not supposed to be any kind of reflection on the host country.Indeed, such parochialism would be downright frowned upon by today's World Cup mentality, considering that both the official anthem and slogan this time round is the typically Fifa-ishly nonsensical, and distinctly Benetton-esque, \"We Are One\".As many have pointed out, the lead singers of the anthem this year, Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez, seem to have been chosen in the spirit of this kind of international unity, seeing as neither are actually Brazilian: Pitbull was born in the US to Cuban parents and Lopez, albeit originally From The Block, is also American with Puerto Rican parents. But we'll get back to that.So perhaps it's best to think of the opening ceremony as the fluffer for the World Cup, and certainly some was needed in S\u00e3o Paulo this week which has been looking, as has been widely reported, albeit in possibly different terms, decidedly unfluffed.abc breaking news, bbc, bbc football, bbc iplayer, bbc news, bbc news america, bbc persian, bbc sport, bbc weather, bbc world news, breaking celebrity news, breaking election news, breaking late news, breaking local news, breaking music news, breaking news, breaking news alerts, breaking news canada, breaking news headlines, breaking news in atlanta, breaking news in nigeria, breaking news india, breaking news pensacola florida, breaking news plane crash, breaking news story, breaking sports news, business expensive news home media world, christian world news, cnn, cnn breaking news, cnn money, cnn news, cnn news breaking news, cnn news world, detroit breaking news, global news, headline, headline news, health care technology news, hot latest global news, internet technology news, las vegas breaking news, latest breaking news, latest celebrity news, latest information technology news, latest music news, latest news, latest news headlines, latest news update, latest sports news, live breaking news, local breaking news, local news today, msn breaking news, nbc breaking news, nbc world news, news of the world, news report us world, news today news, news updated daily, solar technology news, sports news today, technology news, the latest news, today news, us news and world, us news and world report, us news and world report magazine, us news and world report web site, us news world report, world news, world news daily, world news headlines", "title": "Pitbull and Jennifer lopez performance at WORLD CUP ceremony    LATEST", "publishedDate": "2014-06-15T09:17:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "1xbxNhXvjmg", "description": "When it  comes to safety look no further than Lifeline.

They started playing mainly covers of classic as well as obscure garage standards. They also had some original compositions, as a first evidence of their creativity.\nIn the summer of 1996 they released their first 7\" EP through Golbin Records (which later became Action Records). The tracks on this EP lean towards the groovy side of the 60's garage rhythms. More live appearances, both inside and outside Athens, followed the release of the EP, making the name of the band known to a wider audience in the Greek scene. Meanwhile the band got more confidence to fill it's set with original compositions, leaving aside the covers. Their sound turned to more moody melodies and shake rhythms, clearly showing the band's great talent. \nArround the end of 1996 two new members came: Christos Pierros on bass and Sotiris on drums. This new line-up gave more strength to the band's repertoire and helped them make more dynamic shows. In the spring of 1997 the Cardinals released their debut LP through Action Records, clearly bringing forth the moody melodies of the group.", "title": "The Cardinals - You Never Told Me Goodby", "publishedDate": "2013-07-29T13:35:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "1xe4eVkkxfs", "description": "Michael Horton describes the sacramental word.", "title": "The Sacramental Word", "publishedDate": "2011-02-25T19:16:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "1xe916cF3pc", "description": "1x11", "title": "Nina & Cameron (Windfall)", "publishedDate": "2013-04-22T21:49:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "1xevKKd2bZs", "description": "Bach -  Sinfonia  no.9,  F minor BWV 795\nusing  vocaloid  Megpoid", "title": "Bach BWV 795 - Sinfonia  no.9, F minor    ver.

It can also cause the head to uncontrollably tilt forward or backward. Another name for this condition is \"spasmodic torticollis\".\n\nMedical specialists do not know what causes Cervical dystonia.  They believe that there is no known cure for Cervical dystonia.  Botulinum toxin used for cosmetic wrinkle relaxing is injected into the neck muscles to paralyze them. Since this toxin's effect wears off over time, it is repeated every three or four months.\n\nIs it absolutely NOT possible that the spasms and tilting of the head are an attempt by the nervous system to accommodate for a misalignment of the jaws? Does it seem farfetched?  Jaw alignment DOES affect the head and neck alignment. When the upper cervical vertebrae are misaligned the nervous system tightens the neck muscles as a protective reflect.\n\nMike has been suffering from Cervical Dystonia for over a decade. He was diagnosed by physicians at Mayo clinic in Minnesota who gave Botulinum toxin injection in his neck muscles.  He had limited relief from it.  Later it was repeated at Mayo clinic in Arizona.  This time the relief was even less. Mike had accepted that nothing can be done.\n\nMike came to us for relief of jaw pain and headache.  At the end of the visit to diagnose the optimal Neuromuscular jaw position that also optimizes neck and head posture a bite record is taken. This is called a 'myobite'.  His cervical dystonia was predictably aggravated when he turned his head to the left.  However when the myobite was placed in his mouth and he turned his head to the left, the dystonia was completely absent.  But once the myobite was removed and he put his natural teeth together, the spasms returned.  It is exciting to be able turn the spasms off when the jaw, neck and head posture is optimized through advanced Neuromuscular dental protocols.  Mike is starting orthotic therapy to help his jaw pain and headache. This orthotic is made to the myobite relation to maintain his jaw and neck in this alignment 24/7 as a diagnostic step for 90 days.  It will be amazing if his Cervical Dystonia is also relieved. I am very confident that it will.  The power of Advanced LVI Neuromuscular dentistry protocols continues to amaze us.", "title": "Cervical dystonia.wmv", "publishedDate": "2011-12-20T11:35:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "1xuEowtB7qg", "description": "In this short video, the presenter demonstrates how many bacteria are growing on your hands and how you can incubate them on agar.

The result \u2014 55 percent to 45 percent \u2014 was more decisive than pollsters had foreseen and prompted Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who led the unsuccessful Yes campaign, to resign. But it meant almost half of Scotland's more than 5 million people woke up in a country, the United Kingdom, that they wished to leave.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, who has kept out of the political debate, said Friday that \"all of us throughout the United Kingdom will respect\" the result. In a statement from her Scottish home at Balmoral castle, the monarch said \"despite the range of views that have been expressed, we have in common an enduring love of Scotland, which is one of the things that helps to unite us all.\"\n\nStill, Yes supporters have first to get over their bitter disappointment.\n\"This time, I thought my vote would count for something,\" said truck driver Calum Noble, 25, his voice cracking with emotion as a drizzly mist enveloped the Scottish city of Glasgow.\n\n\"I wanted a better country, but it's all been for nothing. I don't believe we will get any of the things the London politicians promised.\" Salmond's impassioned plea to launch a new nation fell short, with Scots choosing instead the security of remaining in union with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Yet the independence drive tapped a wellspring of youth and energy that campaigners vowed would endure.\n\n Margot MacDonald, former deputy leader of the Scottish National Party, wrote to the boss of MI5, Andrew Parker (above) asking for an assurance that MI5 spies would not interfere in the referendum on independence for Scotland.\n\nThis is while the British state broadcaster BBC has been accused of biased coverage against the independence of Scotland. Salmond has slammed the network for using a \u201cdirty tricks campaign\u201d to disrupt the outcome of this week\u2019s referendum on Scottish independence. scotland scottish independence \"scotland independence\" \"vote no\" \"vote yes\" vote uk british \"united kingdom\" \"great britain\" ballot 2014 2015 future union england london evidence camera footage media news entertainment count counting \"made in uk\" \"made in scotland\" whiskey \"scotch whiskey\" campaign government election elite games trendy trending viral europe \"european union\" gbp pound gold oil edinburgh glasgow \"elite nwo agenda\" exposed truth contract contractor alex jones infowars rant gerald celente max keiser david icke anonymous spain italy quebec texas states u.s. usa illuminati bilderberg royal bloodlines citizenship daboo7 glenn beck coast to coast am lindsey williams louis farrakhan\nqueen of england british empire rule britania 10 kingdoms eugenics \nThe Westminster has repeatedly warned against Scotland\u2019s independence, saying it will jeopardize the UK\u2019s stability and damage its international standing. Scottish authorities, on the other hand, argue that independence from the UK would free Scotland from London\u2019s austerity policies and unnecessary military spending. The independence referendum could result in Scotland\u2019s breakaway from the United Kingdom after more than 300 years of political union.\nIn Glasgow, \"Police are investigating ten cases of electoral fraud.\"\n\nThe head of Russia\u2019s election observation body has sensationally accused the British government in Westminster of rigging the Scottish Independence vote, asserting that there were more \u2018yes\u2019 votes than \u2018no\u2019 votes despite the no campaign claiming victory. \u201cWe can see that, with the exception of Glasgow, those supporting independence failed to register a majority. I think that Westminster propaganda played a great part in that. I suppose it is down to information put out in recent weeks, from the party leaders, [that had impact on the vote], thanks to that the Scots arrived at the result they have,\u201d Morozov said. In the first example, bundles of referendum papers are seen on top of a table designated for \u2018No\u2019 votes and yet when zoomed in, the top paper on two of the bundles clearly shows an X marked in the box for \u2018Yes\u2019. \u201cLast night police officers were present at the count to remove the ballot papers and keep them as evidence,\u201d reports the Daily Mail. \u201cThe papers were from 10 different boxes across Glasgow, and not concentrated in one area.\u201d", "title": "ALEX SALMOND Scottish Nationalist Leader RESIGNS after After LOSING SCOTLAND INDEPENDENCE Vote", "publishedDate": "2014-09-20T12:00:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "1y181UAT6Qk", "description": "*UPDATE* July 31 2012: NEW COSTUME HAS BEEN MADE!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJiddjf4C7A CHECK IT OUT! :D\n*UPDATE* April-5-2012: So this costume has been officially retired...

Zoo hours vary by season, and the zoo is closed on Mondays.\n\nNehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad was established in vide G.O.Ms. No.247, dated 26 October 1959. It was opened to the public on 6 October 1963. The Nehru Zoological Park is run by forest department, Government of Telangana, and is named after the first prime minister of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nThe zoo occupies 380 acres (150 ha) and is adjacent to the 600-acre (240 ha) Mir Alam Tank. Nearly 100 species of birds, animals and reptiles are housed at the zoo, including indigenous animals like the Indian rhino, Asiatic lion, Bengal tiger, panther, gaur, Indian elephant, slender loris, python, as well as deer, antelopes and birds. The 600-acre (240 ha) Mir Alam Tank with its unique multiple arched bund (embankment), attracts hundreds of migratory birds, providing yet another attraction for the zoo.\n\nThe nocturnal house at the zoo artificially reverses night and day for the animals so that nocturnal animals are active while visitors are at the zoo. This exhibit includes fruit bats, slender loris, slow loris, civets, leopard cats, hedgehogs, barn owls, mottled wood owls, fishing owls, and great horned owls. There is also an aquarium, dino park, butterfly park and tortoise house.\n\nSwans are birds of the family Anatidae within the genus Cygnus. The swans' close relatives include the geese and ducks. Swans are grouped with the closely related geese in the subfamily Anserinae where they form the tribe Cygnini. Sometimes, they are considered a distinct subfamily, Cygninae. There are six or seven species of swan in the genus Cygnus; in addition there is another species known as the coscoroba swan, although this species is no longer considered one of the true swans. Swans usually mate for life, though \"divorce\" does sometimes occur, particularly following nesting failure. And if a mate dies, or is killed by a predator, the remaining mate will take up with another; however, if all goes well in the pairing, they indeed will stay together for life. The number of eggs in each clutch ranges from three to eight.\n\nPlease SUBSCRIBE to my channel and visit again.", "title": "A Black Head Swan In Zoo.", "publishedDate": "2014-10-10T07:06:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "1y8qb-wTnRY", "description": "Join Mario Scordato and learn how to make a tasty asparagus bisque.", "title": "Asparagus Bisque", "publishedDate": "2013-08-12T19:55:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "1y8yvseDNHA", "description": "http://www.wind-lock.com/\n\n800-872-5625\n\nWhy throw out a Froth-Pak gun hose assembly when you can re-use it?

A three-dimensional animated model of the eye in accommodation and disaccommodation was produced in collaboration with an experienced medical animator.\n\nCurrent understanding of the anatomy of the zonule and the attachments of the vitreous zonule to the anterior hyaloid membrane is incomplete. Recent studies have demonstrated three components of the vitreous zonule:\n\n(1) anterior vitreous zonule (previously \"hyalocapsular\" zonule), which attaches the ciliary plexus in the valleys of the ciliary processes to the anterior hyaloid membrane in the region medial to the ciliary body and Weiger's ligament;\n\n(2) intermediate vitreous zonule, which attaches the ciliary plexus to the anterior hyaloid peripherally;\n\nand (3) posterior vitreous zonule, which creates a sponge-like ring at the attachment zone that anchors the pars plana zonules.\n\nThe pars plana zonules attach posteriorly to the elastic choroid above the ora serrata. Analysis of the computer-animated model demonstrates the synchronized movements of the accommodative structures in accommodation and disaccommodation.\n\nUtilizing model-based reasoning, it is shown that the posterior zonules attach to and provide traction to the anterior vitreous membrane and Weiger's ligament. This model supports the concept that the ciliary body/zonule/anterior hyaloid complex contributes to the changes in the posterior lens capsule during accommodation, supporting an extralenticular component to accommodation and demonstrating an alternative to the \"vitreous support\" theories.\n\nThere is a reciprocal action of the anterior zonules and the posterior zonules. During ciliary body contraction, the anterior zonules lose tension while the posterior zonules stretch and exert force on the posterior lens capsule playing a role in shaping the posterior lens thickness and curvature.\n\nDuring ciliary body relaxation, the posterior zonules lose tension as the lens flattens and is pulled back by the increasing tension of the anterior zonules.", "title":

She hands it to Monty and he ties it onto a large weight.  Leslie looks impressed as he swings the weight through the air - you would expect this to stretch it would you not?!  After untying it Monty shows Leslie that it has not altered the length of the stocking.  Monty then gets a table fork out of his pocket.  C/U of the fork being scraped along the stocking - no ladders!  The stockings are made from a new \"Crinkle Crimp\" nylon.  Narrator explains how the new manufacturing process makes the nylons very strong.\n\n\n\nAnother test is demonstrated: \"one that will really stretch your imagination.\"  Monty ties a stocking to the front of a car then pulls the car along, using the stocking as a tow rope.  Leslie takes her shoe off and we see her sitting on the bonnet of the car and putting the stocking back on.
