La gripe porcina es una enfermedad respiratoria de cerdos causada por el virus de la gripe. Normalmente el virus no afecta a los seres humanos, pero a veces el virus se transmite a personas que tienen contacto directo con cerdos. La epidemia actual ha sido causada por la transmisi\u00f3n de persona a persona. \n\nStep 2: Entiende c\u00f3mo se propaga\nLa gripe porcina se propaga de persona a persona como un resfriado: El virus puede transmitirse a trav\u00e9s de la tos, los estornudos o cuando una persona ya infectada respira en otra persona, o al tocar una superficie que tiene el virus y despu\u00e9s tocar la nariz, los ojos, o la boca. El contacto directo con cerdos infectados tambi\u00e9n puede transmitir el virus a personas y viceversa. Hasta ahora, no hay otros animales que pueden transmitir el virus a los seres humanos. \n\nTip\nNo se adquiere el virus por comer carne de puerco cocinada o de otros productos de cerdo. \n\nStep 3: L\u00e1vate las manos\nL\u00e1vate las manos con agua caliente y jab\u00f3n con frecuencia, enjabonando por tanto tiempo como toma cantar \"El Cumplea\u00f1os Feliz\" dos veces, o aproximadamente 20 segundos. Usa desinfectador de manos entre lavados, y evita tocar los ojos, la nariz, y la boca. No le des la mano a nadie. \n\nStep 4: Evita a las personas enfermas\nSi alguien demuestra s\u00edntomas de un resfriado o una gripe, mant\u00e9n tu distancia. \n\nStep 5: No supongas inmunidad\nNo supongas que tienes inmunidad a la gripe porcina porque tuviste una vacuna contra la gripe el a\u00f1o pasado. Es posible que no te proteja de esta cepa, aunque pueda protegerte de otras. \n\nTip\nDistinto de otros virus de la gripe, que suelen atacar a los sistemas inmunol\u00f3gico debilitados, la gripe porcina florece en los cuerpos j\u00f3venes, fuertes, y sanos. \n\nStep 6: Reconocer los s\u00edntomas\nConoce a los s\u00edntomas, que incluyen una fiebre m\u00e1s alta de 100 grados Fahrenheit, dolores del cuerpo, una tos, dolor de garganta, y congesti\u00f3n respiratoria. Algunas personas pueden ener diarrea y v\u00f3mito tambi\u00e9n. \n\nStep 7: No te demores en buscar atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica\nSi presentas los s\u00edntomas, no demores la atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica. La gripe porcina puede ser tratada con los medicamentos antivirus oseltamivir y zanamivir, tambi\u00e9n conocidos con las marcas Tamiflu y Relenza, que son los m\u00e1s efectivos cuando los tomas dentro de 48 horas tras la aparici\u00f3n de los s\u00edntomas.\n\nStep 8: Protege a otras personas\nSi te diagnostican con cualquier tipo de la gripe, qu\u00e9date en casa y limita la interacci\u00f3n con tus seres amados por siete d\u00edas tras la aparici\u00f3n de los s\u00edntomas para evitar contagiar a otras personas. \n\nStep 9: Lleva una m\u00e1scara\nSi vives en un \u00e1rea con un brote de la gripe porcina, lleva una m\u00e1scara. La gripe porcina se propaga a trav\u00e9s de gotitas respiratorias, que se transfieren a trav\u00e9s de la tos, un estornudo, o incluso una exhalaci\u00f3n. \n\nTip\nUna m\u00e1scara simple filtra aproximadamente 62 por ciento de peque\u00f1as part\u00edculas; una de grado profesional no deja pasar 98 por ciento.\n\nStep 10: \u00a1No te dejes llevar por el p\u00e1nico!\nNo te dejes llevar por el p\u00e1nico si recientemente has visitado un \u00e1rea con un brote. El periodo de incubaci\u00f3n es tres a cinco d\u00edas, as\u00ed que si no presentas algunos s\u00edntomas de la gripe por una semana despu\u00e9s de tu viaje, probablemente no est\u00e9s infectado. \n\nDid You Know?\nEl Banco Mundial ha calculado que en el peor de los casos, una pandemia de gripe costar\u00e1 a la econom\u00eda del mundo 3 billones de d\u00f3lares.", "title": "C\u00f3mo Prevenir Y Reconocer Los S\u00edntomas De La Gripe Porcina", "publishedDate": "2009-06-16T14:57:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "5HiMMZkKeUc", "description": "This clip shows the restoration done after the removal in and around homes in Libby.  Processed vermiculite from the WR Grace Libby MT Mine contained tremolite, a form of asbestos that was allowed to contaminate local homes and has caused hundreds of cases of asbestos-related disease in this small mountain town. Since November, 1999, the US EPA has cleaned up the major source areas of contamination around town. US EPA is now cleaning up smaller sources found in a variety of places such as around homes and businesses. EPA conducts stringent clearance sampling after cleanup and has begun some targeted sampling to measure the effectiveness of cleanup several months later.  In February 2005, seven executives and managers of W. R. Grace were indicted on ten federal criminal counts of knowingly endangering residents of Libby, and concealing information about the health effects of its mining operations. The defendants are also accused of obstructing the government's cleanup efforts and wire fraud.  For more and current information on the asbestos abatement work in Libby, go to the US EPA website at http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/libby/ .  For more information about asbestos and the proposal to finally ban its use in the US, go to Senator Patty Murrays website http://murray.senate.gov/asbestos/index.cfm .

Boldly stride or nervously creep along a high wire course made up of zip lines, swings, suspension bridges and a controlled parachute jump\n \nBarbuda\n=========\nVisit the less-developed Barbuda for its wild beauty, deserted beaches and heavily wooded interior abounding in wildlife. The main town, known as the village, is Codrington. It sits on the edge of a lagoon. Laid-back and old-fashioned, visitors share the winding streets with donkeys and goats, and fast food outlets and noisy bars don\u2019t exist.\n\nBeaches\n=========\nThere are hundreds of beaches on Antigua but some of the best include Half Moon Bay, stretching for nearly a mile on the south eastern coast and popular with windsurfers and snorkellers. For those seeking peace and quiet, the southwestern point off Johnson\u2019s Point is tranquil and the nearby Turner\u2019s beach has great views out to Montserrat. On the north coast Dickenson\u2019s Bay is safe and popular with families, and nearby you find quieter beaches and can even sneak off to uninhabited inlets such as Prickly Pear Island.\n\nBetty\u2019s Hope\n=========\nThe islands' colonial history is brought home at partially-restored Betty's Hope, Antigua\u2019s pioneer sugar plantation. The surviving structures are two stone sugar mills and a still house which form an open air museum and good picnic spot. It was built by Sir Christopher Codrington who named it after his daughter Betty.\n\nBush Safari\n===========\nGo for a bush safari in Barbuda. Stop for a picnic in the shade and watch for the wildlife amongst the sparkling salt ponds.\n\nCricket\n==========\nCricket is played to the highest international standard as well as by enthusiastic amateurs in villages all over the islands. Antigua produced one of the finest cricketers the game has ever seen, Sir Vivien Richards and the country\u2019s national stadium in St Johns is named after him. The Sir Vivian Richards Stadium was built for the 2007 Cricket World Cup and is found close to the airport. It is possible to visit the stadium.\n\nFig Tree Drive\n============\nAntigua\u2019s most picturesque drive takes you down the scenic route of Fig Tree Drive. The 32km (20miles) of winding roads travel through the lush tropical hills and rainforest and rise to the steep farmlands around Fig Tree Hill before descending to the coast. Fig is the Antiguan name for banana and along the way you\u2019ll see not just bananas but mangoes and coconut groves.\n\nFrigate Bird Sanctuary.\n=================\nSituated in the Codrington Lagoon, the Frigate Bird sanctuary is a forty minute boat ride across the water. It is a spectacular sight even for non-bird watchers. In the mating season from September to April this rare bird displays a huge red breast to attract a female mate and they lay one egg on a nest built precariously on the mangrove.\n\nGreat Bird Island\n===============\nTake an excursion to Great Bird Island from Dickenson Bay. Glass-bottomed boats afford leisurely views of the reef, and a restored pirate ship sails around the island and takes passengers for day or evening trips, with food, drink and entertainment included.\n\nHighland House\n===============\nAt Barbuda's highest point of 38m (125 ft) are the ruins of the estate once run by Sir Christopher Codrington. Highland House, formerly known as Codrington House, dates back to the 18th century. Just 5km (3 miles) from Codrington Village still stands the 17m-high (56 ft) Martello Castle and tower, a fortress with a raised gun platform that was originally built by the British to defend the island. Both spots offer great views.\n\nIndian Town Point\n===================\nThe wild side of Antigua can be seen at Devil\u2019s Bridge, a limestone arch on the shore of Indian Town Point on the eastern side of the island where at high tide the Atlantic waves come crashing through boreholes in the rocks near the bridge. Indian Town Point is thought to have been an Arawak campsite before the Europeans colonized the islands. Guided tours are available.\n\nLocal Markets\n===============\nSalivate and haggle over the riot of colourful fruits, vegetables and spices available at one of the best local markets in the Caribbean, situated in the south end of town at the junction of Valley and All Saints Roads.\n\nSt John's Cathedral\n================\nAlthough it has been rebuilt three times because of hurricane damage, the present day St John\u2019s Cathedral with its dramatic white towers is an imposing landmark built in 1845. It is worth a visit and contains some items from the churches that previously stood on the same spot and the bronze figures of St John the Baptist and St John the Divine are said to be taken from a French ship in 1756.", "title": "St. John's, Antigua cruise (HD)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-01T07:31:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "5HjNt8vz7EA", "description": "", "title": "Atavist Student Two", "publishedDate": "2013-04-27T13:36:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "5HjVpVXI3Bo", "description": "Today I bought 9 items at CVS pharmacy and out of the register came 39 inches of receipt!", "title": "How much bigger are sales receipts going to get?", "publishedDate": "2007-10-09T01:45:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "5HjZ_5ixTHA", "description": "http://bostonlandscapesupply.com/recycling.php - 415 American Legion Hwy, Boston, MA.

We continue to develop a resistance to antibiotics. Over-prescribing doctors are often blamed. The Food and Drug Administration says 80% of the antibiotics sold in the United States are for livestock animals. Farmers often treat pigs, cattle, chickens and other animals with these drugs. Some believe it's affecting your health. Pat Hankins has spent over 40 years around beef cattle.So they have a virtual salad bar here, says Hankins.Hankins is an organic farmer in Marshall County. His animals never receive hormone supplements or antibiotics. A philosophy Hankins formed after working 12 years on a large cattle ranch in Arizona.It didn't seem necessary to me, says Hankins. If the animal is well, why do we keep pumping them full of medicine?Unlike grass fed cows in Arizona, Hankins' job was to feed beef cattle hay and grain twice a day, always including a low dose of drugs.We'd also include granulated antibiotics regardless, if the animals were sick or not, says Hankins.In 2011, 30 million lbs. of antibiotics were sold to farmers. That's 80% of all sales that year. The most common uses on farms: treating sick animals, preventing diseases among healthy ones, and even using antibiotics to encourage growth.We have a public health crisis on our hands for the past 10 years, says Infectious Disease Expert Dr. Cecilia Di Pentima.Dr. Di Pentima studies antibiotic resistance at Vanderbilt Medical Center. She's very concerned about how the overuse of drugs on farms could affect you.By handling #1 food, and #2 by handling the animals, people can become carriers of those resistant strains, says Dr. Di Pentima.Di Pentima says drug resistance is getting worse. An infection that used to be treated with a pill now requires an IV with a broad spectrum antibiotic. The FDA issues an annual report about the numerous drug resistant organisms found on the meat we eat. Di Pentima says doctors and farmers must be more responsible to preserve the lifespan of antibiotics.We're burning them at a very fast pace, and we cannot keep up, says Dr. Di Pentima. That is reality.Delivering that message to farmers falls to University of Tennessee Beef Cattle Specialist Justin Rhinehart.They're very interested in doing this the right way and maintaining a very safe and wholesome product, says Dr. Rhinehart.Dr. Rhinehart helps administer the Beef Quality Assurance Program. Extension officers work with farmers across the state. They say their goal is to make sure the meat you buy is safe.Let the cattle producer know how and when to use antibiotics, how to have that relationship with their veterinarian to determine when is the appropriate time to use them, says Dr. Rhinehart.Dr. Rhinehart says Tennessee farmers are learning. 17,000 have been trained. He also defends the use of low dosage drugs given to healthy animals.We do use some therapeutic dosing with cattle to maintain health, says Dr. Rhinehart.Organic farmer Pat Hankins chooses a different drug-free approach, even if he's teased for his methods by his other farmer friends.Once they found I was born in California, holy mackerel, they thought oh, says Hankins. You wouldn't imagine.Hankins says the bottom line for him is a healthy animal, producing meat that preserves the health of his family. The Food and Drug Administration is working on this issue. The agency is now phasing in veterinary oversight of certain antibiotics, requiring farmers to get a prescription before the drugs can be given to animals.", "title": "SPECIAL REPORT: Antibiotic Resistance", "publishedDate": "2013-05-02T04:52:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "5HlQfw5PWUM", "description": "", "title": "Cardiologie - Reflux H\u00e9pato-Jugulaire", "publishedDate": "2010-08-30T07:47:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Hm2pNlt8Dg", "description": "", "title": "Kera - \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438", "publishedDate": "2014-05-29T07:15:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Hm4tIPtRco", "description": "iTUNES: http://smarturl.it/tcm-know-hope\nMERCH: http://riserecords.merchnow.com/search/?q=the+color+morale\n\nwe are the same disease / one way too old / one way too young to treat / our feet stuck in the same concrete / we just want to be free / aren't you sick of knowing that you could truly be / something that stays and makes a difference before it leaves / aren't you sick of hearing all the pain in me / aren't you sick of being sick from the same disease / come to me with anything that you'll ever need / come to me when you're rebuilding / sometimes its good to build up walls / not to keep anyone out / but to see who cares enough to knock them down / we can start again with our names written in new cement / we can write the date right after we dig ourselves out of the messes we've made / you'll never know what you have until it's gone through hell for you / (chorus) / you'll never stop making mistakes but if you learn from them you will never make the same ones twice / next time there may be no next time / (chrous)", "title": "The Color Morale - Learned Behavior (Lyric Video)", "publishedDate": "2013-02-01T00:56:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Hm5abJVkUo", "description": "Subscribe to my new channel http://www.youtube.com/anotherclutch2\n\nI was playing MLG 50 high and for some odd reason my teammate decided to get mad at me when he was on my team and we were winning for apparently beasting on my host O_o.

The mixed drink tequila sunrise cocktail recipe is one of the most popular Tequila cocktails in the Tequila drink genre. It mostly uses \"well\" or bottom shelf tequila. Often times Mezcal. To be honest that really doesn't help make the cocktail better. It only masks the bitterness of the sub-par tequila. So we advise you make this drink with a mid to top shelf Tequila and a white or 'blanco\" one at that.\n\nto complete the mixed drink recipe you will need the following:\n\nTequila (preferably a blanco) 1 1/2 oz.\nOrange juice (fresh is best, but any should suffice)\ngrenadine (a float or 1/2 oz)\nGarnish with either a cherry or orange twist (we used both)\n\nFirst, In a Collins glass filled with ice pour in your 1 1/12 oz of blanco tequila. Next, fill almost to the top with your orange juice, then float your grenadine, and garnish with you cherry, orange twist or both and vio la!

The revolutionary patented Dynomax slide reamer integrates these phases saving time and money.\n\nThe cutting structure on the slide reamer is designed to maintain 360 degree contact. Cutters rotate independently, reducing torque and drag.\n\nThe slide reamer can be used for vertical, directional and horizontal holes eliminating drift or deviation.\nCutters clean the wellbore while sliding or rotating, maintaining integrity of the wellbore wall in any drilling operation.\n\nThe Dynomax Slide Reamer does just what it says - reams while sliding, and can also ream during drill string rotation. This continuous conditioning eliminates the need for a designated ream run. A slide reamer can be added to the drill string for multiple drilling applications.\n\nResearch shows that adding a Dynomax slide reamer results in a clear reduction of 15-20% in rotary torque over the same drill string running without a slide reamer.\n\nPreserve integrity, Protect equipment.

It has a whole host of uses for health issues and can be employed in a few beauty formulas as well. Yogurt. It's not just for breakfast anymore. (That was painfully clich\u00e9, I know, but it's true!)\n\nFermentation of lactose by one or more varieties of bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, and others) produces lactic acid  which turns milk into yogurt and gives it its texture and tangy taste. Those cultures also give yogurt its health-boosting qualities.\n\nLook for yogurt labeled with a \"Live and Active Cultures\" seal from the National Yogurt Association, indicating the product reliably contains at least 100 million active cultures per gram of yogurt. Opt for organic if you can afford it and it's available--and buy it in large containers to save on packaging, or make your own.\n\nhttp://www.superfoodhealthyliving.com/\nhttp://www.superfoodhealthyliving.com/raw-foods-blog/\nhttp://www.superfoodhealthyliving.com/raw-foods-blog/income-opportunity.html", "title": "11 Surprising Uses for Yogurt Part 1", "publishedDate": "2011-07-15T08:03:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "5IaoBYT-Yr0", "description": "For the full message, go to: http://gcmodesto.sermons.io/sermons/that-s-your-interpretation", "title": "Just and Justifier", "publishedDate": "2012-11-18T00:57:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Iat9IXegKo", "description": "Urmareste acest ghid Misiunea Casa despre etansarea rosturilor folosind Ceresit CS 25 - silicon sanitar.\nMai multe detalii gasiti pe: http://www.ceresit.ro/", "title": "Aplicare silicon sanitar", "publishedDate": "2011-01-10T13:40:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "5IaxdixBFV4", "description": "So I keep on screwing everything up with this video but maybe this is finally a version that works.\n\nYou'll notice a couple places where the video looks really choppy, that's because some of the frames got corrupted and I had to redo them once I noticed (which wasn't until the rest of the video was done).\n\nAnd, well, not a fan of how the danmaku turned out here, I'll have to work on my animating techniques.

In this video, we're going to be talking about used fireproof cabinets. Used fireproof cabinets are not glamorous to be sure, but they can save you more than $1400 per file cabinet. New four-drawer fireproof cabinets rated at one hour go for upwards of twenty two hundred dollars.\n\nWe have a great selection of used fireproof filing cabinets. They are all clean and UL rated to one hour in a blaze that reaches up to 1700 degrees Fahrenheit. This rating is the recommended rating for urban settings. Many of our firesafe cabinets are in like-new condition. If you're not concerned about the surface appearance of the file cabinet and would like to save additional money, we have others that have minimal cosmetic wear.\n\nFireproof file systems are rated by Underwriters Laboratories, an independent engineering organization that rates products for specific legal classifications for insurance companies. If your files are important, and you ensure them, your insurance underwriter may require that you purchase fireproof file cabinets and keep your files in them. Even if they do not require this, you may be able to get lower premiums by installing and using them in your office.\n\nWhile you may save money in the long run by lower premiums, the bottom line is, if your files are important enough to your organization for you to want to insure them, then it's a good idea to protect them. Information and records can form the foundation of certain organizations and often are not replaceable with an insurance payment.\n\nIf you have additional questions about used fireproof cabinets, or how to get a great value on other products for your office, we invite you to contact us and start the conversation.

Its constitutional importance, he adds 'cannot therefore be underestimated.'\n  \n'Practitioners today need to have a keen knowledge of a properly well-developed subject,' says Lord Dyson, a body of knowledge and insights which this book amply provides.  Taking account of the multiplicity of changes that have taken place in this field over the decades in practice and procedure, this book functions as an erudite and practical guide, which excels in accessibility as well as detail.\n\nExtensively examined in the book is the impact of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly, as the authors state 'those areas where Convention rights are likely to have an impact on the approach adopted to claims for judicial review, notably where such approaches may differ from the common law....' \n\nAspects of EU law particularly relevant to judicial review are also covered.  Especially useful are the no less than nine appendices which set out relevant legislation, including the Human Rights Act 1998 itself and the Equality Act 2019 section 49.  \n\nThe authors have, for the most part, confined their dissertation to the law and practice in England and Wales, the occasional exception being, for example, other areas of public law relevant to this text. \n\nDestined, certainly, to become a definitive work of reference in this area of law, this volume should be considered as a required acquisition for practitioners.  The law is stated as at January 2013.", "title": "Judicial Review", "publishedDate": "2013-04-27T15:07:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "5IyYXzzsrzM", "description": "VIDEO PRODUCED BY THE VOICE OF IRAU\u00c7UBA (PRESIDENT F\u00c9LIX VASCONCELOS)\nTHIS FORR\u00d3 IS SENSUAL ,  THIS SONG SAYS ABOUT A GIRL THAT IS VERY ACTIVE  ...

This results in a very high surface area, which increases the rate of adsorption on the surface of the material. Adsorption can be defined, as the process by which there is an adhesion of atoms, ions or molecules from a gas or a liquid to the surface of a solid. This adhesion will create a film of the adsorbate (smoke/air particles in this case) on the surface of the adsorbent. And, due to this, impurities and odours can be eliminated.  These molecules are trapped within the carbon structure either by electrostatic attraction (Van der Waals forces) or by chemisorption. Other particles, which are not as attracted to the carbon molecules, pass through undisturbed. As more and more molecules get adsorbed to the surface, the number of active sites of the carbon structure starts getting filled, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the charcoal.  That is why it needs to be replaced after a certain amount of time.\n\nThere are two types of adsorptions which are chemisorption and physisorption. Chemisorption is adsorption in which the forces involved are valence forces of the same kind as those operating in the formation of chemical compounds. Physisorption is adsorption in which the forces involved are intermolecular forces of the same kind as those responsible for the imperfection of real gases and the condensation of vapours. The phenomenon of chemisorption is characterized by chemical specificity whereas physisorption is a general one and occurs in any solid/fluid system, although certain specific molecular interactions may occur, arising from particular geometrical or electronic properties of the adsorbent and/or adsorptive.\n\nIn the experiment that we conducted, crushed charcoal is kept inside a container. We introduced smoke inside the container by using a lighted cigarette and covered the container with a lid in order to make sure that no smoke escapes the container. As we observe the container over a period of time, the smoke intensity starts to decrease until at the end there is a negligible amount of smoke present inside the container. Since no smoke can exit the container, this suggests that the smoke must have been adsorbed by the surface of the activated charcoal. This experiment demonstrates gas surface adsorption. The smoke particles (adsorbate molecules) come into contact with the surface of charcoal. These particles get trapped onto the surface, as they do not possess enough energy to leave the gas-surface potential wall. If the molecules collide elastically, they will return to the bulk gas. But, if they lose enough momentum through inelastic collision, then they sticks onto the surface and form a precursor state bonded to the surface by weak forces. There are many different applications of Activated charcoal such as water treatment and air purification. It can also be used in Industrial or medical applications.", "title": "Adsorption", "publishedDate": "2013-11-06T16:37:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "5JR1rPTQ29k", "description": "Qatar Airways inaugural detailled trip report to Kigali can be seen here : http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/trip_reports/read.main/227119/\n\nQR 536 first landing at Rwandan capital airport\n\nFull trip report is available here: \nhttp://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/trip_reports/read.main/227119\n\nEntebbe - Kigali\nAirbus A320 - 200\n21st of march 2012", "title": "Qatar Airways maiden flight Kigali  Airport + water canon salute", "publishedDate": "2012-03-24T14:02:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "5JS0RBb5zLM", "description": "bushbuck hunt\nbushbuck antelope\nbushbuck hunting with dogs\nbushbuck safaris\nbushbuck\nbushbuck safaris\nbushbuck hunting with hounds\nbushbuck images\nbushbuckridge\nbushbuckridge residents association\nbushbuck game\nbushbuck facts\nbushbuck images\nbushbuckridge", "title": "Bushbuck", "publishedDate": "2014-07-24T08:45:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "5JSCbEKsguQ", "description": "Belt :)\ncheck my music out.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id15BQDI8Lk", "title": "The Croods- Dun Dun Dun", "publishedDate": "2013-04-04T18:55:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "5JSF0-DbIRc", "description": "Inference of three-dimensional structure & motion from the fusion of inertial and visual sensory data must be robust to the many outliers typically present in images.

I arranged it for Halloween. Yay! When Udon gets dry, it's gluten gets strong and sticky, so I wrapped it around Tempura in that instant ;D\n\nFun and easy! Great for party and also for bento to surprise your honey. hehe\n\n---------------------------------\nMummy Shrimp (Ebi) Tempura Udon\n\nDifficulty: Easy\nTime: 20min\nNumber of servings: 6\n\nIngredients:\n6 Ebi (shrimp)\n60g Nissin Tempura flour \n100cc water\nvegetable oil for frying\n6 Nori sheet (cut the large sheet into 4 squares)\ncream cheese\nfrozen Udon noodles or pre-boiled Udon noodles\nsliced cheese and Nori sheet for eyes\nYamasa Konbu Tsuyu (3 times concentrated Konbu kelp seaweed soup stock) or Tentsuyu (Tempura dipping sauce)\n\nDirections:\n1. Shell shrimps (leave their tails), devein, and make incisions in their stomach side to straighten them. Then cut off the tip of the tail and remove the water inside to avoid splatters when frying.\n2. Mix Nissin Tempura flour and the water very well.\n3. Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan to 180~190C (340~350F). Lightly dip the shrimps in the batter and fry them immediately until golden and crisp. Drain Tempura on a rack or a sheet of clean paper towel. (Do not fry too many at once.) Cool down until you can touch.\n4. Boil Udon noodles as directed on package and drain well.\n5. Spread cream cheese on Nori sheet.\n6. Wrap shrimp Tempura with the Nori sheet. When Udon gets dry, it's gluten gets strong and sticky. In that instant, wrap Udon around the shrimp Tempura. \n7. Cut out sliced cheese and Nori sheet to make their eyes.\n8. Dilute 20cc Konbu Tsuyu with 40cc water (make as much as you want) and bring to a boil.\n9. Pour the Konbu Tsuyu over the Mummy Shrimp Tempura Udon and enjoy!\n\nYou can eat as cold noodles like Zaru Udon (chilled Udon noodles), or microwave before you eat.\n\nHow to make Tempura from scratch is here.\nhttp://createeathappy.blogspot.com/2008/10/tempura_22.html\n\nScroll down the page and see how other people made this ;D\nhttp://cookpad.com/recipe/291231\n\n\u30ec\u30b7\u30d4\uff08\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\uff09\nhttp://cooklabo.blogspot.com/2009/10/blog-post_30.html\n---------------------------------\n\nHappy Halloween :D\n\nThe products I used:\n\nNissin Tempura flour\uff08\u65e5\u6e05 \u30b3\u30c4\u306e\u3044\u3089\u306a\u3044\u5929\u3077\u3089\u7c89\uff09\nhttp://www.nisshin.com/products/detail/4902110340518.html\n\nYamasa's Konbu Tsuyu\uff08\u30e4\u30de\u30b5 \u6606\u5e03\u3064\u3086 \uff13\u500d\u6fc3\u7e2e - 3 times concentrated Konbu kelp seaweed soup stock\uff09\nhttp://www.yamasa.com/konbutsuyu/product/index.html\n\nMusic by\nDazie Mae\nThe Business Of Breaking Men's Hearts\nhttp://www.jamendo.com/en/\n\nFYI (products I used in my videos):\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/lm/R3VVDX7JZ5GYJE/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&linkCode=ur2&tag=shopping072-22\n\n\u2665Original T-SHIRTS\u2665\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFsQE0qd_4w\n\n\u2665My Recipe Posts in Japanese\u2665\nhttp://cooklabo.blogspot.jp/\nhttp://cookpad.com/ami\nhttp://www.lettuceclub.net/mypage/toukou_top.html?user_code=00153826\nhttp://twitter.com/alohaforever\n\n\u2665and of course SUBSCRIBE\u2665\nhttp://www.youtube.com/ochikeron", "title": "HALLOWEEN Mummy Ebi (Shrimp) Tempura Udon (Recipe) \u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u306b\u6d77\u8001\u5929\u3046\u3069\u3093 (\u30ec\u30b7\u30d4)", "publishedDate": "2011-10-14T06:12:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "5J_ZqejlO_4", "description": "Visit this site http://www.ridingwearonline.co.uk/Childrens_Jodphurs-cid-8-1.html for more information on Children\u2019s Jodhpurs.

It's Shawn here with RealTruck.com, and today we're installing a BAK Roll-X tonneau cover. \n\nThe first thing you want to do is wipe down the side and the front rails, knocking any dust or dirt off. Then peel the 3M backing off the rubber weather seal and start to place it onto the bulkhead of the truck. Make sure to press down firmly for a tight seal. \n\nTake your first rail and clamp it down loosely. The silver slotted bracket on the rail should be approximately one-quarter inch away from the bulkhead. Go ahead and attach all three clamps, checking the quarter inch spacing periodically. Then go ahead and repeat the exact same process on the other side. When the rails are installed, go ahead and position the Roll-X tonneau cover onto the rails towards the front of the truck bed. Then you can go ahead and slide the included bolts into the side of the extrusion under the front panel of the Roll-X cover. \n\nPosition the two square plastic washers over the bolts. Go ahead and unbuckle the straps. Lower the front panel of the Roll-X so that the bolts extend through the slotted plates. Put the strap and washer onto the bolt and start threading the knob. Make sure to leave it loose. \n\nNext you can go ahead and unroll the Roll-X to the end of the bed. Make sure that it is lined up so that it will easily latch.", "title": "How to Install a BAK Roll-X Truck Bed Cover", "publishedDate": "2012-07-11T14:09:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Jfh3AxUHz0", "description": "", "title": "What is Wilms Tumor?", "publishedDate": "2013-01-24T02:01:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "5JfuKpK_zfE", "description": "Check out the research projects created by UW students in the annual Undergraduate Research Symposium. \n\nUW 360 profiles the fascinating people, programs and community connections that define the University of Washington.

They stood firm for three whole months, losing 327 out of 490 men, including eight British officers.

Women from across the country visit our practice in St. Louis, Missouri to get the results they need utilizing noninvasive vaginal surgery as well as the most minimally invasive surgical procedures.  Our reputation speaks for itself -- over 500 surgeries each year, many of which are women who have come to us to repair the work from previous surgery.   We prefer to educate women and be their first choice for the best solution.\n\nLabiaplasty\nThe labiaplasty operation usually takes about 1 - 2 hours, and is normally treated as a day case, meaning that you are discharged to go home a few hours after your surgery is completed. There may be cases where an overnight stay is required.\nThe surgery can be performed in two ways, either by reducing the excess tissue along the edges of the labia by simply trimming along the inner folds until the labia no longer protrude, or by cutting out a 'V' shaped wedge of tissue from the underneath of the labia, the edges of which are then sewn back together. This method leaves the front of the labia unchanged, making the evidence of surgery less noticeable.\nSurgeons nowadays tend to use dissolvable stitches in this area to aid healing and reduce pain and discomfort. Some surgeons also use a laser rather than a scalpel for cutting to reduce bleeding in the area, as the laser cauterises blood vessels as it cuts.\nVaginoplasty\nThe vaginoplasty operation usually takes about 1 - 2 hours, and is treated as a day case, meaning that you are discharged to go home a few hours after your surgery is completed. There may be cases where an overnight stay is required.\nThe surgery is designed to tighten the vagina and is done by joining together the stretched muscle at the back of the vagina and therefore shortening it, using dissolvable stitches, and then removing excess vaginal lining (vaginal mucosa) and tightening the surrounding soft tissues. This procedure may also be done using a laser. The resulting decrease in the size of the vaginal cavity creates more friction during sexual intercourse, often described as giving a woman back the vagina she had before she had children. The G-spot is not affected by this procedure.\nHymenoplasty\nThe hymen is a membrane that partially obstructs the vaginal opening, and is believed by most scientists to have no known anatomical function whatsoever, but is simply a remnant from the development of the foetus into a girl in the womb. There are arguments that it serves as an infection barrier to the vagina in infancy but this is simply a hypothesis", "title": "Disgusting Bodies urogenital system season 2 episode 1", "publishedDate": "2014-05-18T11:34:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5JxibThUhgo", "description": "Uploaded using FlipShare.", "title": "Promote yourself!", "publishedDate": "2009-05-16T19:38:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "5JyOHS4-cMc", "description": "Demonstration of a sprung ogee / cyma recta moulding plane in use.

Amateur Theorist strives to strengthen that community by supplying a safe online destination for members to discuss, debate, and share their opinions of film theory.\n\nI founded this site with the ambition of creating an online resource that I could reference for my own personal study during my time at University of Toronto. However, I foresee a greater potential in this website, to serve as a resource not only for my own personal growth, but for the that of the entire online film community. And, as a team, we can become an even stronger, more diverse organization for film scholars everywhere.\n\nThis website will be predominantly run by a small team of writers and staff that will post content in the form of text publications, and podcasts. Please visit often, as there will be regular updates to the site. There are also active forums and comment sections that I encourage everyone to participate in.\n\nI would like to reinforce that this is not a business venture; this website is developed solely for the love of film with the intention to unite our community in an accessible and fun learning environment.

They also set up functional shoe storage to help Namatie keep her shoe collection looking brand new.\n\nWhat's IKEA Home Tour? We'll tell you! We're sending a team of IKEA experts on the road to help America solve real home furnishing challenges, big and small, and transform their living spaces. The Home Tour Squad is hitting the road to assist those who need help with home projects -- from closet organization to living room style upgrades to bedroom makeovers -- and to illustrate genuine solutions that make everyday life at home better. The Home Tour Squad will come up with a plan and go shopping for the furnishings and accessories needed at the local IKEA store. The homeowners and the Squad members will then accomplish the transformation together! Plus, the Squad will film their journey along the way.\n\nThe IKEA Home Tour Squad is a team of hand-selected IKEA experts from across the country. They specialize in everything from home design to organization to sustainability at home. Each Squad member comes from a different background and contributes their unique expertise to help homeowners on the tour.  Their journey will be chronicled through before/after makeover videos, tour footage, and video shorts featuring design tips and interviews with homeowners.  Squad members will also be sharing live updates from the tour via Twitter (@IKEAUSA) and Instagram (@IKEAUSA) with the hashtag #IKEAHomeTour.\n\nFor more inspirational ideas for your home, check out IKEA USA on:\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/IKEAUSA \n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/IKEAUSA\n\nPinterest - http://www.pinterest.com/IKEAUSA \n\nInstagram - http://www.instagram.com/IKEAUSA \n\nGoogle+ - https://plus.google.com/+IKEAUSA", "title": "Studio Apartment Makeover Ideas - IKEA Home Tour (Episode 109)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-17T18:11:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "5KT-FD-YgLg", "description": "Why does newspaper hate yearbook so much?

It's also a pretty simple process.\n\n\nStep 1: Place bandage & secure\nPlace the tail end of the bandage on the inside of the arm, just below the elbow, and wrap it around the arm twice to secure the bandage. You want it tight enough to apply pressure but to not cut off circulation.\n\nTip\nHave the victim bend the elbow slightly if they can do so without causing further pain or injury. This positioning will make the bandaging easier.\n\nStep 2: Wrap upward\nWrap upward, winding the bandage diagonally from the elbow toward the bicep.\n\nStep 3: Wrap figure eight\nWhen you reach the elbow, wrap a figure-eight pattern around the elbow so the X, or middle, of the figure eight is on the inside of your elbow, then continue upward.\n\nStep 4: Finish bandage\nWhen you reach the bicep, finish the bandage by completing two turns directly over one another, just like at the beginning, without moving the position of the bandage.\n\nStep 5: Use binding clips\nUse the binding clips found in the bandage packaging\u2014or apply a strip of adhesive tape\u2014to keep the bandage in place.\n\nTip\nAvoid anything that might increase swelling in the first 48 hours after an injury, like a hot shower or drinking alcohol.\n\nStep 6: Check circulation\nCheck for circulation by squeezing the tip one of the fingers on the injured arm and see how long it takes for color to come back to the fingertip.

Then draw a line around the bottle, connecting your marks. Using the craft knife, cut along the line to remove the bottom of the bottle.\n\nStep 2: Cut the middle of the bottle\nUse the same method and cut an 8-centimeter-wide section from the middle of the bottle. Measure, mark, and cut four 2-centimeter-wide strips from the center section, and use scissors to cut the strips in half so you have eight strips that measure 4 centimeters-by-2 centimeters.\n\nStep 3: Make the wheel\nDraw 8 evenly spaced lines around the cork and make slits through the lines using the knife. Then slide one of the plastic strips into each slit.\n\nTip\nMake sure the strips all curve in the same direction.\n\nStep 4: Cut the bottom section\nMeasure and mark 2 points on the rim of the bottom section, 12 centimeters apart. Then, measure 3 centimeters up from the bottom of the base section and make a point halfway between the points on the rim. Draw and cut a deep arc from one point on the rim, through the point in the middle, and back up to the second point on the rim.\n\nStep 5: Insert the skewer\nPoke 2 holes on opposite sides of the base, just below the rim. Then cut the skewer in half and thread each half through one of the holes and into the ends of the cork. Make sure that the skewer halves are wedged tightly into the cork and that they have room to spin in the holes in the bottle base.\n\nStep 6: Attach the other cork\nPush the other cork firmly onto the end of one of the skewers and tie one end of a length of thread around the cork. Then tie the loose end of the thread to a fishing sinker.\n\nTip\nIf you don't have a fishing sinker, you can use another weight.\n\nStep 7: Run the water\nPut your water wheel in a sink and turn on the water. Watch the water turn the wheel and see if it produces enough energy to wind the string around the cork and lift the sinker. Once you're able to lift the sinker, increase the weight and see how much you have to then increase the water pressure to lift it.\n\nDid You Know?\nHydropower was used as long ago as 100 BCE, when the Greeks and Romans placed vertical water wheels in streams or rivers to grind wheat and corn.", "title": "How to Make a Water Wheel", "publishedDate": "2011-03-09T15:07:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "5KwF95el9Ao", "description": "Does the coming reduction of the blown diffuser in Formula One give the Red Bull an advantage?

The fossils are arranged by approximate age as determined by radiometric dating and/or incremental dating. The species name represents current consensus, when there is no clear scientific consensus the other possible classifications are indicated; deprecated classifications may be found on the fossil's page. Most of the fossils shown are not considered direct ancestors to Homo sapiens but are closely related to direct ancestors and are therefore important to the study of the lineage. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_evolution_fossils\n\nFor purposes of discussion, let us assume 300,000,000 people died in the Flood, and that each one was preserved as a fossil evenly distributed in the sedimentary record, which consists of about 300,000,000 cubic miles. The chances of such a fossil intersecting the earth's surface, being found by someone, and then being properly and honestly identified is vanishingly small.\n\nOn the other hand, if evolution is true, and humans have lived on Earth for three million years, many trillions have lived and died. Where are their fossils? This is the more vexing question.", "title": "Still Waiting For Evidence Of Evolution", "publishedDate": "2011-04-27T09:01:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "5KybLot14Vg", "description": "more at http://kitchen.quickfound.net\n\nMrs. Eleanor Johnson from Englewood, New Jersey does the breakfast dishes after she gets home from work. Thanks to Cascade, she lives to tell the tale.\n\nPublic domain film from the Prelinger Archives, slightly cropped to remove uneven edges, with the aspect ratio corrected, and mild video noise reduction applied.\nThe soundtrack was also processed with volume normalization, noise reduction, clipping reduction, and/or equalization (the resulting sound, though not perfect, is far less noisy than the original).\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishwasher\n\nA dishwasher is a mechanical device for cleaning dishes and eating-utensils. Dishwashers can be found in restaurants and private homes.\n\nUnlike manual dishwashing, which relies largely on physical scrubbing to remove soiling, the mechanical dishwasher cleans by spraying hot water, typically between 55 and 75 \u00b0C (130 and 170 \u00b0F) at the dishes, with lower temperatures used for delicate items. A mix of water and detergent is circulated by a pump. Water is pumped to one or more rotating spray arms, which blast the dishes with the cleaning mixture. Once the wash is finished, the water is drained, more hot water is pumped in and a rinse cycle begins. After the rinse cycle finishes and the water is drained, a heating element in the bottom of the tub heats the air to dry the dishes. Sometimes a rinse aid is used to eliminate water spots for streak-free dishes...\n\nHistory\n\nThe first reports of a mechanical dishwashing device are of an 1850 patent...\n\nThe first reliable (hand-powered) dishwasher was invented in 1887 by Josephine Cochrane...\n\nIn England, William Howard Livens invented a small dishwasher suitable for domestic use in 1924. It was the first modern dishwasher, and incorporated most of the design elements that feature in the models of today...\n\nDespite this, Liven's design did not become a commercial success, and dishwashers were only successfully sold as domestic utilities in the postwar boom of the 1950s, albeit only to the wealthy. Initially dishwashers were sold as standalone or portable devices, but with the development of the wall-to-wall countertop and standardized height cabinets, dishwashers began to be marketed with standardized sizes and shapes, integrated underneath the kitchen countertop as a modular unit with other kitchen appliances.\n\nBy the 1970s dishwashers had become commonplace in domestic residences in North America and Western Europe. By 2012, over 75 percent of homes in the US and Germany had dishwashers...\n\nDifferent kinds of dishwashing detergent contain different combinations of the items in the list below. Not all of the ingredients below are used in some detergent.\n\n-    Phosphates\n-        Dissolves calcium and magnesium ions to prevent 'hard-water' type limescale deposits[citation needed] . They can cause ecological damage, so their use is starting to be phased out. Phosphate-free detergents are sold as eco-friendly detergents .\n\n-    Oxygen-based bleaching agents (older-style powders and liquids contain chlorine-based bleaching agents)\n-        Breaks up and bleaches organic deposits .\n\n-    Non-ionic surfactants\n        Lowers the surface tension of the water, emulsifies oil, lipid and fat food deposits, prevents droplet spotting on drying .\n\n-    Alkaline salts\n-        These are a primary component, in older and original-style dishwasher detergent powders[citation needed] . Highly alkaline salts attack and dissolve grease, but are extremely corrosive (fatal) if swallowed. Salts used may include metasilicates, alkali metal hydroxides, Sodium carbonate etc.\n\n-    Enzymes\n-        Breaks up and dissolves protein-based food deposits, and possibly oil, lipid and fat deposits. Proteases do this by breaking down the proteins into smaller peptides that are more easily washed away .\n\n-    Anti-corrosion agent(s)\n        Often sodium silicate, this prevents corrosion of dishwasher components .\n\nDishwashing detergent may also contain :\n\n-    Anti-foaming agents\n-        Foam interferes with the washing action.\n\n-    Additives to slow down the removal of glaze & patterns from glazed ceramics\n-    Perfumes\n-    Anti-caking agents (in granular detergent)\n-    Starches (in tablet based detergents)\n-    Gelling agents (in liquid/gel based detergents)\n-    Sand (inexpensive powdered detergents)\n\nDishwasher detergents are strongly alkaline (basic).\n\nInexpensive powders may contain sand, which can be verified by dissolving the powder in boiling water and then passing the solution through a coffee filter. Such detergents may harm the dishes and the dishwasher.

Video by Patrick Boni, July 27th, 2014\n\n5 persons : parents + 3 kids (4, 7, 9). 120km from Girolata to Saint-Florent. Wild camping. Full autonomy.\n\nCrew : Achille (9), Z\u00e9phyr (7), Calypso (4), Hortense (37), David (38)\nKayak : Wayland Ursus IV. Rig : Klepper S2. Outrigger : Careen\n\nItinerary:\n- july 25th:departure at 4:30am from our home in Geneva by bus with the folding sailing kayak (120kg of gear registered at the airpot luggage drop). Landing in Ajaccio at 7:25. Cab to Porticcio to take at 8:30 the day-tour boat to Scandola-Girolata-Piana. Step off the boat and unload the kayak at 12:45 in Girolata. Assemble the boat and first trial fully loaded at 5pm. Return to Girolata beach, last tunings and sleep on the beach,\n- July 26th: from Girolata to Focolara bay through the unique UNESCO classified natural reserve of Scandola (a 250 million year volcano which collapsed at the current sea level, host to many protected species). Meet another isolated kayakist named Patrick, from Sisco in Corsica who broke the right pedal of his fin-propelled triak. The weather forecast plans a stong wind from the South West. We can stay oe or two days in this remote area but if the wind persists, we need to go walking to Galeria, about 4h walk from Focolara Bay. At night, our food gets the interest of some wild pigs which get their head underneath the tent absid and escape in the Garrigue with their treasure.\n- July 27th : Patrick decides to return to Galeria (he had started the tour of Corsica with his triak 7 days earlier from Sisco, but his broken pedal and the bad weather  convinced him to get back) and helps us start off the beach, subject to high waves, announcing a strengthening wind). Both kayaks reach Galeria where we can refill our kayak trunks with fresh food. We separate from Patrick and start off for Crovani bay. The wind blows up by the end of the day and we arrive at full speed on a very steep beach, the wind coming from the stern (it was supposed to come from the opposite direction). All kids and wife are safe. A double check of the weather forecast confirms a high wind for the next 2-3 days. We decide to pack the boat and spend 1 day and one extra night in Crovani, also known for its old mine (called Argentella) operated by the British from the middle of the 19th century up to 1903.\n- July 28-29-30: 3 days off in calvi due to the excess of wind. We ordered a large cab between Crovani and Calvi and from Calvi to IIe Rousse to carry our kayak.\n- July 31st: Assemble the boat in Ile Rousse, fill the water tanks and kayak trunk with fresh food and start off to the Desert des Agriates. The sea is strong and the wind takes us to the sheltered bay of Aciolu. The beach is stuck between sea and cliff and we expect the waves won't be too strong at night to smash the boat and the tent against the cliff. We secure the food to avoid any uwanted visit of starving wild pigs at night and spend a relatively good night. The weather forecast is OK.\n- August the 1st: start from Aciolu with a wind from North (it was supposed to come from South-West which would have been great with our route). Consequently, we have to make Z turns to go upwing and help the boat by paddling for 4 hours. We eventually reach a lovely beach called Malfaciu, an excellent shelter wherever the wind comes from. The kids spend 3h in a very shallow and warm water investigatig every stone, fish or crab of the bay. We start off again with eventually a favorable wind to a breathtaking beach called Trave. We pitch the tent there and have a memorable family swim in the unique water colors of the Agriates.\n- August 2nd: start off with a stern wind in direction of Saleccia beach. We make a stop in Loto Beach where we meet Helen and her friend, 2 young teenagers of 65 who have been wandering across the Agriates for the last 3 weeks. We eat our last piece of fresh food there and check if there is some GSM signal to call the Hotel Bellevue and check if there is a room for us one night in advance. Hopefully, there is one, and we start for the last part of our trip. Midway across the Saint Florent bay, when we can see the buildings dowtown saint-Florent, we call the hotel again to check where we can land as close as possible from the hotel. We finally hit the ground right in front of the stairs to the hotel. The trip is over. \n\nI have not measured the distance, but I would say we covered around 120km out of 5 days of paddling/sailing. The head wind we had the first days delayed quite a bit the hour of arrival on our destination points. 2 years ago, from Ajaccio to Bonifaccio, we had a stern wind everytime and covered 180 km in only 5 days of sailing.", "title": "Family Kayak Trek - Corsica - August 2014 - Wayland kayak", "publishedDate": "2014-08-19T13:31:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "5L22WhZ56PU", "description": "Otha Cooper & Imogene Riggens\n'There's A Man Going Around Taking Names'\nRecorded in 1981 by Art Rosenbaum\n'Art Of Field Recording Volume II'", "title": "Otha Cooper & Imogene Riggens - There's A Man Going Around Taking Names (1981)", "publishedDate": "2012-02-13T23:07:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "5L2JK-MFjno", "description": "1000 Hz hertz (1 kHz) tone, frequency, sound test\ndigital sine wave\n60 sec duration", "title": "1000 Hz hertz Tone Sound Test", "publishedDate": "2012-03-01T03:10:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "5L2a53UEfj0", "description": "visit http://www.moneyledgers.com to download this program for FREE!

Developed by Valve Corporation, Dota 2 was released as a free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in July 2013, concluding a Windows-only public beta testing phase that began in 2011. The game is available exclusively through Valve's content-delivery platform, Steam.\n\nDota 2 is played in discrete matches involving two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. Each stronghold contains a building called the \"Ancient\", which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. Each player controls a \"Hero\" character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.\n\nDevelopment of Dota 2 began in 2009, when the developer of the DotA mod, IceFrog, was hired by Valve as lead designer. Dota 2 was praised by video game critics, who lauded its rewarding gameplay, enhanced production quality and faithfulness to its predecessor. However, the game was criticized for its steep learning curve and inhospitable community. Dota 2 has become the most actively played game on Steam, with daily peaks of over 800,000 concurrent players\n\nGAMEPLAY : \nDota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena game; its gameplay focuses on combat in a three-dimensional environment, presented from an oblique high-angle perspective. The player may command a single controllable character called a \"Hero\", which is chosen from a selection pool of 108. Each Hero begins the match at level one but may become more powerful by accumulating experience through combat, thereby leveling up. With every level gained\u2014the maximum is twenty-five\u2014the player may either select a new ability for their Hero to learn or enhance their general statistics. The Hero's methods of combat are influenced by their primary property \u2013 Strength, Agility, or Intelligence.\n\nDota 2 features a host of items, which the player may store in a small inventory. Said items may be acquired predominantly through purchase by gold, the in-game currency. Items vary in function: some enhance the statistics of a Hero, while others grant additional abilities. The player automatically receives small increments of gold continuously, though they can obtain more by destroying enemies. Killing non-player characters grants gold only to the player who lands the final blow, whereas killing enemy Heroes grants gold to the player's nearby allies as well. Destroying Towers or killing Roshan gives gold to all players on the team. \"Denying\" is a feature of the game where players inhibit the enemy's ability to accumulate gold and experience by killing an allied unit or destroying an allied structure before the enemy can do so. \"Warcraft: Orcs & Humans (Video Game)\" \"Warcraft III: Reign Of Chaos (Video Game)\"", "title": "Dota 2 - Patch 6.82 Chen + Aghanim's Scepter = Ancient Creeps!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-09-24T06:05:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "5L8kywbAsEo", "description": "Having a bad day,well this video will make it all go away.", "title": "kittens kittens and more kittens", "publishedDate": "2012-05-09T23:41:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "5L8qOSeIZfI", "description": "Battaglia Porto TCT con RAMMSTEIN (20/11/2013)\nCarro: Lacerta\nMotivo: Attacco +75%\nDecalcomania: Corazza +75%\nTorretta: Liv. 9 - Canna: Liv. 15 - Corazza: Liv. 6 - Motore: Liv. 10 - Cingoli: Liv.12", "title": "QUINTO\u2606DIAS [ITALIAN\u2605FORCE] Porto TCT - Movie 5 \"Original Sounds\"", "publishedDate": "2013-11-20T19:21:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "5L9AHXRPZwA", "description": "IIf you're doing a valley on an asphalt-shingle roof, you could try to eyeball those long cuts and make the cuts free hand, but there's a better way.\n\nWatch all of Fine Homebuilding's \"There's a Better Way\" video tips:\nhttp://www.finehomebuilding.com/blog/homebuilding-video-tips-with-chuck-miller\n\nBrought to you by Fine Homebuilding magazine and http://www.finehomebuilding.com.", "title": "Asphalt-Shingle Cutting Guide", "publishedDate": "2013-09-13T19:16:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "5L9Bqu17LDw", "description": "Copycat Tamil Movies Madras and Kathi Stories | Copycat Heros and Directors \n\nFor More Tamil Cinema Updates visit http:\\\\www.imn4u.com", "title": "Copycat Tamil Movies Madras and Kathi Stories | Copycat Heros and Tamil Directors", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T11:40:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "5L9oa8SS9eM", "description": "Music and lyrics:\nEmma Asatryan\narrangement:\nVahagn Hakobyan\nVIVAT\ndance studio\nstyle\nFAINA\ndirected by:\nArtyom Abovyan", "title": "Mona - Das Chem Anelu -  HD[2013] -  OFFICIAL", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T11:36:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "5LAA6lF6uFI", "description": "Become a Fan - http://on.fb.me/TPHBFacebook \nFollow on Twitter - http://bit.ly/TPHBTwitter \n\nSee Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers Live - http://bit.ly/TPHB2012Tour \n\nThe official music video for Jefferson Jericho Blues, from the new album Mojo by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, available June 15, 2010.\u00a9 2010 WMG", "title": "Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers - Jefferson Jericho Blues [OFFICIAL VIDEO]", "publishedDate": "2010-05-29T01:35:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "5LAJ2Jf4m3w", "description": "spinifer", "title": "heterometrus", "publishedDate": "2007-05-19T19:05:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "5LAO0siKU8I", "description": "Enlace para descargar Vapour:\nhttp://www.skobbejakgames.com/Download.html\n\nS\u00edgueme en Twitter! :)\nhttps://twitter.com/anymus2\n\nSuscribios a mi canal para nuevos videos:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/Anymus2\n\nGracias a todos por ver el video.\nVotar y comentar vuestra opini\u00f3n :D", "title": "Juegos Gratis para PC | Vapour", "publishedDate": "2013-08-26T18:53:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "5LA_003Pr_8", "description": "Taylor responds to @ejkraft to show the Preston in Whiskey Tortoise and Neville in Blue Marblewood. \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/warbyparker\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WarbyParker\n\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/WarbyParkerHelp?feature=watch\n\nFor more Warby Parker, float on over to http://warby.me/C88Mi", "title": "The Preston and Neville Frames | Warby Parker", "publishedDate": "2013-02-23T02:24:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5LAme4WQJ9o", "description": "Nutria salvaje acical\u00e1ndose en Ba\u00f1ado de Rocha con fondo de pareja de Chaj\u00e1es", "title": "Myocastor(Nutria) y Chauna Torquata(Chaj\u00e1) wilds in Rocha (Uruguay)", "publishedDate": "2012-02-22T00:41:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "5LBBVqruNoQ", "description": "Field Worker at \u3082\u3063\u304d\u308a\u3084 2013.6.22\uff08\u30ea\u30cf\u6620\u50cf\uff09", "title": "\u7d42\u308f\u308a\u306e\u306a\u3044\u65c5", "publishedDate": "2013-12-31T12:59:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "5LByE79Ftrg", "description": "", "title": "Gary Skyner voice-over artist and comedy script writer", "publishedDate": "2013-05-28T22:17:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "5LC4_4Pr0Nc", "description": "My S-Video cable arrived today, modded for PAL N64 consoles to reduce the huge brightness issue that plagues most S-Video cables for PAL consoles.\nTo my dismay, my AverTV Capture HD card would not pick up the display or the sound with the S-Video cable.

For the film, see Alien Abduction (film). For the amusement ride marketed under this name, see Gravitron.\nUncanny things are thought to happen at night in desolate places\n\nThe terms alien abduction or abduction phenomenon describe \"subjectively real memories of being taken secretly against one's will by apparently nonhuman entities and subjected to complex physical and psychological procedures\".[1] People claiming to have been abducted are usually called \"abductees\" or \"experiencers\".\n\nDue to a paucity of objective physical evidence, most scientists and mental health professionals dismiss the phenomenon as \"deception, suggestibility (fantasy-proneness, hypnotizability, false memory syndrome), personality, sleep paralysis, psychopathology, psychodynamics [and] environmental factors\".[2] However, the late Prof. John E. Mack, a respected Harvard University psychiatrist, devoted a substantial amount of time to investigating such cases and eventually concluded that the only phenomenon in psychiatry that adequately explained the patients' symptoms in several of the most compelling cases was posttraumatic stress disorder.[dubious -- discuss] As he noted at the time, this would imply that the patient genuinely believed that the remembered frightening incident had really occurred.[citation needed]\n\nSkeptic Robert Sheaffer sees similarity between the aliens depicted in early science fiction films, in particular, Invaders From Mars, and some of those reported to have actually abducted people.[3]\n\nTypical claims involve being subjected to a forced medical examination that emphasizes their reproductive system.[4] Abductees sometimes claim to have been warned against environmental abuse and the dangers of nuclear weapons.[5] While many of these claimed encounters are described as terrifying, some have been viewed as pleasurable or transformative.\n\nThe first alien abduction claim to be widely publicized was the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961.[6] Reports of the abduction phenomenon have been made around the world, but are most common in English speaking countries, especially the United States.[3] The contents of the abduction narrative often seem to vary with the home culture of the alleged abductee.[3]\n\nAlien abductions have been the subject of conspiracy theories and science fiction storylines (notably The X-Files) that have speculated on stealth technology required if the phenomenon were real, the motivations for secrecy, and that alien implants could be a possible form of physical evidence. Mainstream scientists reject claims that the phenomenon literally occurs as reported. However, there is little doubt that many apparently stable persons who report alien abductions believe their experiences were real.[8] As reported in the Harvard University Gazette in 1992, Dr. John E. Mack investigated over 800 claimed abductees and \"spent countless therapeutic hours with these individuals only to find that what struck him was the 'ordinariness' of the population, including a restaurant owner, several secretaries, a prison guard, college students, a university administrator, and several homemakers ... 'The majority of abductees do not appear to be deluded, confabulating, lying, self-dramatizing, or suffering from a clear mental illness,' he maintained.\"[9] \"While psychopathology is indicated in some isolated alien abduction cases,\" Stuart Appelle et al. confirmed, \"assessment by both clinical examination and standardized tests has shown that, as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence.\"[10] Other experts who have argued that abductees' mental health is no better or worse than average include psychologists John Wilson and Rima Laibow, and psychotherapist David Gotlib.[11]\n\nSome abduction reports are quite detailed. An entire subculture has developed around the subject, with support groups and a detailed mythos explaining the reasons for abductions: The various aliens (Greys, Reptilians, \"Nordics\" and so on) are said to have specific roles, origins, and motivations. Abduction claimants do not always attempt to explain the phenomenon, but some take independent research interest in it themselves and explain the lack of greater awareness of alien abduction as the result of either extraterrestrial or governmental interest in cover-up.", "title": "PART 0025 2010 BEST BEST OF cruisinwithkenny COLORADO  LIVING IN MY TRUCK ON THE Continental Divide", "publishedDate": "2013-10-04T19:41:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5LVgcj1W0bs", "description": "", "title": "Garden in the coniferous forest", "publishedDate": "2014-04-09T10:08:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "5LVz_4VRjHk", "description": "", "title": "Saludos  a Maranatha Chicago un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s - Nahum Rosario", "publishedDate": "2013-08-12T16:24:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "5LWE2HF1v1Y", "description": "Strategies for getting started with cooperative learning", "title": "Tips on Cooperative Learning", "publishedDate": "2009-05-09T03:54:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "5LWOKWFdkPg", "description": "March 10th, 2012 - Hunting with Michael McKinny of West Texas Hunting Organization in the mountains east of El Paso I shot this free ranging Aoudad from 320 yards with my 7 Mag.
