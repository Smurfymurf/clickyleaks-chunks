The condition can be caused by a viral, fungal or bacterial infection. Bacterial meningitis is caused by a number of different types of bacteria, many of which are commonly found in the environment and even with people without causing the host harm.\n\nBacterial meningitis is usually severe and while most people recover, it can cause serious complications, such as brain damage, hearing loss or learning disabilities.  In the United States, approximately 500 deaths occur each year due to the condition.\n\nThere are several types of bacteria that cause bacterial meningitis.  In the United States the leading causes include: Haemophilus influenzae (most often caused by type b, Hib), Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis. \n\nSome of these bacteria can be contagious and be spread to other people. This usually happens when there is close or long contact with a sick person or due to direct contact with a sick person's oral secretions. Unlike most causes of bacterial meningitis, you can get Listeria monocytogenes by eating contaminated food.\n\nThere are also factors that can increase one's risk of developing bacterial meningitis.  They include:\n\n\u2022 Age: Infants are at higher risk for bacterial meningitis than people in other age groups. However, people of any age are at risk. \n\u2022 Community Settings: Infectious diseases tend to spread more quickly where larger groups of people gather together. \n\u2022 Medical Conditions: There are certain diseases, medications and surgical procedures that may weaken the immune system or increase the risk of meningitis.\n\u2022 Travel: Travelers to the certain regions of the globe may be at higher risk of developing the condition.\n\nBacterial meningitis can usually be treated effectively with antibiotics with early treatment.\n\nThese are just a few things to know about bacterial meningitis, to learn more about microbial pathogens or other health and safety, occupational or indoor air quality issues, please visits the websites shown on the screen.", "title": "Bacterial Meningitis", "publishedDate": "2013-08-02T15:48:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "7JEaRvTP09I", "description": "MVP's theme song for WWE\n\n\ncomment and rate please and on my other videos please =]\n\n\u00a9Glitter~Kiss Productions", "title": "MVP Theme Song WWE", "publishedDate": "2008-01-04T02:42:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "7JEmczSspWU", "description": "", "title": "Goca Trzan - Seti se mene budi drug", "publishedDate": "2011-04-16T16:07:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "7JF2Q6LxDhI", "description": "C\u00f3d. 206 - C\u00c1LCIO + MAGN\u00c9SIO + VITAMINA D: Forever Calcium\nComplemento \u00e0 base de c\u00e1lcio, magn\u00e9sio e vitamina \"D\".

In the last 13 years, at least 12 babies between the ages of one and four months have died when they suffocated in positioners, or when they became trapped between a sleep positioner and the side of their crib or bassinet.  \n\nPeople have been using positioners to keep their babies in certain positions when they sleep.  Some positioners are flat pads with side bolsters.  Others are inclined like a wedge, or have some other design.  These products may be promoted to reduce acid reflux, minimize \"flat head\" syndrome, or even to prevent sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).  But there is no scientific evidence to support any of these claims.\n\nMany parents and other people who care for babies know that babies should be placed on their backs to sleep. This reduces the chance of SIDS by nearly half. They may worry about how to make sure their babies stay on their backs.  But once babies are able to roll over onto their tummies, it is okay to leave them there, because babies who can flip over can also turn their heads, which reduces their chance of suffocation.  However, if babies flip over or scoot around while in a sleep positioner, they can have a hard time freeing their faces from the device or they can become trapped between the positioner and the side of their crib or bassinet.\n\nSo do not use infant sleep positioners.  They are not necessary, and they can be dangerous.  Put your baby to sleep on his or her back, and keep the crib free of pillows, comforters, quilts and toys.  That way, your baby has room to safely move or turn while sleeping.  Here is an easy way to remember - follow the ABCs of safe sleep - Alone on the Back in a bare Crib.\n\nAnd if you have any questions, contact your child's healthcare provider.\n\nFDA Patient Safety News: December 2010\n\nFor more information, please see our website:\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/psn/transcript.cfm?show=105#8\n[vpmedicaldevices]", "title": "FDA and CPSC: Don't Use Infant Sleep Positioners", "publishedDate": "2011-02-01T20:49:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "7JJE8KnaGjw", "description": "http://allmovielists.com/nazi-zombie-movies for more Nazi Zombie Movies", "title": "Outpost trailer 2007", "publishedDate": "2011-10-08T22:08:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "7JJKp-apNtA", "description": "http://deanethridge.com/tribe-pro-review/ What is Content Syndication?

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time.

When I first started acting to Odyssey, the greatest purpose of my videos was showing off the split screen technique and enjoying that, and while doing that, I taught myself to act more with expressions than actions, because I had very limited space with the split screen. But now, when I'm not using it, I've learned how much better acting I can produce when I let myself feel the scene and move as I see fit. You'll notice that Jason moves more than most characters, and it felt very natural. The 'drop the company line' part is especially my favorite. Tasha was just cool because of her outfit and wig. I hope to play her again soon!\n\nSome day I dream of having a studio with many backgrounds where I can just create a realistic looking hotel room, and then the next day turn it into a dining room if need be. But until that day, I must work with the backgrounds I have, and though the setting for this scene isn't accurate to the actual scene, it was the best I could do. Hopefully it will be forgettable in favor of the acting/costumes/etc. I actually filmed this at my church, which you'll probably recognize from the Malachi's Message scene - and, lesser recognizably, New Year's Eve Live. I was actually able to film two scenes there so next Sunday there will be a scene featuring Monica. And both the wig for Tasha used in this video and the wig I use for Monica were Birthday/Christmas presents last year and they haven't gotten much use since. Tasha's was used for Mary in the BTB scene but that's all so far. I look forward to much more use for them :)\n\nEnjoy!", "title": "AIO - The Search for Whit I - Don't you trust me?", "publishedDate": "2014-04-20T18:12:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Ja08-QhauM", "description": "Don't Litter kiddies.\n\nMake sure you comment, like, and maybe even subscribe!\nCheck out the team: https://www.youtube.com/user/TeamSmores", "title": "Litterbug", "publishedDate": "2014-07-16T01:39:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Ja5rr8CdpE", "description": "In che modo reagiranno i cittadini triestini di fronte alla pratica, preceduta dalla teoria, di due giovani parrucchieri tirocinanti?\n\nNon essendo gli unici in Italia ad aver proposto questo \"prank\" statunitense, vi consigliamo di dare un'occhiata ai video degli Stingers e di Maurizio Valente.

They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae, are the most widespread species of the genus Bos, and are most commonly classified collectively as Bos primigenius. Cattle are raised as livestock for meat (beef and veal), as dairy animals for milk and other dairy products, and as draft animals (oxen or bullocks) (pulling carts, plows and the like). Other products include leather and dung for manure or fuel. In some countries, such as India, cattle are sacred. From as few as 80 progenitors domesticated in southeast Turkey about 10,500 years ago, an estimated 1.3 billion cattle are in the world today. In 2009, cattle became the first livestock animal to have a fully mapped genome.\nCattle were originally identified as three separate species: Bos taurus, the European or \"taurine\" cattle (including similar types from Africa and Asia); Bos indicus, the zebu; and the extinct Bos primigenius, the aurochs. The aurochs is ancestral to both zebu and taurine cattle. Recently, these three have increasingly been grouped as one species, with Bos primigenius taurus, Bos primigenius indicus and Bos primigenius primigenius as the subspecies.\nComplicating the matter is the ability of cattle to interbreed with other closely related species. Hybrid individuals and even breeds exist, not only between taurine cattle and zebu (such as the sanga cattle, Bos taurus africanus), but also between one or both of these and some other members of the genus Bos -- yaks (the dzo or yattle), banteng, and gaur. Hybrids such as the beefalo breed can even occur between taurine cattle and either species of bison, leading some authors to consider them part of the genus Bos, as well. The hybrid origin of some types may not be obvious -- for example, genetic testing of the Dwarf Lulu breed, the only taurine-type cattle in Nepal, found them to be a mix of taurine cattle, zebu, and yak.[8] However, cattle cannot successfully be hybridized with more distantly related bovines such as water buffalo or African buffalo.\n\nThe aurochs originally ranged throughout Europe, North Africa, and much of Asia. In historical times, its range became restricted to Europe, and the last known individual died in Masovia, Poland, in about 1627. Breeders have attempted to recreate cattle of similar appearance to aurochs by crossing traditional types of domesticated cattle, creating the Heck cattle breed.\n\n\"Cattle\" did not originate as the term for bovine animals. It was borrowed from Anglo-Norman catel, itself from Latin caput, head, and originally meant movable personal property, especially livestock of any kind, as opposed to real property (the land, which also included wild or small free-roaming animals such as chickens \u2014 they were sold as part of the land). The word is closely related to \"chattel\" (a unit of personal property) and \"capital\" in the economic sense. The term replaced earlier Old English feoh \"cattle, property\" (cf. German: Vieh, Gothic: faihu).\n\nThe word \"cow\" came via Anglo-Saxon c\u016b (plural c\u0233), from Common Indo-European g\u02b7\u014dus (genitive g\u02b7owes) = \"a bovine animal\", compare Persian g\u00e2v, Sanskrit go, Welsh buwch.[citation needed] The genitive plural of c\u016b is c\u0233na, which gave the now archaic English plural of \"kine\". The Scots language singular is coo or cou, and the plural is \"kye\".\n\nIn older English sources such as the King James Version of the Bible, \"cattle\" refers to livestock, as opposed to \"deer\" which refers to wildlife. \"Wild cattle\" may refer to feral cattle or to undomesticated species of the genus Bos. Today, when used without any other qualifier, the modern meaning of \"cattle\" is usually restricted to domesticated bovines.\nCattle have one stomach with four compartments, the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum, with the rumen being the largest compartment. The reticulum, the smallest compartment, is known as the \"honeycomb\". Cattle sometimes consume metal objects which are deposited in the reticulum and irritation from the metal objects causes hardware disease. The omasum's main function is to absorb water and nutrients from the digestible feed. The omasum is known as the \"many plies\". The abomasum is like the human stomach; this is why it is known as the \"true stomach\".\n\nDairy farming and the milking of cattle was once performed largely by hand, but is now usually replaced by machine\nCattle are ruminants, meaning their digestive systems allows use of otherwise indigestible foods by regurgitating and rechewing them as \"cud\". The cud is then reswallowed and further digested by specialised microorganisms in the rumen.", "title": "Brazilian Rustic Cattle", "publishedDate": "2013-11-10T19:29:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "7JiVpM86oSI", "description": "During Dion's interview with Steve Paiken on The Agenda, noted columnist Andrew Coyne argues that Dion would make the best Liberal Leader and that Ignatieff's proposal to recognize Quebec nationhood as \"disastrous in itself\"", "title": "Coyne endorses Dion", "publishedDate": "2006-10-24T22:02:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Jii27lMnbk", "description": "Cover del tema de GianMarco y Obie Berm\u00fadez, \"Me Cans\u00e9 de Ti\", como un peque\u00f1o homenaje a su m\u00fasica, \u00a1ojal\u00e1 lo disfruten! :) #MaderaSepia2014.\n\nImaginantes Films 2014\nDirecci\u00f3n y edici\u00f3n: Oscar Ort\u00edz \nFotograf\u00eda: Jorge Roque.\n\nwww.facebook.com/maderasepia\nwww.twitter.com/maderasepia\nwww.soundcloud.com/maderasepia", "title": "Me Cans\u00e9 de Ti (Cover GianMarco) - Madera Sepia", "publishedDate": "2014-06-19T00:58:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "7JjPLgesvtg", "description": "1.5 tons of pressure splits wood easily by simply stepping on the foot plate and using body weight to depress the lever.

Dotado de grandes cualidades, es el animal indicado para muchos amantes de los perros.\nA juzgar por lo que dicen algunos ingeniosos cin\u00f3filos, el origen del golden retriever parece un tanto curioso. Buena prueba de ello es que en 1858, sir Dudley Marjoribanks asisti\u00f3 a un n\u00famero de un circo ambulante en Brighton, una ciudad veraniega de Inglaterra. Se trataba de un grupo de perros sabios, ojeadores del C\u00e1ucaso o pastores guardianes de reba\u00f1os de ovejas. Sir Dudley qued\u00f3 tan impresionado por la inteligencia y belleza de los perros que decidi\u00f3 comprar un par. El adiestrador no estaba dispuesto a vend\u00e9rselos pretextando que el n\u00famero se le vendr\u00eda abajo. Entonces, sir Dudley le ofreci\u00f3 comprarle el circo entero, y as\u00ed fue c\u00f3mo los perros se quedaron en las tierras de su nuevo due\u00f1o y se convirtieron en los ancestros de la raza.\nEsta historia tiene todas las caracter\u00edsticas de una bonita leyenda. Contiene los suficientes detalles precisos (fecha y lugar, principalmente) para que no se ponga en duda la verosimilitud del hecho esencial, aunque, sin embargo, quedan algunas cuestiones sin aclarar. En efecto, \u00bfqu\u00e9 pueden tener en com\u00fan un perro de circo y un retriever, a pesar incluso de que se tenga constancia de que el n\u00famero de los perros sabios antecesores del golden consist\u00eda precisamente en buscar en los rincones m\u00e1s inimaginables los objetos que escond\u00eda el adiestrador? \u00bfC\u00f3mo eran esos perros rusos, calificados a la vez de ojeadores y de pastores guardianes de reba\u00f1os? Aunque no hayamos podido verificar cu\u00e1l era su utilizaci\u00f3n en el C\u00e1ucaso natal a pesar de todo se puede afirmar sin temor a equivocarse que all\u00ed deberian ser como en cualquier otro lugar, es decir, que un perro de caza no deber\u00eda estar muy indicado para realizar el trabajo de un perro de pastor de la misma manera que un perro de pastor no es un perro de caza. De modo que no parece posible que haya existido una raza capaz de desenvolverse bien en esas dos disciplinas tan diferentes.\n\nAs\u00ed se descubri\u00f3 que un semental llamado Nous (con sesera, en ingles), de color amarillo, salido retriever de pelo plano, cubri\u00f3 una hembra de capa fuego de tama\u00f1o bastante peque\u00f1o, de raza tweed-water-spaniel. De dicha uni\u00f3n nacieron cuatro cachorros: Crocus, Primrose, Cowslip y Ada, que figuran como los verdaderos fundadores de la raza golden retriever.\nEn apoyo de esta versi\u00f3n cabe observar que algunas caracter\u00edsticas de los spaniels no entran en contradicci\u00f3n con las del golden , sobre todo en lo que respecta a su formato claramente rectangular y al pelaje y que las escasas lagunas que comporta dicha versi\u00f3n se podr\u00edan colmar f\u00e1cilmente. Por lo que respecta al tipo del spaniel llamado tweed-water, el hecho de que un solo spaniel de agua, el irish water-spaniel, haya podido mantenerse sin problemas hasta hoy no significa que no existieran otros a comienzos del siglo XIX; en este sentido, se podr\u00eda pensar que fue la creaci\u00f3n de los retriever a mediados del siglo \u00faltimo lo que aceler\u00f3 su desaparici\u00f3n. En un per\u00edodo como aqu\u00e9l en que la cinofilia a\u00fan estaba en mantillas, solo se reconoc\u00edan dos tipos de spaniels que eran perros de busca en el radio de la escopeta que no tomaban la muestra sino que se met\u00edan en los zarzales y cobraban las piezas, se distingu\u00edan los land-spaniels, que trabajaban en tierra, y los water-spaniels, utilizados en los humedales.", "title": "el golden retriever", "publishedDate": "2014-01-15T18:07:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Jlq0wmdIBc", "description": "Another song by the Gunny Sack Revue.", "title": "Matt Gingerich Sings \"Mr. Jones\"", "publishedDate": "2014-08-21T17:41:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "7JmCmCAYFec", "description": "Create Cake Magic!

And you can see that the gluten is forming. It's really stretchy. It's partially stretchy, because we added poolish, and poolish adds extensibility to the dough. And you can see we've got a really beautiful window pane going on. \n\nWe probably need to knead it a little bit more, but I'm really happy with that, so we'll knead it for another minute. The window pane test, basically is a check to see how the gluten is developing in the dough, and if all of the gluten is being developed you can really stretch the dough out. Because what the gluten does is it provides extensibility i.e., stretchiness, and also elasticity. \n\nAnd so it's that extensibility that you're looking for in the gluten, so you're checking to see how much you can stretch the dough. So once your baguette dough is kneaded, you're going to transfer it into a lightly-oiled bowl, and then it's going to ferment for a total of two hours, and we're going to punch it down or turn it, after one hour. \n\nAll right, so the baguette dough has fermented for one hour and we're going to punch it down or turn it, and so basically, I'm going to give it a letter fold. I'm going to rotate the bowl 90 degrees, and fold it again like a letter, and then flip the dough upside down and that's called turning. You can see this has a nice extensibility to it, which is really what you want when you're making a baguette dough. It will help with our shaping and then flip this upside down, and then I'm going to let this ferment for one more hour and then we will divide and shape it.", "title": "How to Knead, Ferment & Turn Baguette Dough | Make Bread", "publishedDate": "2013-06-20T21:15:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "7JmhvVrpHwY", "description": "Video to help clear up things about Cannoneers and the events about it :)", "title": "Maplestory Cannoneer Link Skill + Job adv", "publishedDate": "2011-12-18T12:46:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "7JnM51VPpnk", "description": "La vid\u00e9o du jour chaque matin \u00e0 7h sur : http://www.01netTV.com\n\nCette enceinte portable Bluetooth s\u00e9duit par sa forme cylindrique et par sa tr\u00e8s bonne autonomie", "title": "Test du Stell\u00e9 Audio Couture The Pillar, une enceinte au design \u00e9tonnant", "publishedDate": "2014-11-21T16:00:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Jnqb-r4Y9g", "description": "The Nature Boys with 'Non-aggression Pact',  filmed live at Cabaret Voltaire, Edinburgh on friday 31.7.09. \n(YEBOAH is for Paul Haddow, the drummer.)", "title": "The Nature Boys - Non-aggression Pact 31.7.09 Cabaret Voltaire", "publishedDate": "2009-08-05T08:35:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "7JnzRwqa8HQ", "description": "\u015etim c\u0103 ai o mul\u0163ime de prieteni: \u015fi \u00een \u0163ar\u0103, \u015fi peste hotare, mai pe scurt... \u00een toat\u0103 lumea!

White cells that fall within this classification include: neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic and mast cells. \n\nPhagocytes are drawn to infection areas by chemicals that come from either the antigen or other phagocytes already present in the area. The way phagocytes move in response to chemical stimulation is known as chemotaxis. Chemokines are a type of small signaling protein secreted by these cells to activate other nearby white cells. Their function is to direct the movement of cells to the point of invasion. \n\nWhen the phagacyte detects a foreign substance it will bind to it, then begin a process of wrapping around the antigen until it is completely engulfed inside the phagocyte. In doing this the phagocyte creates a membrane around the antigen, which will then allow the phagocyte to inject chemicals into the membrane to essentially kill and break the antigen apart. \n\nOnce the antigen is in broken into pieces, the phagocyte moves a piece to its outside surface. This is known as \"antigen presentation,\" because the antigen is basically being presented to other cells of the immune system to engage them in the process of assisting with the fight. Some phagocytes then travel to the lymph nodes where they present the antigen pieces to lymphocytes that help with building immunity to the antigens.", "title": "Video 11 Antigen Eating Phagocytes", "publishedDate": "2014-01-14T13:57:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "7K-Ba-QXTN4", "description": "Bagi Anda yang memiliki tubuh kurus dan ingin menaikkan berat badan, video ini menjelaskan secara singkat olahraga apa yang harus dilakukan untuk menaikkan berat badan secara sehat dan membuat tubuh lebih berisi.

So the pentatonic scale lends itself really nicely to playing little patterns and taking them up and down. It just really creates a great sound and it's pretty simple to get under your fingers as well. \n\nSo, obviously, with patterns they're endless. We're just going to start with one of the most basic ones, but again it can give you a lot of mileage. Let's use the C major pentatonic scale for this. What the pattern is going to be is just one, two, three, so I'm just going up three notes in a row. \n\nJust to review in the C major pentatonic scale we've got C, D, E, G, A and C back on top again. So if I was just to play one, two, three only on those notes, nice and slowly it would be like this. One, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three and then back up top again, one, two, three. \n\nSo that's how it sounds like slowed down. When you start to speed it up it really can give a nice rolling effect. So now with a little bit more speed we might have... and you could just keep going up and down as far as you'd like with that. Then you maybe want to think about coming down. \n\nSo when you come down you have two choices. You could come down now going three, two, one if you wanted, but let's keep that as its own separate pattern that you're going to practice to get in your fingers. So we're going to keep up that pattern of one, two, three but now we're going to come back down that C major pentatonic scale. \n\nSo now we've got one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, and now again with a little bit more speed we'd have... and then from there you can take your solo wherever you want to go. So they're also really nice because I feel like they're really easy to transition in and out of and whatever kind of line you're doing that's a great thing to just throw in there. So, let's hear what this one sounds like with some music. That's how to solo using a pattern on the pentatonic scale.", "title": "Soloing w/ Patterns on Pentatonic Scale | Keyboard Lessons", "publishedDate": "2013-08-18T21:23:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "7K7dooxtWNw", "description": "Auto-Lifting Toilet Seat,aslo called Self-Raising Toilet Seat,and also named self lifting toilet seat or self moving up toilet seat.This seat, made up of premium ABS, is durable and functional.

When flipped, most of the buoyancy for the platform is provided by water at depths below the influence of surface waves, hence FLIP is a stable platform mostly immune to wave action, like a spar buoy. At the end of a mission, compressed air is pumped into the ballast tanks in the flooded section and the vessel returns to its horizontal position so it can be towed to a new location.The ship is frequently mistaken for a capsized ocean transport ship\n\nFLIP is designed to study wave height, acoustic signals, water temperature and density, and for the collection of meteorological data. Because of the potential interference with the acoustic instruments, FLIP has no engines or other means of propulsion. It must be towed to open water, where it drifts freely or is anchored. In tow, FLIP can reach speeds of 7--10 knots.\nFLIP weighs 700 long tons (711 tonnes) and carries a crew of five, plus up to eleven scientists. It is capable of operating independently during month-long missions without resupply,being able to operate worldwide but the normal area is the west coast of the United States. The vessel operates out of a home base at the Scripps Nimitz Marine Facility in San Diego, California.\n\n\n\n\nHelpful links;\nFamous Ships\nTypes Of Ships\nShips For Sale\nShip Names\nShips Urban Dictionary\nShps\nShip Games\nShips Tumblr\n\n\n\nHelpful hashtags;\n#FamousShips\n#TypesOfShips\n#ShipsForSale\n#ShipNames\n#ShipsUrbanDictionary\n#Shps\n#ShipGames\n#ShipsTumblr", "title": "Foot 700 Ton Ship Flips", "publishedDate": "2014-05-22T10:58:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "7KRKuEyv1vw", "description": "NuBrilliance l'occitane usa l'occitane loreal cremas lociones astringentes Microdermoabrasi\u00f3n piel sana bella tratamiento en el hogar tratamiento piel hermosa privacidad col\u00e1geno callos profesional en est\u00e9tica joven tratamiento seguro exitoso elastina codos rodillas escamoso radiante arrugas resequedad rejuvenecimiento labios est\u00e9tica esteticistas cosmet\u00f3logas cosmetolog\u00eda cirug\u00eda flacidez belleza antiedad anti envejecimiento piel grasa libre de imperfecciones cicatrices acn\u00e9 dermabrasi\u00f3n piel tersa machas cicatrices cicatriz cuidado cuidado de la piel seda limpieza limpio radiante bella moderno tratamiento dermat\u00f3logo dermatolog\u00eda iluminaci\u00f3n vaccum puntas de diamante impurezas barros espinillas c\u00e9lulas muertas exfoliaci\u00f3n sol c\u00e1ncer de piel placidez cara botox mejillas cuello imperfecciones succi\u00f3n epidermis relleno tensa expresi\u00f3n nariz pliegues edad vejez tratamiento pliegues mand\u00edbula ment\u00f3n rodillas fumadores cuello pecho manos solares da\u00f1os solares equipo piel maltratada invasivo cuerpo hiper pigmentaci\u00f3n tez productos para la piel juventud spa sal\u00f3n bienestar Medellin salud NuBrilliance Microdermabrasion healthy skin beauty Home treatment treatment beautiful Skin Privacy collagen callus aesthetic professional young safe treatment successful elastin elbows lap scaly radiant wrinkles dry rejuvenation lips aesthetics beauticians cosmetologists cosmetology surgery flaccidity beauty anti-aging cream skin care products make up remover black  heads oily free of imperfections scars acne dermabrasion smooth skin clams scars scar care skin care silk cleaning clean radiant beauty modern treatment dermatologist dermatology lighting vaccum diamond points impurities mud pimples dead cells exfoliation sun placid skin cancer face botox heeks neck imperfections suction epidermis filling tense expression nose folds age old age treatment folds jawchin lap Smoking neck chest hands solar sun damage team damaged skin invasive body hyperpigmentation complexion skin products youth laser platelets pulsed light plasma anti age make up at home wellness", "title": "Precausiones antes de usar", "publishedDate": "2012-08-19T18:18:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "7KRwvD23mDs", "description": "This is a new set of 64 watch repair tools.

Don't move to throw until you have completely focused (1-2 seconds).\n- Goal: Remind your body by overemphasis that it needs to watch the disc as far into your hands as possible. In reality, the optimum is probably to look the disc almost all of the way into your hands, and it will actually leave your vision for the last foot or two.

CSF sampling in studies with drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease have been conducted with the evaluating biomarkers acetylcholine, tau proteins, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-amyloid fragments. \n\nIn September 2011 QPS performed a validation study in healthy subjects. The purpose of this study was primarily to study the feasibility and especially the safety and the burden for the healthy volunteers of serial CSF sampling within the CRO environment in order to establish a standardized research tool for future drug development studies. \n\nEight (8) healthy male subjects with age between 55 and 75 were included in the study. After assessing eligibility the subjects entered the clinical pharmacology unit 2 days before starting the CSF sampling procedure. Hydration by drip infusion of 2L saline was performed for 24 h before starting the CSF sampling procedure. For antithrombotic purposes Fraxiparine (nadroparine calcium) was given 12 h and 36 h after intradural catheterization. CSF catheterization (Braun Spinocat \u00ae) was performed by a board certified anesthesiologist and CSF sampling by the investigator under aseptic conditions. Subjects could freely move during the sampling period but were required to stay in a horizontally position for at least 24 hours after removal of the catheter. CSF and blood samples were collected from the healthy volunteers by interval sampling over a 30 hour period. Questionnaires for subject experience were performed regularly. ACh was measured. The procedures needed for serial sampling of CSF for 30 h were well tolerated by all healthy volunteers. Bioanalysis of ACh in CSF shows low inter-individual variability. Serial CSF sampling is a sophisticated tool for drug development.\n\nFor more information, contact Edwin van Vulpen, Senior Director Business Development edwin.van.vulpen@qps.com", "title": "cCSF study QPS NL Sep2011 HQ no sound", "publishedDate": "2012-01-26T10:46:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "7L-DCmTC9M8", "description": "Disclaimer: I don't own this video.

Nasanta, daughter to the clan matriarch, is born to the Northern clan. Twaambo, son of a low ranking female, is born to their bitter rivals, the Western clan. Rank in the clan is all important in female-governed hyena society, and cubs take the rank of their mothers. Sex and status cause Twaambo and Nasantas lives unfold along radically different paths, as their clans face competing predators, extreme weather, and deadly inter-clan conflicts.\n\nThe cubs are born at the end of the dry season, when resources are at their lowest, and temperatures at their highest. Its a desperate time for Liuwas hyenas, but relief looms on the horizon: a storm brews. The tempest provides no respite: not a drop of rain falls, but lightning sparks a blaze in the desiccated grasslands! The heat and smoke could kill the cubs, but a fortuitous wind blows the fire off course leaving the dens unharmed. In the wake of the inferno the rains fall at last, paving the way for new life. Wildebeest return to the Plains in their epic annual migration. Cows give birth and calves abound. The time of plenty has begun! The cubs are growing up fast  Nasanta gets her first taste of meat, while Twaambo learns to fight off his bullying clan mates. But as the prey proliferates, a hunt draws Twaambos Western Clan close to the borders of Northern Clan territory. The Nasantas clan detects the intrusion and a vicious clan war breaks out. Fearsome females from the Northern clan corner the Western Clan alpha male and attack him savagely. He must fight for his life!\n\nThe aftermath of the fight reveals the true nature of spotted hyena territoriality  the alpha male has lost his ear, while another male has had his nose and lips ripped from his face. In the wake of the fight, the rains begin anew, and the Plain begins to disappear beneath the rising waters. As dry land dwindles, predators are sandwiched together into common hunting grounds, and conflict erupts. Northern Clan hyenas try to steal the scraps of a wild dog kill, but the tables turn unexpectedly. A hyena is forced to defend his scrap against snapping jaws of the wild dog pack.\n\nDespite the foibles her clan mates, Nasanta is growing into a formidable young cub, dominating over even the clan males despite her small size. Twaambos youth has been a much tougher ordeal  because of his low rank, his clan mates harass him relentlessly. The endless onslaught of abuse drives him to explore ever further from the safety of the den. The flooding is encroaching fast on his den, threatening to cut it off from dry land. The rising waters could be a death sentence for the clan cubs. \n\nThe floodwaters reach the Western Den! Shoulder high waters surround the burrows, but fortunately, they are already empty. The matriarch has led the cubs out already, in search of higher ground. The Western Den is abandoned. Twaambos future is uncertain. \n\nAlmost 2 years later, a stranger appears at the Northern den. Its Twaambo: he has survived the flood, and is now a satellite adult male in search of a mate and a new clan. Nasanta accepts Twaambo as her mate. Unfortunately, another male also favours Nasanta, and tries to force his way into the courtship. Twaambo persists, and Nasanta conceives. Twaambo must now gain the acceptance of his age old rivals, the fierce Northern Clan; while Nasanta must survive her first painful birth, as she brings their first tiny cub into her world on the Liuwa Plains.", "title": "BONECRUSHER QUEENS", "publishedDate": "2009-07-27T18:55:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "7L1ZGjg3PSQ", "description": "Guitarist/Soundscaper Todd Madson rehearses for his midnight show on July 2, 2010 at the Harmonic Convergence stage using a Jackson Soloist SL2 / Roland GK3 pickup / Roland VG-99 / Roland FC-300 / and Electro Harmonix Stereo Memory Man with Hazarai", "title": "Ionosphere Casting Shadows Rehearsal #3 for CVG2010 - Roland VG-99", "publishedDate": "2010-06-30T20:05:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "7L1qqtPPrcs", "description": "Enjoy the video?

Wormwood\n\nMatthew 11:28 \n\"Come unto me, all [ye] that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\" \n\nThe strange and nasty plant called witchweed is found mainly in Africa and Asia, but some has been reported in North America as well. This parasitic plant can prevent crop plants from producing yields and is said to be responsible for intensifying the results of famine in Ethiopia.\n\nNot long after germination, witchweed sends an enzyme \"feeler\" through the soil around it to find nearby roots. If the enzyme finds a root system, it will digest a few of the cells on the root surface. The damaged roots actually help the witchweed by sending out a chemical response that confirms their presence to the witchweed. The witchweed then grows an attachment organ to penetrate the neighbor's root system. However, witchweed cannot penetrate many root systems. If attachment is not made within four days, the witchweed grows aimlessly and dies in less than a week.\n\nIf the witchweed successfully attaches to a neighbor's root system, witchweed can enjoy a long and full life, being fed by its neighbor's roots. In fact, witchweed changes the hormones produced by its neighbor so that the neighbor's root system grows ever larger at the expense of the stem growth of the victim. While the victim may live its normal span, it will not be allowed enough strength to reproduce.\n\nWitchweed is no simple plant. We learn from the witchweed that the Creator's unlimited imagination not only created some very strange living things, but also created some unique solutions to providing a means of living for them.\n\nPrayer: \nDear Father in heaven, I face problems in my life. I commend all of my cares and concerns into Your powerful, inventive and loving care. In Jesus' Name. Amen. \n\nNotes: \n\"The underground sorcery of witchweed.\" Discover, Dec. 1985. p. 14.", "title": "The Witchcraft of Evolution", "publishedDate": "2011-07-07T14:31:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "7L2d4VcXDqI", "description": "CONAN Highlight: Conan is really getting into character to greet the cast of \"The Walking Dead.\"   More CONAN @ http://teamcoco.com/video\n\nTeam Coco is the official YouTube channel of late night host Conan O'Brien, CONAN on TBS & TeamCoco.com.

In 1991, unemployed '60s refugee Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) grooves into his laid-back Los Angeles lifestyle. One of the laziest men in LA, he enjoys hanging with his bowling buddies, pompous security-store owner Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and mild-mannered ex-surfer Donny (Steve Buscemi). However, the Dude's life takes an alternate route the afternoon two goons break into his threadbare Venice, California, bungalow, rough him up, and urinate on his living room rug. Why? Because Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) is owed money by the wife of a certain Jeff Lebowski. However, the goons grabbed the wrong Jeff Lebowski. With the right info, they would have invaded the home of philanthropic Pasadena millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston). The Dude looks up his wealthy namesake, manages to get a replacement for his rug, and meets the millionaire's sexy young wife Bunny (Tara Reid). Later, Jeffrey (\"The Big\") Lebowski calls in the Dude to deliver a $1 million ransom for the return of his kidnapped wife. Fine -- except that Walter intrudes and botches the ransom drop. As events unravel, the Dude gets caught up in the schemes of Lebowski's daughter, erotic artist Maude (Julianne Moore), encounters both cops and bad guys, and drifts through an elaborate bowling fantasy sequence titled Gutterballs. The soundtrack includes Bob Dylan, Yma Sumac, Moondog, Captain Beefheart, and the Sons of the Pioneers.\n\n\"the big lebowski\",\"the big lebowski clip\",\"the big lebowski trailer\",\"the big lebowski part 1\",\"jeff bridges\",\"peter stormare\",flea,\"torsten voges\",\"mike gomez\",\"drugs videos\",\"ferret videos\",\"marijuana videos\",comedy,\"cult comedies\",\"eric fellner\",\"tim bevan\",\"ethan coen\",\"joel coen\",\"john cameron\",\"bathroom videos\",\"jeffrey lebowski - the dude\",\"nihilist 1 uli kunkel\",\"nihilist 2 kieffer\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++158880,/m/0flw6,/m/01wwvt2,/m/0g9m74,/m/012q4n,/m/098j8vd", "title": "The Big Lebowski (8/12) Movie CLIP - Nice Marmot (1998) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T13:24:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "7L38fgnc_e8", "description": "Spot\u0159eba mn\u011b u nov\u00e9ho Superbu FL2014 103Kw diesel velice p\u0159ekvapila.Od prvn\u00edho oto\u010den\u00ed kl\u00ed\u010dku za prvn\u00edch 1300Km \u010din\u00ed 5,3lt/100km a to jsem samoz\u0159ejm\u011b testoval parkovac\u00ed asistent,max rychlost a plno jineho.Navigaci jsem volil Amundsen s kterym jsem spokojen jedin\u00e9 co je nepou\u017eiteln\u00e9 je hlasova komunikace.P\u0159edra\u017een\u00fd Columbus pastva pro zlod\u011bje..ne d\u011bkuji.", "title": "\u0160koda Superb FL2014 spot\u0159eba a ovlad\u00e1n\u00ed Amundsen", "publishedDate": "2013-08-07T19:26:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "7L3cA2K0mM4", "description": "How to correctly assemble your Victorio model 250 food strainer", "title": "Assembling the Victorio model 250 food strainer", "publishedDate": "2010-12-02T17:54:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "7L3pUEQ7nlk", "description": "", "title": "Electrolytic Cells", "publishedDate": "2012-01-20T19:39:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "7L3qV0vXqKg", "description": "With such tight races this November, candidates are focusing on women to get them over the edge.", "title": "Will women save the Democratic Senate?", "publishedDate": "2014-09-21T15:49:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "7L49GbXS8_k", "description": "Note - There are variations of how to perform the SLDL, I recommend slight knee bend allow for hip extension but not enough knee bend for quad activation as in a standard deadlift.\n\nMy Training Program - http://www.canditotraininghq.com/products-services/\nFacebook Page - https://www.facebook.com/CanditoTrainingHq", "title": "3 Quick Tips For The Stiff Legged Deadlift", "publishedDate": "2013-09-04T22:42:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "7L4Fzl4Quzo", "description": "Richard Zelinka shredding The Corby Park (UK).

The trailer focuses heavily on the idea of \"return,\" with the narrator opening the preview by saying, \"Return to a galaxy far, far away,\" and later, \"Return to heroic adventure,\" and \"Return to the ultimate confrontation.\" \n\nThe trailer showcases many scenes out of sequence, focusing on action and the heroes and villains of the film. The opening shot is of Han, Chewie, Luke, C-3PO, Leia, and R2-D2 aboard the stolen Imperial shuttle Tydirium, en route to Endor (\"You ready everybody?\" Han says. \"Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do.\"), then cuts to the Millennium Falcon during the Rebels' assault on the Death Star, shows Jabba and much of the battle on his sail barge, Ewoks battling Stormtroopers on Endor, and the final duel between Luke and Darth Vader in the presence of the Emperor.

Introduction\nOur company produce the SKJ series pellet mill, which absorb elite of Germany KAHL pellet mill. The heart parts \"die\" and \"rollers\" are made by high alloy steel wear resistant material according to different materials, have the longer lifetime. The transmission parts adopt auto differential, drum junctor or universal joint drive. Little noise, low energy consumption, high efficience and easy operation the series pellet mills were developed elaborately to be our patent products. The products are applied to large-sized, medium-sized and small bio-mass energy fuel plant, wood working factory, municipal refuse cleaning plant, organic fertilizer plant, chemical plant, animal feed plant and fishery etc. Low investment, quick efficience, no risk, are the idealest compact shaped equipments. \nThis series pellet mill is with flat die, they are consisted of two rollers, three rollers and four rollers.The small pellet pellet with two rollers, they are generally for home use. Three cone-shaped rollers' pellet machines are our patent product, Patent NO:200720157337.9 they are specially applied to the big project, you can make the pellets from the wood sawdust, straw, some kinds of crop stalk and so on.The technology is developed from Europe,the output volume is high, energy consumption is low and the operation is convenient.\nA) Small pellet machines invest the low cost, and get the quicker profit, they are better for dealing with the life waste, and make the pellets as the fuel at home.\nB) The materials are pressed by the 3 rollers at one time, so the pressed area increases 1 more roller, so the output is improved.\nC) The three rollers are designed taper-shaped and slanted to reduce the friction between the roller and the plate. Therefore the consumption is lower.\nD) The pellet mill with four rollers is our biggest model, it is usually used for the big forest factory and energy technical line.\nII. Advantage of the flat die pellet mill: \n1. Adopts \"taper-shape\" roller (our patent) to make its wire speed consistent to inner and outer die(avoids dislocation friction, save costs, extends lifttime of roller and die), which is the biggest different compared with competitive press machine.\n2.Adopts screw-center pressure adjusting structure to adjust pressure to meet different material demand.\n3. Big body and board groove. Incomparable advantages of enlarging the pressed rollers at will.\n4. Advanced heat treatment, sophisticated production process, fine material we use. Advanced CNC, and famous Huali Brand electric motor in China make our machine stand high among similar machine\nModel  Capacity (kg/h) Power (kw) Product specification(mm) Weight (t) Dimension (mm) Note \nSKJ200 30-80 11-4 \u03a64-6 0.2T 1300x500x850 Be driven with el motor\n or diesel engine\nSKJ250 80-200 15-4 \u03a64-6 0.5T 1400x600x1000 \nSKJ300 100-300 30-4 \u03a64-8  0.76T 1860x670x1600 \nSKJ3-350 300-600 37-4 \u03a64.5-10  2.2T\n  1900x850x1750\n1800x1500x1750 Automatic lubricate syst\nSKJ3-450 500-800 55 \u03a64.5-10 4.3T 2300\u00d71100\u00d71900 \nSKJ3-550 1000-1500 90-6 \u03a64.5-12 5.5T 2350\u00d71000\u00d72050 Automatic pressure adjust; automatic lubricate system \nSKJ3-800 1500-2500 130-160  \u03a64.5-12 6.8T 3200\u00d71235\u00d72700 \nSKJ4-1200 3000-5000 280-320  \u03a64.5-15 19T 3800\u00d71700\u00d74200 \nOur biomass wood pellet mill have efficient centrifugal and flat die two types, this efficient centrifugal is fit for both hard wood and soft wood, straw, stalk, and soft wood material.  \nwe have been in the pellet mill and the complete line for more than 13 years' experience.

Wohin geht der Mensch, wenn er stirbt? Wie sieht die Welt dr\u00fcben aus? Gibt es ein Wiedersehen mit Verwandten und Freunden? Zwei Drittel aller Deutschen glauben an ein Jenseits und an die Reinkarnation. Die meisten Kulturen im asiatischen und arabischen Raum gehen von der Wiedergeburt aus. Nur in der westlichen Welt sind das Sterben, der Tod und das Jenseits noch weitgehende Tabuthemen. Welche Rolle spielen dabei die Kirchen?\nEva Herman befragt den bekannten Nahtodexperten Bernard Jakoby nach den unterschiedlichen Stufen des Sterbeprozesses. Jakoby berichtet, wie der Mensch sich schon zu Lebzeiten am besten auf seinen Tod vorbereiten kann, angstlos, voller Trost und Zuversicht. Denn: der irdische Tod bedeutet ein Weiterleben in der jenseitigen Welt.\nAuch der Hamburger Geisteswissenschaftler J\u00f6rgen Bruhn best\u00e4tigt, dass der irdische Tod nur ein Wechsel zwischen dem Dies- und Jenseits ist. Im Jenseits trifft man seine Liebsten wieder und kann sich weiterentwickeln. Der Theologe und ehemalige Lehrer J\u00f6rgen Bruhn f\u00fchrt erstaunliche Beispiele an.\nDie Wiedergeburt bedeutet Hoffnung f\u00fcr alle Menschen. Sie bedeutet jedoch auch, dass der Mensch sich f\u00fcr sein Handeln und Wirken auf der Erde zur Verantwortung ziehen lassen muss. Bernard Jakoby und J\u00f6rgen Bruhn geben Hilfestellungen f\u00fcr einen rechtzeitigen, verantwortungsvollen Wechsel des Handelns im irdischen Sein. Sie geben auch tiefe Empfehlungen an Trauernde, die ihre sterbenden Verwandten begleiten. Und sie spenden Trost all jenen Menschen, die sich mit dem Tod eines geliebten Menschen nicht abfinden k\u00f6nnen. Denn, so die eindeutige Aussage aller Experten im Gespr\u00e4ch mit Eva Herman: Unsere gestorbenen Verwandten sind nicht fort. Sie sehen und h\u00f6ren uns und sie nehmen weiter an unserem Leben teil. \nPascal Voggenhuber ist das bekannteste und j\u00fcngste Medium im deutschsprachigen Raum. Er lebt in der Schweiz und hat schon vielen verzweifelten Menschen geholfen, Kontakt zu Verstorbenen aufzunehmen: trauernden Eltern, die ihre Kinder auf tragische Weise verloren, Angeh\u00f6rigen und Freunden von Selbstm\u00f6rdern, deren dr\u00e4ngende Fragen niemand vorher beantworten konnte. Er arbeitet auch mit der Schweizer Polizei zusammen. Durch seine Hilfe wurden bereits einige Mord- und Ungl\u00fccksf\u00e4lle aufgekl\u00e4rt. Pascal Voggenhuber nimmt auch zum Tod Uwe Barschels Stellung. Das Medium schlie\u00dft nicht aus, dass der ehemalige CDU-Politiker Barschel im Jenseits keine Ruhe gab, bis sein Fall wieder neu aufgerollt und untersucht wurde. Voggenhuber ist davon \u00fcberzeugt, dass Verstorbene nicht selten aus triftigen Gr\u00fcnden versuchen, Einfluss zu nehmen auf die irdische Welt.", "title": "Das Medium Pascal Voggenhuber \u00fcber Nachrichten von Verstorbenen", "publishedDate": "2011-01-27T14:35:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "7LHWFf2_L6A", "description": "Rey: Frederick, do you see these Lunatic+ badass Risen?

Poland dominated in every element and maintained their lead throughout the set at 13-9 and 19-14 \u2013 pounding on the opponents\u2019 defence. The brightest spot on the Russian side was Ilinykh and his phenomenal services, but Poland quickly found a solution for that as well. In the final stage, the Russians made some run and scored four unanswered points from 22-16 to 22-20, briefly giving Poland a scare. With a bit of help from Muserskiy\u2019s serve at the net, they picked up the set 25-22. \n\nThe second set was the Russians' last chance to stay in contention for the semifinals, so they fought very hard from the beginning. Poland once again were superior over their opponents, especially on the service line and in block. The hosts jumped to an 11-7, but the Russians refused to let them get away too far this time \u2013 with Muserskiy finally back to his good form on the service line that levelled the score at 15-all. Russia were first to reach the second technical timeout. Poland quickly bounced back and regained control at 18-17, forcing Russia coach Andrey Voronkov to call a timeout. The break did not help his team to upset the Polish side. Poland took the set 25-22 that officially secured them their spot in the semifinals. \n\nThe third set was played with a lot less pressure and seemed clouded the Polish players\u2019 minds that allowed Russia to gain advantage 8-3 at the first technical timeout. Poland eventually regained their composure by scoring three unanswered points to cut the lead to within one point at 16-15. Russia proved themselves well and dominated the third set 25-21. \n\nThe fourth set started with an impressive rally during which Poland blocked four times, but eventually the ball went out putting the Russians on the lead. Russia jumped to a five-point lead that left Poland in trouble again. Poland coach Stephane Antiga made some substitutions and his team finally scored a series of points to trail Russia 13-11. Michal Kubiak led the phenomenal run of Poland with two spikes and a block, which tied the score at 16-all. The play continued point-by-point for some time, but Muserskiy showed his best skills to make an unstoppable run in the fourth set 25-22, to force tiebreaker. \n\nThe final set brought some fresh energy for the Polish team, who regained focus and quickly jumped ahead to a 4-1 lead. Poland increased their advantage to five points 8-3 and kept the advantage throughout the set. Both teams exchanged a series of points, but Poland had better rhythm and lesser errors that allowed them to close the set and match 15-11.", "title": "Sets, Poland vs  Russia (3-2) - Volleyball Men\u2019s World Championship 18.9.2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-18T23:08:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "7LofeaLwqls", "description": "Visit www.freemedigital.com for more on digital music distribution\n*\n\nThis is the debut album of Waje titled W.A.J.E meaning Words Aren't Just Enough.

W. Awdry, and the American TV series Shining Time Station. The film was co-produced by Gullane Entertainment (a wholly owned subsidiary of Mattel) and the Isle of Man Film Commission and distributed by Destination Films (a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment). It was written, produced and directed by Britt Allcroft.\nWhen it was first released in the U.K. where critics were unfamiliar with the characters from Shining Time Station, the film was accused of \"Americanizing\" Thomas. Critical reception in the U.S. was somewhat better, but still mostly negative, in stark contrast to the praise given to the original Shining Time Station, which was an award-winning show. Since the film's release, various specials based on Thomas & Friends have been released, although they are not directly related to this film.

Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals,while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi. Fertilization is the fusion of both sex cell or gamete.Copulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for insemination and subsequent internal fertilization. Mating may also lead to external fertilization, as seen in amphibians, fishes and plants. For the majority of species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. However, for some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not required because the parent organism is capable of self-fertilization (autogamy); for example, banana slugs.\nFor animals, mating strategies include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of mating and artificially inseminating domesticated animals is part of animal husbandry.", "title": "Cabras Culeadoras Goats mating", "publishedDate": "2014-09-01T06:59:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Lw256PdJ9k", "description": "June 15, 2013\nMilwaukee, WI\nAnonymous Choir - \"Don't Let it Bring you Down\" (Neil Young) \n\nAnonymous Choir is an ensemble of women from Minneapolis.

Samuel Inkoom (Dnipro) vs Karapty\nWednesday, November 2nd, 2011\n The law about booking players for taking off their shirts is perhaps one of the most contentious rules in the modern game.\n As most will be well aware, Fifa for several years have insisted that -- regardless of circumstances -- shirt removal is an automatic yellow card offence.\n This has brought about a series of silly bookings throughout the years. One recent example from last season saw Tamir Cohen collect a yellow after scoring a 90th minute winner for Bolton against Arsenal for taking his shirt off to reveal a picture of his late father.\n\nEncouragingly in England Doncaster striker Billy Sharp avoided a booking on Tuesday night when he removed his shirt after scoring a goal just days after his two-day-old son had died. However this remains the exception, rather than the rule.\n\nWith that in mind we bring you action from the Ukrainian top flight from the start of the week.\n\nDnipro won 2-nil away at Karpaty on Monday night, but not everything went the visitors way as their Ghanaian international Samuel Inkoom received a crazy red card.\n\nJust after the hour the substitutes board was held up, instructing Inkoom to come off the pitch for teammate Evgeniy Shakhov. But before Inkoom managed to haul himself into an early bath, the player managed to get himself sent off.\n\nAs he ran towards the sidelines to exit the pitch, Inkoom removed his Dinpro top. That shirt removal was spotted by the yes-man referee, who in turn flashed the midfielder his second yellow of the game.\n\n\u0421\u0430\u043c\u0443\u044d\u043b\u044c \u0418\u043d\u043a\u0443\u043c (\u00ab\u0414\u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u00bb). \u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0443\u043c\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u0442\u0435\u043c, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043e\u043a \u0433\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430. \"\u0413\u043b\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\" \u0438\u043b\u0438, \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e, \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f \u0442\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u043d \"Fail \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\". \u0412 \u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c, \u043a\u0430\u043a \"\u041a\u0443\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0437 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\". \u041d\u0430 62-\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0418\u043d\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0428\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432. \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0440 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0443, \u0433\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u0447\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e, \u0441\u043d\u044f\u043b \u0441 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b \u043a \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f. \u0410 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043d\u0430\u043b \u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433 \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u044a\u044f\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443 \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0442\u0443\u044e \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0443, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0432 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0435, \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0443\u044e. \u0412 \u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0435 \u00ab\u0414\u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u00bb \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b, \u0438 \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f...", "title": "Substitution FAIL!

It is grounded by the transmission computer at the other terminal.\n2) The shift solenoid resistance range is from 20 to 40 Ohms, but do check the vehicle specs.\n3) Use a ceramic 10 Ohms resistor in series with a head light to test the solenoid. \n4) Shift solenoids tend to fail after they're hot. \n5) To check, apply 12 volt power at one end, and ground the other wire using the resistor headlight tester. Do this for about a minute. If headlight is dim, then solenoids resistance is too high, so replace it. \n6) Afterwards, momentarily ground the solenoid on and off, and listen for a clicking noise. \n\nYou may also do this procedure, with the engine running in park, to flush out dirt from the solenoid. You may ground the solenoid inside the car, at the transmission connector. This test is also good for duty cycle controlled solenoids.

Blood sugar is measured in a sample of blood taken from a vein or from a small finger stick sample of blood. It can be measured in a laboratory either alone or with other blood tests, or it can be measured using a handheld glucometer, a small device that allows frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels without the need for a doctor's office or laboratory.\n\nHyperglycemia is a hallmark sign of both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.\n\nWhat causes hyperglycemia?\n\nA number of medical conditions can cause hyperglycemia, but the most common by far is diabetes mellitus. Diabetes affects over 8% of the total U.S. population. In diabetes, blood glucose levels rise either because there is an insufficient amount of insulin in the body or the body cannot use insulin well. Normally, the pancreas releases insulin after a meal so that the cells of the body can utilize glucose for fuel. This keeps blood glucose levels in the normal range.\n\nWhite Mulberry is known as the food for the Modern Life. It is mainly used as a dietary fiber that helps maintain blood sugar levels and the heart system. White mulberry leaf extract controls high blood sugar levels naturally by slowing the breakdown of sugars in the intestines causing them to be absorbed into the blood more slowly.

With these tips, anyone can keep a houseplant alive \u2013 even you!\n\n\nStep 1: \nPick a plant that's tough to kill. Hardy varieties include spider, rubber, and snake plants, and pothos, aloe vera, and peace lilies. \n\nStep 2: \nChoose a good location. Plants do best in the light and temperature of their native environment. For instance, tropical plants like their surroundings bright and humid, while cacti need sunlight but very little water.\n\nTip\nPut houseplants that thrive on humidity in the bathroom \u2013 the dampest room in the house. \n\nStep 3: \nFind out your plant's foot-candle requirement, which is how many candles it would take to light the plant from one foot away. A plant that needs 250 or fewer candles is a low-light plant; one that needs more than 1,000 requires very bright light. If your plant didn't come with this information, search for it online. \n\nStep 4: \nPoke the soil with your finger before watering. If it's moist, leave it alone. Overwatering is the no. 1 killer of houseplants. \n\nStep 5: \nFertilize a few times between the spring and fall. Low-light plants only require fertilization once or twice a year. Slow-growing plants need less fertilizer, while faster growing varieties need more. Choose a fertilizer that contains nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Water the soil before fertilizing to prevent fertilizer burn. \n\nTip\nWatering your plants with the water in which you boiled vegetables or water from your fish tank gives them nutrients that help them grow. \n\nStep 6: \nTalk or sing to your plants. Some research has indicated this can help them thrive, as does playing certain kinds of music. Indian sitar music works best, followed by classical music. Stay away from heavy metal: Plants exposed to loud rock music died after a few weeks in one famous experiment. \n\nDid You Know?\nBritish media famously lampooned Prince Charles in 1986 after he said in a T.V. interview that it was very important to talk to plants, and that they respond to the human voice.", "title": "How to Keep an Indoor Plant Alive", "publishedDate": "2009-10-02T13:01:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Me0txXmMI0", "description": "", "title": "Sewing the sleeve onto the bodice", "publishedDate": "2013-04-05T02:17:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Me3Ohq_NaY", "description": "Little tricks to butching a jackfruit.", "title": "How to cut up a jackfruit", "publishedDate": "2010-08-29T15:32:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Me4mn_x9Qo", "description": "\u00a1Decora tus u\u00f1as con Nanny by Nosotras!

I've actually written 6 books and I'm hard at work on my next one. It will be about about dogs -- that's as much as I can say right now. I love dogs and I think nobody's life is complete without one. So I'm here to tell you about a variety of different dogs breeds that might suit your lifestyle. I hope you'll adopt one soon. The Rottweiler is an amazing dog. And actually, if you want to be really technical, because it is a German breed, the W is pronounced as a V, like victory. So it's Rott-Veiler. There is actually a statue in Rotweill, Germany of a Rottweiler, a beautiful dog. These dogs were originally used as working dogs, and they still are used as working dogs. But this is a great example of a dog whose job has evolved to meet, you know, and match what humans need. In the old days, the Rottweiler was actually used as a drover. They actually drove cattle and other livestocks for the people who were butchering them. They also accompanied butchers to market. And the money was often tied around their neck, because, who's gonna mess with a Rottweiler? But, in reality, they're actually very cuddly, wonderful dogs. The Rottweiler now works in search and rescue...they do therapy work. They are service dogs also, because they're very strong. They pull things. You know, they're just amazing all around, strong working dogs, and they like to have a job. Similar to a pitbull, a Rottweiler really does need a strong hand, a strong but gentle hand in training. That's very important for a dog like a Rottweiler, so that he or she doesn't become aggressive. So I've gotten to know many of them, I love this breed. They make wonderful dogs, and I think they're beautiful. Just the black glossy coat with the brown marking. They often have little eyebrows. And sometimes when you see mutts with eyebrows, it's pretty easy to figure out that there's some Rottweiler in the lineage.", "title": "Pros & Cons of a Rottweiler | Dog Breeds", "publishedDate": "2011-05-11T20:09:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "7MgzWUprqhU", "description": "At KIMBERLY-CLARK PROFESSIONAL*, we are committed to building a sustainable future.

The species has been successfully introduced to many parts of the world for shooting, including vast areas of North America, where it is most commonly known as Hungarian partridge, or just \"Hun\". Widespread and common throughout its large range, the Grey Partridge is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This partridge breeds on farmland across most of Europe into western Asia, and has been introduced widely into North America. They are quite common in some areas of southern Canada and the northern United States.\n\nThe Grey Partridge is a rotund bird, 28--32 cm long, brown-backed, with grey flanks and chest. The belly is white, usually marked with a large chestnut-brown horse-shoe mark in males, and also in many females. Hens lay up to twenty eggs in a ground nest. The nest is usually in the margin of a cereal field, most commonly Winter wheat. The only major and constant difference between the sexes is the so-called cross of Lorraine on the tertiary coverts of females -- these being marked with two transverse bars, as opposed to the one in males. These are present after around 16 weeks of age when the birds have moulted into adult plumage. Young Grey Partridges are mostly yellow-brown and lack the distinctive face and underpart markings. The song is a harsh kieerr-ik, and when disturbed, like most of the gamebirds, it flies a short distance on rounded wings, often calling rick rick rick as it rises. They are a seed-eating species, but the young in particular take insects as an essential protein supply. During the first 10 days of life, the young can only digest insects. The parents lead their chicks to the edges of cereal fields, where they can forage for insects. They are also a non-migratory terrestrial species, and form flocks outside the breeding season.\n\nSource : Wikipedia \n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

There are two different ways to counter the kicking attacks. Alright? The first one and most common on is once I've blocked a roundhouse kick with my leg, I come down and then I return back with a kick of my own. Okay? So I'm going to defend my opponent's left roundhouse kick. Okay? I block and then from the block I come down and then come straight up with my own roundhouse. One more time. I block, come down, up, and then up with my own roundhouse kick. \n\nNow, when I block with the left one, also come with a block. I'm not going to put the leg down in front and then switch because now it takes a little bit too much time to go through the motions. So after I block from this position here now, I'm going to shoot forward with the right foot and then go right into the kick from there. Okay? So, I'm going to block the right roundhouse kick. I block, and then up from there. Again. Block, and then up from there. Okay? \n\nNow, the other one. If my opponent decides to throw his left roundhouse kick, if I don't have the time to block with the right leg, I can come up and I can use a front push kick or a teep (?) in order to put him off of balance now. So he comes up with that left roundhouse kick, I drop the left teep (?), puts him off of balance, now I can close the distance and now go into attack now. Again. \n\nWhen you come up with that push kick, make sure you pick your knee up nice and high so when you go out, your foot ends up pretty much in the middle of the chest so you can get good movement out of your opponent. Okay? So again, he comes up with that left roundhouse. I go up and then now I can come in. When he attacks with his right roundhouse, I'm going to come up with my right leg (okay?) in the same motion again. Up. Again, up. And then extend the leg out and again now I can attack in with punches or kicks. Alright.\n\nNow we have my opponent throws a kick up high. I may not be able to block the kick with my leg, so I'm going to take the impact. Once I've taken the impact, I come right back down and I throw my kick towards the thigh. So when you speed it up and you go up, bop, bap. Again. He comes up, bop, bap. Alright? And that is defending some of the attacking kicks.", "title": "5 Tactics to Counter Kicking Attacks | Muay Thai", "publishedDate": "2012-05-26T23:30:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "7MouseqEAxM", "description": "If you are excited about this new card, then be sure to drop a like rating!\n\nI hope you enjoyed this video.

Just click the following link...\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Coloring-Book-Merry-Pages/dp/1493711334\n\nfrom IRONPOWER Publishing\n\n\nThis book is designed to capture the spirit of Christmas. There are over 100 pages which contain 50+ delightful, black-and-white line illustrations for coloring, that have been created to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ over two thousand years ago. You'll find all your favorite images embodying the essence of Christmas, from Baby Jesus, Mary, and the Three Wise Men in the Nativity, through to Santa Claus, Christmas trees, stockings, gifts, reindeers and sleighs...plus much more! The images are very easy to color, with lots of open spaces. They are detailed enough to keep young minds occupied, without being so challenging they lose interest. The images are printed on one side of the pages only, to give the best coloring experience. The pictures are accompanied with explanatory text, written into rhymes to tell the stories and deliver the messages. The first half comprises of an A-Z Christmas alphabet, with big bold letters to color. The second half contains a story of the Old Lady who lives in a shoe, and how both she and Santa cope with delivering toys to all her forty-two children! This book is designed to capture the imaginations and attention of growing minds, to give them hours upon hours of coloring fun! I hope they enjoy it as much as we enjoyed creating it. \n\n\nWHY THIS IS SUCH A GREAT GIFT IDEA... A fantastic stocking stuffer/Christmas gift for children ages 4 to 12. A wonderful holiday gift for young artists of all ages. Each page is a high bright white paper that children can use colored pencils, textas, crayons, magic markers, or water colors on. This Christmas coloring book provides over 100 pages of fun filled coloring activities. But it's more than just a Christmas coloring/activity book, there's fun and entertainment in the text too. Here's a sample... When Santa dropped in With his pack full of toys -- One for the girls and One for the boys. His eyebrows shot up at The long line of socks, But he started right in And opened a box. He pulled out a wagon, He pulled out a bike, A rocking horse toy and Two scooters alike. He pulled out doll strollers And trunks of dolls clothes. Put some in these stockings And some into those. It was a long time Before he was done- There were forty-two socks And he didn't miss one! Watch your child's eyes light up when he first sees the great picture of Santa on the cover. \n\n\nRelevant keywords:\nchristmas coloring pages\nchristmas colouring pages\nchristmas coloring pages for kids\nmerry christmas coloring pages\n\u00a0merry christmas coloring\ncoloring pages of christmas\nchristmas ornament coloring pages\nchristmas ornaments coloring pages\nchristmas coloring book\ncoloring book christmas\nchristmas coloring book pages\nhard christmas coloring pages\neasy christmas coloring pages\nfun christmas coloring pages\nfunny christmas coloring pages\nsimple christmas coloring pages\nchildren's christmas coloring pages\ncartoon christmas coloring pages\njesus christmas coloring pages\nchristmas coloring pages jesus\ndifficult christmas coloring pages\nkids christmas coloring pages\nchristian christmas coloring pages\ncute christmas coloring pages\nreligious christmas coloring pages\nchristmas coloring pages free\nnativity coloring pages\nchristmas coloring sheets\nsanta coloring pages\nchristmas tree coloring pages\nxmas coloring pages\nxmas coloring\nkids christmas coloring pages\ncoloring christmas pages\nchristmas stocking coloring pages\nchristmas card coloring pages\nchristmas cards coloring pages\nchristmas mandala coloring pages\nchristmas wreath coloring pages\nchristmas themed coloring pages\nchristmas coloring pages for preschoolers\nchildrens christmas coloring pages\nchristmas coloring book pictures\njesus coloring pages\nreligious coloring pages\ncoloring pages for kids\nkids coloring pages\nkids colouring pages\ncoloring pages for girls\ncoloring pages for kids\nkids coloring pages\nkids coloring sheets\ncoloring pages for boys\ncute coloring pages\nprecious moments coloring pages\ncartoon coloring pages\ngirl coloring pages\npreschool coloring pages\nholiday coloring pages\nfun coloring pages\npreschool coloring pages\nnumber coloring pages\nkids coloring games\neducational coloring pages\n\n\nBook Available NOW at Amazon.com.

I am still in recovery from Cushing's disease from a adrenal gland tumor. I have Adrenal insufficiency since my adrenalactomy and still on hormone replacement. I still continued to improve after the last video I made and want to share with you guys the progress. As you can see my whole face changed eversince the adrenalectomy and thank goodness the acne and moon face went away. I am starting to look more feminine now that the steroids are not as much in my body. I have lost a bit too much weight from lack of appetite but I am not complaining!
