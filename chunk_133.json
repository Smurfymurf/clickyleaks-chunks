Since becoming an independent nation, Togo has struggled to become a unified country. In 2005, following the death of their president, the military appointed his son as the next leader, which led to violent protests and 40,000 people fleeing the country. The nation has one political party (Rally of the Togolese People) and is also a military-civilian regime, which gives civilians control of the military.\n\nMany diseases plague the Togolese people, including HIV/AIDS and Malaria, which is the leading cause of death in the nation. There are also some ethnic tensions between the people in the north and the south. Women are legally considered equal, but culturally they are still inferior and are discriminated against in the workplace and government programs. The society is extremely patrilineal. Agriculture is the largest economic sector and employs 65% of the workforce. The average daily income in Togo is under $1.25.  \n\nThis French-speaking nation was anti-Christian in the 1970s but has since become more ambivalent, giving its people religious freedom.  Christianity has grown significantly since the 1990s, and Christ is now claimed by 30% of the population. The rest follow traditional African beliefs (50%) and Islam (20%). Unity within the Church and syncretism have become huge issues for believers as ancestor worship and other African rituals have made their way into Christian services. There is a great need for the younger generation to be reached, with over 300,000 orphaned and unwanted children exploited in the sex trade and child labor. Others are being manipulated with the promise of work and converting to Islam. Pray that the Church will be able to break away from the traditional beliefs, such as ancestor worship, and that the Togolese believers will continue to grow in their faith.", "title": "Prayercast | Togo", "publishedDate": "2012-10-03T22:59:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "7NNBQJm18fI", "description": "Subscribe to Escapist Magazine! http://bit.ly/Sub2Escapist\n\nThis week on Zero Punctuation, Yahtzee gaily shreds Guitar Hero III.\n\nFast-talking Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw reviews a new game each week in this animated series that combines informed critique with cutting humor.

Handy to know this if you want a sperm-scented garden. Other sperm-scented plants that spring to mind are:\n\n\u2665 Carob blossom\n\n\u2665 Photinea serrata blossom\n\n\u2665 Chestnut blossom\n\n\u2665 Fritillaries--the bulbous flowers like asphodels\n\n\u2665 Ladslove--or Lad's Love ;)  (The crushed leaves release the semen odour.)\n\nBerberis thunbergii 'Atropurpurea' are tough, drought-resistant shrubs, and have dark reddish purple leaves. They are rather thorny and good places for small birds to abide in safety. They put on a very colourful autumn leaf display, too.\n\nWikipedia lists the acidic berries as edible.

She developed a string of catch-phrases such as 'She knows, you know', \"You big girl's blouse' and 'Be soon', and she became a master of the malapropism and double entendre -- such as \"I can say that without fear of contraception\" and \"You haven't had the pleasure of me yet\".\n \n    \nIn 1955 she made a very successful appearance on TV's 'The Good Old Days' and this took her on to greater heights, including a couple of serious film parts in 1960. In both 'Saturday Night and Sunday Morning' and 'Up The Junction', Hylda Baker played a back-street abortionist.\n\nShe had previously starred in an early BBC sitcom called 'Be Soon' but this had not been particularly successful. She put the record straight in 1968 when the TV series 'Nearest and Dearest' became a huge hit, running for seven series until 1973. Hylda's character Nellie Pledge, owner of a Pickled Onion factory, was ideally suited to her talents and she was cast opposite the skilled comedian Jimmy Jewel. At the age of 73 she made her final TV appearance - on BBC TV's 'Top of the Pops' -- duetting (in black leather gear and blonde wig) with another oldie, Cockney comedian Arthur Mullard. Their 1978 send-up of Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta's hit from Grease, 'You're The One That I Want', was a great success (reaching number 22 in the UK singles charts).

Urinary stones are typically classified by their location in the kidney (nephrolithiasis), ureter (ureterolithiasis), or bladder (cystolithiasis), or by their chemical composition (calcium-containing, struvite, uric acid, or other compounds). About 80% of those with kidney stones are men.\nLa lithiase urinaire ou urolithiase (parfois lithiase r\u00e9nale ou n\u00e9phrolithiase) est une maladie caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par la formation de calculs (du latin : calculus, caillou), accr\u00e9tions (cristallines) solides de min\u00e9raux dissous (de la whewellite) dans l'urine et qui se forment dans les reins ou les uret\u00e8res. La taille des calculs varie d'un grain de sable \u00e0 celle d'une balle de golf. Les plus gros, dits \u00ab coraliformes \u00bb, moulent l'int\u00e9rieur du rein, ayant ainsi l'aspect de branches de corail. Les calculs sont typiquement \u00e9vacu\u00e9s par le jet de l'urine ; s'ils grandissent jusqu'\u00e0 une taille relativement importante avant de passer (de l'ordre de quelques millim\u00e8tres), l'obstruction d'un uret\u00e8re et la distension des cavit\u00e9s r\u00e9nales par l'urine peut provoquer des violentes douleurs (dites \u00ab coliques n\u00e9phr\u00e9tiques \u00bb), si\u00e9geant en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au flanc et dans le bas abdomen.", "title": "\u0633\u0639\u064a\u062f \u062d\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0646 - \u0627\u0632\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u062d\u0635\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u064a", "publishedDate": "2014-08-12T20:30:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "7N_ySEWArCI", "description": "Il s'agit de 'Abd Allah, le fils de Sheikh 'Abd Ar-Rahman As-Sudais, r\u00e9citant une partie de la sourate F\u00e2tir (35).\n\nComme l'on dit : \u00ab La pomme ne tombe jamais loin de l'arbre. \u00bb\n__________________\n\n29.

If the water inlet valve sticks open, it will allow water to fill the dishwasher continuously. Some customers report that they see clean water filling the bottom of the dishwasher after it's been sitting all night or for a couple of days. If this happens, turn off the water that is supplying the dishwasher. This is normally a valve under the kitchen sink. Then, replace the water inlet valve, it cannot be repaired. The water valve needs at least 20 lbs pressure to shut off properly. If your water pressure is to low replacing the valve may not solve the problem.\n\nThe dishwasher has an electrical water valve called a water inlet valve. If the dishwasher won't fill with water, the water inlet valve might be defective. These valves are not repairable and will have to be replaced.\n\nEvery day, tens of thousands of people use our advanced, easy-to-navigate, comprehensive troubleshooting and repair help system on our website- http://www.repairclinic.com/RepairHelp?TSLID=1807 -- for troubleshooting by symptom, finding recommended replacement parts and learning how to successfully fix their appliances, outdoor power equipment and heating and cooling equipment on their own. Please have your product's model number handy and head there for help diagnosing your dishwasher.\n\nIf you're unable to find the information you need on our website, we suggest that you use a search online to find a reliable online repair forum. It's likely that your question has already been answered there.

Without a starter it can take anywhere from 1 week up to 4 weeks because of variables like temperature, freshness of produce etc.  Check every few days and put something under container that will catch overflow if fermentation is vigorous.  When bubbling stops taste test it.  It should be sour and not salty.  If it's good then put it in the fridge.  I've found when done correctly you can store in the fridge or root cellar for 6 months no problem and up to 12 months is possible. It tastes better as it ages.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Our modern diet and chemical exposure has led us all to have very unhealthy levels of beneficial bacteria in our body.  It is all through our digestive system from mouth to lower intestine.  It aids in assimilating nutrients we eat during digestion.  This bacteria also helps remove heavy metals and other harmful pathogens from causing all kinds of imbalance to our nervous system, immune system and all other systems of the body in various ways.  In other words it is VERY IMPORTANT to reestablish the healthy bacteria and get rid of the pathogenic bacteria from flourishing.  Look into the GAPS diet and see how many physical and mental illnesses have been cured when gluten and casein have been removed from the diet and fermented veggies have been added to the daily diet of many people.  Your doctor isn't trained to tell you this.  Please don't waste your time with store bought probiotics.  They are crap.  Store bought products are expensive and have at most up to 14 strains of  bacteria if that.  They are also in very low doses.  Homemade fermented foods such as this have 100 or more different strains that develop from the natural yeasts in the air.  The AMA is not to be trusted.  The FDA is not to be trusted.

Each pollen grain is a male haploid gametophyte, adapted to being transported to the female gametophyte, where it can effect fertilization by producing the male gamete (or gametes), in the process of double fertilization).\n\nA successful angiosperm pollen grain (gametophyte) containing the male gametes gets transported to the stigma, where it germinates and its pollen tube grows down the style to the ovary. Its two gametes travel down the tube to where the gametophyte(s) containing the female gametes are held within the carpel. One nucleus fuses with the polar bodies to produce the endosperm tissues, and the other with the ovule to produce the embryo. Hence the term: \"double fertilization\".\n\nIn gymnosperms the ovule is not contained in a carpel, but exposed on the surface of a dedicated support organ such as the scale of a cone, so that the penetration of carpel tissue is unnecessary. Details of the process vary according to the division of gymnosperms in question.\n\nThe receptive part of the carpel is called a stigma in the flowers of angiosperms. The receptive part of the gymnosperm ovule is called the micropyle. Pollination is a necessary step in the reproduction of flowering plants, resulting in the production of offspring that are genetically diverse.", "title": "Pollination Botanical garden Greifswald", "publishedDate": "2014-04-26T06:38:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "7NxHY7iTJOc", "description": "This is an actual class conducted by Ms. Hazel Lasala with her student, Mr. Masashi Fujita.", "title": "[AliseoFlex Actual Class] English Conversation", "publishedDate": "2010-04-24T08:05:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "7NxgPzsJlYw", "description": "Movie: Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000)\nSong: Kuch To Bata \nSingers: Abhijeet and  Alka Yagnik\nMusic: Jatin - Lalit\nCast: Shahrukh Khan and Juhi Chawla\nJames Zanuck\n______\nLYRICS\n______\nkuchh toh bata are kuchh toh bata, na na na na na\nphone ka number ghar ka pata, na na na na na\n\nkuchh toh bata are kuchh toh bata, na na na na na na na na\nphone ka number ghar ka pata, na na na na na na na na\ntere liye hal hai yeh, dekh mujhe tu yu na sata\nkuchh toh bata are kuchh toh bata, na na na na na na na na\nhaan phone ka number ghar ka pata, na na na na na na na na\n\nkehna hai jo kaho jaldi jaldi, varna yu hee raho main toh chaldi\naise karo nahee hi bye, aao piye kahin chai bai\nsamjao kitni bar yeh koshishe bekaar, samjo mujhko hai inkar\ndil meh pyar hai albatta, na na na na na na na na\nkuchh toh bata are kuchh toh bata, na na na na na na na na na na\ntere liye hal hai yeh dekh mujhe tu yu na sata\nkuchh toh bata are kuchh toh bata, na na na na na na na na\n\ndil ka kahoge jo kissa bissa, aayega mujhko toh gussa gussa\njaane de gusse ke chakar vakar, aa chalke dekhenge picture viture\nkarte ho kyun yeh shor dekha karo na bore, yeh dil mange na anymore\nkoi toh milne ka rasta, na na na na na na na na\nare kuchh toh bata are kuchh toh bata, na na na na na na na na\ntere liye hal hai yeh, dekh mujhe tu yu na sata\nha kuchh toh bata are kuchh toh bata, na na na na na na na na\nphone ka number ghar ka pata, na na na na na na na na\nhey hey hey hey la la la, ha ha ha ha la la la", "title": "[HD] Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani - Kuch To Bata  | Shahrukh Khan | Juhi Chawla |", "publishedDate": "2012-09-15T14:51:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Nxqxuk0Qh0", "description": "While in the middle of recording a show, we hear a woman scream like she is being murdered in the night.", "title": "Blood Curdling Scream during S&M radio", "publishedDate": "2013-07-19T21:26:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "7NxzH21yaXk", "description": "The Spur-winged Lapwing or Spur-winged Plover (Vanellus spinosus) is a lapwing species, one of a group of largish waders in the family Charadriidae.\n\nIt breeds around the eastern Mediterranean, and in a wide band from sub-Saharan west Africa to Arabia. The Greek and Turkish breeders are migratory, but other populations are resident.\n\nThese are conspicuous and unmistakable birds. They are medium-large waders with black crown, chest, foreneck stripe and tail. The face, the rest of the neck and belly are white and the wings and back are light brown. The bill and legs are black. Its striking appearance is supplemented by its noisy nature, with a loud did-he-do-it call.\n\nThe bird got its name because of a spur (a small claw) hidden in each of its wings.\n\nThis species has a preference for marshes and similar freshwater wetland habitats. The food of the Spur-winged Lapwing is insects and other invertebrates, which are picked from the ground. The famed \"Crocodile Bird\" is sometimes taken to be this species, but it is actually the true plover Pluvianus aegyptius.\n\nIt lays two blotchy yellowish eggs on a ground scrape. The Spur-winged Lapwing is known to sometimes use the wing-claws in an attack on animals and, rarely, people, who get too close to the birds' exposed offspring.\n\nThis species is declining in its northern range, but is abundant in much of tropical Africa, being seen at almost any wetland habitat in its range. The Spur-winged Plover is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

However, extended periods of rest between workouts can diminish your physical fitness progress over time. This means that when you don't workout consistently, your body implements physiological reactions which cause you to loose the gains you had made. \n\nFor example: Your strength diminishes, you become less aerobically fit, your flexibility decreases, etc. \n\nThis can happen in a relatively short time after you stop training, which can be frustrating. \n\nThe most important thing for you to do is to get yourself back moving. \n\nSome tips for overcoming reversibility:\n\nAfter an extended rest from exercise, start back off slowly.\n\nResume your training with greater volume as opposed to higher intensity\n\nFocus on improving your flexibility & avoid maximum attempts with your weight lifting. These points are particularly vital to keep yourself injury-free. \n\nTry to have active rest, for example playing light sport, going for easy walks, doing gardening etc. Its great to have a break from your rigorous exercise routine, but be sure to keep your body moving in some way.\n\nJoin Drew on Google+ : https://plus.google.com/u/0/106220222668811625406\nSubscribe at http://www.youtube.com/MyWellfitTrainer\nJoin us on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/WellfitPersonalTraining\nNewsletter subscribe : http://www.wellfitpersonaltraining.com.au/personal-training-blog/", "title": "The Principle of Reversibility & Tips to Overcome It | Day #9 WellFit 365", "publishedDate": "2013-01-08T20:16:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "7O0Dx3tSg4c", "description": "well, this is weird. big description incoming hah\n\nSorry for being so shitty and inactive, I really have nothing else to say other than I'm really busy now. I don't know if anyone really cares now, I mean I still keep up with YouTube to some extent and wow, a few people have really gotten amazing. I've been around YouTube for longer than most people would think, and I've had many aliases, channels, styles, motives, etc. From console to PC, etc. And I can see I'm really dying down now. It's kinda sad, as I've put a lot of time into it, but the spark of YouTube just isn't there anymore. And the people who I once knew who were genuinely good people aren't there anymore either. I can just see myself dying down. This probably isn't going to be my last edit, as whenever I have time to do it and whenever I have motivation I do love editing. So stick with me if you want, there's probably more stuff coming, I just never will know when. \n\nSome may have seen this on another channel, because one day I had a LOT of motivation and pumped out this exact edit in around 6 hours. I started a new channel not because I wanted a new, secret alias, I just wanted a fresh audience. But I know now there's no point to that, so I'm uploading it here.

I want all Ukrainians, especially in the south-east, Crimea, Sevastopol, to know that they are not alone, that they will never be left in distress, that nobody will ever allow any violence, not a single hair to drop from a head of any resident of Sevastopol or Crimean peninsula,\" said the leader of the Russian nationalist Liberal Democratic party.\n\n\"Moscow will not allow any violence with respect to the Russians in any part of Ukraine,\" he added.\n\nHe also promised to support any aid request coming from the the south-east regions of Ukraine.\n\n\"We will support any request from Crimea, Sevastopol and the south-east. Russia will provide any amount of money. We will give any amount of gas and oil needed so no-one will get cold in the south-east of Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nMoscow has promised to defend the interests of its citizens in Ukraine and has said it will not intervene by force. But its rhetoric since the removal of Yanukovich a week ago has echoed the run-up to its invasion of Georgia in 2008.\n\nArmed men took control of two airports in the Crimea region on Friday in what the new Ukrainian leadership described as an invasion by Moscow's forces, and ousted President Viktor Yanukovich surfaced in Russia after a week on the run.\n\nMore than 10 Russian military helicopters flew into Ukrainian airspace over Crimea, Kiev's border guard service said, accusing Russian servicemen of blockading one of its units in the port city of Sevastopol, where part of Moscow's Black Sea fleet is based.\n\nA serviceman at the scene confirmed to Reuters he was from the Black Sea Fleet and said they were there to stop the kind of protests that ousted Yanukovich in Kiev.\n\nThe fleet denied its forces were involved in seizing the military airport near Sevastopol, where armed men later occupied the runway, Interfax news agency said, while a supporter described the armed group at the civilian international airport in Simferopol as Crimean militiamen.\n\nAny armed confrontation in Crimea would have major global repercussions, with Russia and the West already at odds over the change of power in Ukraine and supporting opposite sides in Syria's civil war. They have, however, pledged to cooperate to prop up Ukraine's faltering economy.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntd.tv\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "Russian Nationalist Zhirinovsky Cheered by Crowds in Sevastopol", "publishedDate": "2014-03-01T08:59:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "7O8Q0eTf0pk", "description": "This work is done by Dima, CG enthusiast from Russia.

Trapped in a day-long Saturday detention in a prison-like school library are Claire, the princess (Molly Ringwald); Andrew, the jock (Emilio Estevez); John, the criminal (Judd Nelson); Brian, the brain (Anthony Michael Hall); and Allison, the basket case (Ally Sheedy). These five strangers begin the day with nothing in common, each bound to his/her place in the high school caste system. Yet the students bond together when faced with the villainous principal (Paul Gleason), and they realize that they have more in common than they may think, including a contempt for adult society. \"When you grow up, your heart dies,\" Allison proclaims in one of the film's many scenes of soul-searching, and, judging from the adults depicted in the film, the teen audience may very well agree. Released in a decade overflowing with derivative teen films, The Breakfast Club has developed an almost cult-like status.\n\n\"the breakfast club\",\"the breakfast club clip\",\"the breakfast club part 1\",\"the breakfast club part 5\",\"anthony michael hall\",\"emilio estevez\",\"ally sheedy\",\"molly ringwald\",\"judd nelson\",\"paul gleason\",\"dark humor black comedies\",drama,\"john hughes\",\"ned tanen\",\"andrew meyer\",\"gil friesen\",\"michelle manning\",\"ethics videos\",\"friendship videos\",\"loyalty videos\",\"preparation videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++6997,/m/01z7s_,/m/0281lp,/m/01jvs4,/m/022769,/m/01wq0_s,/m/02f8lw", "title": "The Breakfast Club (7/8) Movie CLIP - Covering for Bender (1985) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T13:38:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "7OFbswALuRo", "description": "Podemos ver en este video como corregir este error que no te permite hacer descargas", "title": "En android, Corregir error com.google.process.gapps", "publishedDate": "2013-07-15T07:06:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "7OFuh-MR0_E", "description": "http://www.effectuation-intelligence.nl\n\nThanks to Prof.dr.

It was written in 1844 and published with some changes in 1848. Four years after it was written, Slovenes living within Habsburg Empire interpreted the poem in spirit of the 1848 March Revolution as political promotion of the idea of a united Slovenia. In it, the poet also declares his belief in a free-thinking Slovene and Slavic political awareness.

These government agencies; executive, police, attorney general, courts, commissions, tribunals, boards, etc have powers bestowed upon them. There is risk that these agencies may abuse their power, or takes actions in excess of the powers conferred upon them by the law.  The administrative law is considered one of the major branches of public law. \n\nThe courts in the United States and elsewhere in the world have handled many matters of administrative law. In practice, this law is reinforced by the courts issuing certain orders, writs, and rulings.  In instances where it is found that a public body exceeded or abused the powers conferred upon it then that action can be declared ultra vires. \n\nCertiorari is one of the writs commonly issued in administrative law. This writ is mostly issued by higher court to lower court requesting the lower court to produce its record in particular case so that the higher court can review it.  The United States Supreme Court mostly uses certiorari in picking cases it is empowered by law to review. This writ is mostly issued in cases whereby there is no right of appeal. \n\nMandamus is an order commonly issued in administrative law cases. It is in the form of court order to individual, corporation, public body, or governmental official ordering and requiring that government official to correct abuse of exercise of powers conferred upon them, or to fill the duties conferred upon them by the law. For example, if a student feels that he or she was unfairly denied admission to certain college or school, he or she can go to court and request the court to issue mandamus.  After the hearing, the court may issue the writ of mandamus to that college or shoal requiring it to admit the student whom it had denied admission.\n\nProhibition order is the opposite of mandamus. In administrative law, prohibition order acts as legal restriction preventing permanently or temporarily a public body, organization or authority from doing something or continuing with some certain conduct. In practice, the prohibition order is used so as to prevent certain body or organization from taking certain prospective decision. For example, it may be used to tribunal or lower court restraining it from doing something that exceeds the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the law. \n\nQuo warranto is a common procedure in administrative law. It Latin, the term quo warranto means 'by what authority?' The procedure is taken so as to stop organization or person from continuing with an action or activity in which it does not have legal authority under the law. The person going to the court quo warranto wants to know the right by which that organization or person exercises the controversial authority. \n\nMany jurisdictions in the world have 'replaced' the orders or certiorari, mandamus, prohibition and quo warranto with injunctions, judicial review and other generic-named remedies in administrative law. However, the grounds, spirit and procedure of these new generic tools remains same as that of traditional remedies.", "title": "Administrative Law", "publishedDate": "2013-07-02T18:09:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ONSIeZLaTM", "description": "The Kitchen Witch demonstrates how to make the ultimate twice baked potato with cheese, bacon, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, and green onion!\nVisit the recipe here: http://www.lyndsaythekitchenwitch.com/2010/09/the-ultimate-twice-baked-potato.html\nVisit The Kitchen Witch on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/XXGWxL\nVisit The Kitchen Witch on Twitter: https://twitter.com/LyndsayWells\nVisit The Kitchen Witch on Pinterest: http://pinterest.com/KitchenWitchery/", "title": "The Ultimate Twice Baked Potato", "publishedDate": "2013-06-14T16:19:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ONfj5kkX9g", "description": "another practice of my telekinesis abilities, as you can see I am  no close of my pyramides, so this is not static electricity or wind, but my probleme is that I cant control the way my pyramides turns", "title": "TELEKINESIE TEST", "publishedDate": "2009-10-22T15:02:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "7OO-Q3JhUq4", "description": "Watch the Deer Tick FULL CONCERT playlist: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gKsCAokPZk&feature=share&list=SP4h2XGENb6qhxGLj8DyP9NW9VFX1Es9cQ\nDeer Tick performing Something To Brag About   live at Webster Hall in New York on 20 November 2011\n\nLove live music?

For many century Hmong was ruling China but due so many wars the Chinese people took over all land and called it China.  The Hmong not only lost the war but all their written language, land,.  To survive all Hmong people spread across Asia.  Some went to India, North Vietnam, Burma, Thailand, Laos.Even though the Hmong people have no written history anywhere; stories were told mouth to mouth and cockfighting was one of them.  How the Hmong people fought their chicken was very interesting. Their cock was called \"qaib dib\" pronounced \"khai de\" and they took them to the forest for hunting with them.  They would use their cock to chant and call the wild rooster.  Once the wild rooster would come it would fight with the domestic cock.  Sometimes it will fight until death, but most of the time the Hmong man would use their bow to kill the wild rooster.  It has been said that many other groups of people have come to the Hmong and asked their chicken to be bred. One of the fairy tail is that a Hmong man has offered his best rooster to the King of Thai with the color of yellow with white tail, the one that the Thai people called today \"leung hang qhaou\" which is the King's chicken.  The Hmong chicken was very good fighting with their spurs and deadly kick.  That's how they were able to fight the wild rooster.\nFor the Hmong who have left China most of them became nomad.  They became known as the montagnards or \"highland people\".  Watching a rooster fight has always been fascinating for all Hmong young boys.  For some of them who were too young to adventure into the forest and fight the rooster with the wild one, they would take their father rooster and go to the next village and try to fight the rooster with another one if they ever found one wondering in the garden or on the street.  They would throw the rooster to the other one and watched them fight until one gave up or until both of them could not fight anymore. \n          Because the Hmong have lost their written language so there was no documents reporting Hmong as chickens fighters; but other stories such as the Hmong lords used to fight their rooster in dispute for their land instead of fighting wars with each other.  The Hmong believe that a rooster can kill the other rooster in one kick.  If asked what style or what kind of rooster they do like, most of their answer would be the one who can kill in one kick.  The Hmong adore their chickens and take care of them very carefully.\nIn the late 1960's in Laos more and more Hmong were involved with the city so they were more exposed to the real game of cock fighting.  New to this field of game but so fascinated by, the Hmong became very active and developed their own breed, participate and compete with the Lao and Thai.  However the Thai chickens remain the best of all time but the Hmong quickly imported Thai breed and they have become one of the toughest opponents for the other entire breed.\n          Now for the Hmong who live in the United States they are the most active in cockfighting compare to all other ethnic group coming from Asia.  However they do not like cockfighting with knives, needles or other weapons. They feel that it's too cruel and there are no art or skill in that at all.  They love their chicken and they hate to see their rooster be beaten or kick all the times.  If they see their rooster get hurt too much they would stopped the fight and surrender even though the rooster came from a very good blood line and would not give up or collapse.  Today they are having activities all across America with all new breeds especially crossbreed.", "title": "Thai Rooster Shamo Aseel Fight 2", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T02:32:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "7OQ0KDvEQ8Q", "description": "Meus canais: \nCanal Realidade Americana http://www.youtube.com/realidadeamericana \nCanal Carlinhos Troll TV http://www.youtube.com/CarlinhosTrollTV\n\nTodas novidades saem primeiro nesses canais abaixo: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/CarlinhosTroll \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/CarlinhosTrollei \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/CarlinhosTrollOficial \nFanPage http://www.facebook.com/RealidadeAmericana \nGrupo Realidade Americana no FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/realidadeamericana/\n\nSite Realidade Americana http://realidadeamericana.com\n\nQuer comprar produtos diretamente comigo nos Estados Unidos? http://realidadeamericana.com/orcamento/\n\nAbra\u00e7\u00e3o", "title": "M\u00e1quina de copiar chaves - Self Service", "publishedDate": "2013-06-19T21:54:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "7OQTYWdELm0", "description": "This insect crawling on the pathway.\nAt Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.", "title": "SAM_3068 [Insect 1].MP4", "publishedDate": "2010-09-19T08:22:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "7OQUBXVtCQw", "description": "The Turkey support for ISIS continues as thousands of ISIS gangs have crossed the Turkey border into ISIS areas on september 14th, just before the renewed heavy attacks on Kobane. \nWhile in Antep, Turkey, a hospital was build for the treatment of ISIS members.", "title": "Turkey Support For ISIS Continues", "publishedDate": "2014-09-27T14:22:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "7OQWvdULdwg", "description": "I absolutely *LOVE* the skill on enemies.

What's the difference between the different angles and which position is the strongest.\n\nJust the other day I received this bench press question on facebook:\n\n\"Hello Lee, I have a question.\nFor training chest, is incline bench press or flat bench press more difficult? Should we be using the same weight for both exercises? Or is one heavier than the other?\"\n\nThe incline bench press works more of the upper pecs, around the collar bone area. It also works more of the shoulders compared to the flat or decline bench variations. There is a greater range of motion when pressing in an incline and you will not be as strong with the incline bench as you will with the flat bench press.\n\nThe flat bench press works the overall chest. This is by far the most popular bench press variation. It is the \"original bench press\" exercise and one of the 3 powerlifts. If you've been working out for any length of time than I'm sure you've been asked \"How much can ya bench?\" at some point or another :-) You'll be stronger with the flat bench press compared to the incline bench press.\n\nAnd finally we have the decline bench press. This move is not as popular as the flat and incline bench press and you won't see as many people doing it in the gym. But it's still a great exercise non the less. The decline bench press will work more of the lower chest and triceps without placing as much strain on the shoulders. The decline bench is the strongest of all bench press variations. You'll be stronger with the decline bench press compared to the flat bench press.\n\nMost People Are Going To Be:\n- Weakest on Incline.\n- Stronger on Flat.\n- Strongest on Decline.\n\nIf you would like some more tips about bench pressing, make sure to check out my blog post: \"How To Bench Press More Weight With Proper Technique\" \n\nhttp://leehayward.com/blog/how-to-bench-press-more-weight-with-proper-technique", "title": "Incline Bench vs. Flat Bench vs. Decline Bench", "publishedDate": "2014-01-31T00:05:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "7OQk9WjufXw", "description": "This video is about How To Download A Video From Youtube To Your Computer Without Using Any Softwares For Free 2014\n\nHere is the link : https://binbox.io/YP1lX#l51bTdhw\n\nHey gyus SomeOne Professional here with a tutorial on \" How to download a video from youtube \" so in this short video i am going to be showing you gyus \" How to download any video from youtube.com without using any aditional softwares \" so let's begin.\n\nSo let's pick a nice video and to do so i will just go to my channel and pick one of mines. so let's choose this one \" How to download / activate kaspersky antivirus \" and then pause the video and copy the URL of the video and then go to this website https://binbox.io/YP1lX#l51bTdhw.  so let's enter the link of the video you want to download and click download you have to choose one of the options and i recommand you choose MP4 ... so as you can see my download is ready and i begin to download my video so i will just wait a few seconds to show you my video .\n\nSo that was a very simple and easy way to download any video you want from youtube.com without using any softwares, so let's repeat this againto download any video from youtube just follow this 5 simple steps :\n1.

They were the closest of the seven and were barely seperated. Nonetheless, deep down Arista felt she would never be as perfect and beautiful as her sister, no-one ever saw her or loved her when she was alongside Ariel. When Ariel met Eric, Arista's fears were reinforced tenfold. Ariel left Arista for the human life, for the human man and Arista was hurt. She felt lonely without her sister and grew more and more isolated, longing for someone to love her. \n\nWhen Ursula took over the Kingdom, Arista was caught under her spell, bound as her siren. The spell accentuated her resentment towards Ariel and her hatred for the men who took her away from her, this made her a deadly killer. Ursula noticed this and Arista soon became her special favourite. To reward her, she offered her the ability to walk on land, to draw more men to the temptations of the sea. Arista gladly accepted.

A maximum output of 265 kW (360 hp) and up to 450 Newton meters of torque are unmatched by any other mass-produced turbocharged four-cylinder engine worldwide. The power density of 133 kW (181 hp) is also absolutely unrivalled. In this discipline, the new AMG high-performance turbo engine even outstrips the most powerful super sports cars.\n\nThe AMG sports exhaust system features large pipe cross-sections and an automatically controlled exhaust flap. This technology, which is familiar from the SLK 55 AMG, reconciles the two apparently conflicting aims of tangible dynamism and hallmark Mercedes comfort on long journeys. The flap is continuously adjusted by map control according to the power called up by the driver, load status and engine speed. The two striking tailpipes of the AMG sports exhaust system emit a fascinating, full engine sound which is particularly impressive during powerful acceleration.\n\nAn AMG Performance exhaust system with exhaust flap and featuring a dedicated tailpipe trim design is optionally available for the A 45 AMG. This provides for an even more emotional and striking engine sound when the throttle is open and during gear shifting. The double-declutching function during downshifting and the interruption of ignition and injection during upshifting under full load produce a particularly throaty sound with the AMG Performance exhaust system and create a level of emotionality which is otherwise the reserve of engines with more than 4 cylinders.\n\nvia: mercedes-amg.com\ncamera: JVC Everio GZ-HM300\nthanks to: Automobile Theo Denker GmbH, Bocholt (Germany)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat do you think of this little bomb?

Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is a well-meaning but not especially bright fellow with a gift for making the worst of any situation. Bean is about to be fired from his job as a guard at the Royal Nation Art Gallery for sleeping on the job, but the Chairman (John Mills) intervenes at the last moment. To insure that his incompetence will manifest itself so completely that there will be no choice but to get rid of him, Bean's superiors come up with a plan -- they'll send him to America to speak at a posh private gallery owned by George Grierson (Harris Yulin), where General Newton (Burt Reynolds) will display the most recent addition to his art collection, \"Whistler's Mother.\" It's even money whether or not the museum will still be standing before Bean is done; as if this weren't enough, while in L.A. Bean is mistaken for a surgeon and forced to operate on an injured police officer. Richard Curtis, one of the film's producers, said after viewing the final product, \"It's an unpleasant family movie.

There are few details regarding the circumstances of her death; however, her mother confirmed it on Facebook, saying the moment before her passing away, her daughter had had the family laughing. \n\nHer 3 minute video was removed from YouTube; however, by that point her school friends at Louisville Male High School had already shared it, according to Louisville Courier-Journal. Before it was taken down, Jefferson County Public Schools blocked Twitter, and YouTube access all through the district so as to protect students. \n\nA statement from the district said that it was an attempt to ensure students who are impacted emotionally could receive the help needed as they work with other officials to deal with the situation through the most efficient and appropriate channels. Twenty grief counselors were provided to Male High School, for students to meet and talk to. \n\nHer school friends have as well been sharing tributes online. The school tweeted 'Male High's thoughts and prayers go to the Yates' family.

Iamblichus, for example, records that an Egyptian priest named Bitys was supposed to have translated some of the hieroglyphic texts of Thoth into Greek, and had made use of (Greek) philosophical vocabulary in doing so.[110] These texts Bitys had found 'in temples at Sais in Egypt', which of course is where Solon was supposed to have encountered Egyptian priests more learned in the history of Greece than any Greek, and to have translated parts of their archives.[111] Iamblichus also tells us that Pythagoras and Plato, during their visits to Egypt, 'read through' the stelae of Hermes with the help of native priests.[112] Whether these stories are true is not important for this discussion. What is important is first, that the Hermetists wished it to be believed that their compositions were books of Thoth rendered from Egyptian into Greek; and secondly that the legitimacy and prestige of these books depended on the finding of a plausible explanation of how this translation had been brought about. Hence the last twist in the evolution of the myth of the Egyptian Hermes, namely the presentation of none other than Hermes the younger as the translator of the Thoth texts. At any rate, this appears to be the idea underlying the obscure and corrupt pseudo-Manetho passage already mentioned. After referring to the hieroglyphic texts inscribed by Thoth, the first Hermes, pseudo-Manetho goes on to assert that 'after the Flood they were translated from the sacred language into Greek, and deposited in books in the sanctuaries of Egyptian temples by the second Hermes, the son of Agathos Daimon and father of Tat.[113] That the Thoth-literature was believed to have been rendered into Greek at such an early date has struck modern scholars as so improbable that they have emended the passage.[114] However, Plato had spoken of the translation of Greek records into Egyptian after the deluge(s); and anyway this was exactly the sort of claim that Hermetists had to make if they were to overcome the well-known inadequacies of translations from Egyptian into Greek.", "title": "Iamblichus & The Souce Of Plato's Knowledge", "publishedDate": "2014-09-23T06:10:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "7PYRVUXCwEo", "description": "", "title": "05 06 2014 CHIEFTAINCY MINISTER VISITS OKYENHENE", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T07:24:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "7PYSzJR38a8", "description": "No Copyright Infringement Intended.", "title": "Serving Sara Trailer [HD]", "publishedDate": "2010-12-31T16:45:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "7PYX7hiou_k", "description": "***HEADPHONE USERS BEWARE***\n\nLeave a like if you enjoyed! :)\n\nCONNECT WITH ME!\n\nTwitch - http://www.twitch.tv/jevffa\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/FaZeJev\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/mrjeverson#\n\nCheck out TGN!\nhttp://tgn.tv/", "title": "OUTTA NO WHERE!

Currently, Hyderabad is the common capital of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states, an arrangement that is scheduled to last for a maximum of ten years. Occupying 650 square kilometres (250 sq mi), along the banks of the Musi River, it has a population of about 6.8 million and a metropolitan population of about 7.75 million, making it the fourth most populous city and sixth most populous urban agglomeration in India. At an average altitude of 542 metres (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including Hussain Sagar\u2014predating the city's founding\u2014north of the city centre.\n\nEstablished in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Hyderabad remained under the rule of the Qutb Shahi dynasty for nearly a century before the Mughals captured the region. In 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, also known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. The Hyderabad State ultimately became a princely state during British rule, and remained so for 150 years, with the city serving as its capital. The city continued as capital of a new Hyderabad State after the Nizam acceded to the Indian Union in 1948. In 1956, it became the capital of Andhra Pradesh, formed by merging Telangana region of Hyderabad State with the Telugu-speaking Andhra State. In June 2014, after Telangana state was carved out of Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad became part of Telangana state and the joint capital of both states.\n\nRelics of Qutb Shahi and Nizam rule remain visible today, with the Charminar\u2014commissioned by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah himself\u2014coming to symbolise Hyderabad.Golconda fort is also a major landmark of Hyderabad. That legacy is also evident in the city's distinctive cuisine, which includes Hyderabadi biriyani and Hyderabadi haleem. The Qutb Shahis and Nizams established Hyderabad as a cultural hub, attracting men of letters from different parts of the world. Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire in the mid-19th century, with artists migrating to the city from the rest of the Indian subcontinent. While Hyderabad is losing its cultural pre-eminence, it is today, due to the Telugu film industry, the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures.\n\nHyderabad was historically known as a pearl and diamond trading centre, and it continues to be known as the City of Pearls. Many of the city's traditional bazaars, including Laad Bazaar, Begum Bazaar and Sultan Bazaar, have remained open for centuries. However, industrialisation throughout the 20th century has also attracted major Indian manufacturing, research and financial institutions, including the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, National Geophysical Research Institute and the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology. Special economic zones dedicated to information technology have encouraged companies from across India and around the world to set up operations and the emergence of pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in the 1990s led to the title of Genome Valley. With an output of US$74 billion, Hyderabad is the fifth-largest contributor to India's overall gross domestic product.\n\nSource :- Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

We present an approach to printing the reflectance functions of an object or scene so that its appearance is modified correctly as a function of the lighting conditions when viewing the print. For example, such a .photograph. of a statue printed with our approach appears to cast shadows to the right when the .photograph. is illuminated from the left. Viewing the same print with lighting from the right will cause the statue.s shadows to be cast to the left. Beyond shadows, all effects due to the lighting variation, such as Lambertian shading, specularity, and inter-reflection can be reproduced. We achieve this ability by geometrically and photometrically controlling specular highlights on the surface of the print. For a particular viewpoint, arbitrary reflectance functions can be built up at each pixel by controlling only the specular highlights and avoiding significant diffuse reflections.

She first developed anhidrosis in the late summer of 2007 (an extremely hot, humid summer) when she was nursing her foal, Tempo.  Puck continued to suffer from anhidrosis for the next three summers.  I treated her with One AC, dark beer, flaxseed and everything else anyone recommended to me, with little success.  Summers were torture for this mare, but we hosed her with cold water 4-6 times per day and did our best to keep her out of the sun, retired her from work, etc. In August of 2011 I started all my horses on a simple diet of CoolStance, HorseTech's High Point for Grass Vit/Min supplement and grass hay/pasutre.  Within just a few weeks, Puck started sweating again!  She sweated normally during the summer of 2012 with no additional supplements and this video is proof that she is still free from the suffering of anhidrosis! Don't ever let anyone tell you that proper nutrition, including the elimination of sugars, starches and toxins from the diet, won't help with anhidrosis.  Puck is living proof that it works!!

Located at the west end of Scotlands Central Belt on the banks of the River Clyde, Glasgows historical importance as Scotlands main industrial centre has been challenged by decades of change and various regeneration efforts. Today the third largest city in the entire United Kingdom by population, it remains one of the nations key economic centres outside London.\nIn recent years, Glasgow has been awarded the European titles of City of Culture (1990), City of Architecture and Design (1999) and Capital of Sport (2003). In 2008, Glasgow became the 2nd Scottish city to join the UNESCO Creative Cities initiative when it was named as a UNESCO City of Music. In preparing its bid, Glasgow counted an average of 130 music events a week ranging from pop and rock to Celtic music and opera. The city has transformed itself from being the once mighty industrial powerhouse of Britain to a centre for commerce, tourism, and culture.\nGlasgow will be the host city for the Commonwealth Games from 23 July to 3 August 2014, see Glasgow 2014 for details. Accommodation will be considerably more expensive during this period, so these dates may be best avoided if you are not going to the games.\nGlasgow has become one of the most visited cities in the British Isles, and visitors will find a revitalised city centre, the best shopping outside London without a doubt, excellent parks and museums (most of which are free), and easy access to the Scottish Highlands and Islands.\n\nEnjoy Your Glasgow Tours!", "title": "Glasgow Tours", "publishedDate": "2014-08-16T07:37:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Q46FykQLYE", "description": "Wi\u0119cej na: http://famelab.org.pl\n\u00a9 \u0179r\u00f3d\u0142o: [http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipa], (83.19.118.20)\n[http://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pipa&action=history],\nlicencja: [CC-BY-SA 3.0 Deed (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)", "title": "CeZik - Pipa (\u015apiewaj\u0105ca Wiki zaprasza na FameLab)", "publishedDate": "2011-12-13T09:29:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Q4O0Cq_y38", "description": "From plant to harvest, these heirloom white icicle radish took forty days.", "title": "Harvesting White Icicle Radish", "publishedDate": "2014-03-24T18:58:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Q4froV7IRI", "description": "Megan Albany & Marc Mittag of Skinful get their funk on at The One World Musical evening.", "title": "Skinful \"Make the Time\"", "publishedDate": "2007-05-15T10:11:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Q4rM4nkt10", "description": "shoes sole cleaner and shoes bottom washer, see more at http://www.shoes-sole-cleaner.com/", "title": "shoes sole cleaner for home office and small workroom", "publishedDate": "2013-08-16T12:32:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Q4wmbC-oH8", "description": "Do you have what it takes to be a pet person?", "title": "Nathan Fielder (On Your Side) - Being A Responsible Pet Owner", "publishedDate": "2008-07-23T00:24:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Q5ApASQLXc", "description": "Visit http://autolinepreowned.com for more info on this2006 Nissan Pathfinder S from Autoline!\n Woody from Autoline Take you on a comical yet informative tour of this 2006 Nissan Pathfinder S  that we just put on the lot to show you what the other fake automated \"Johnny Five\" voice over walk around's don't... aka the good stuff that we all really care about.

Although she miraculously survived, Joy's back was broken, and she was told she would most likely never walk again. Watch Joy explain what got her through her recovery.

You work to get a Nazi pig hanged.\" - Allen Barker, NPT Theorem \n\n\"Organized Stalking is a form of terrorism used against an individual in a malicious attempt to reduce the quality of a person's life so they will: have a nervous break-down, become incarcerated, institutionalized, experience constant mental, emotional, or physical pain, become homeless, and/or commit suicide. This is done using well-orchestrated accusations, lies, rumors, bogus investigations, setups, framings, intimidation, overt or covert threats, vandalism, thefts, sabotage, torture, humiliation, emotional terror and general harassment. It is a \"ganging up\" by members of the community who follow an organizer and participate in a systematic \"terrorizing\" of an individual.\" -- Mark M.

Things are going along really well. Now is the time when you brush some great barbeque sauce on it and really finish these up. \n      \nSo they've been in foil for about an hour and a half at this point. We're going to open them up and I think one of the things you'll see is the beautiful color that you get on the ribs. I'm going to flip these over. But you can see, just that great amber color. Everything looks really juicy. You can see that they're starting to get some movement on the bones. We've still got some cooking time to go, and that's what this part is. \n      \nSo I'm going to brush on some sauce. We like to give it a good coat. A lot of people like to use sweet sauce. We do on ribs. We think it just is a right compliment, particularly if you have a rub that has a little bit of heat to it. And remember part of the reason that we're doing this process is to make sure that you have some complexity to the ribs that you're cooking. So sauce at the end makes a huge difference. I'm going to hit this side with the sauce. You don't need as much on the bone side, but you need just enough to make sure that you have especially messy ribs, which is what everybody likes at the end of the day. \n      \nSo we're coated up. Now what we do is we take them out of the foil. Put them back on, bone side down. We're going to go about 15 more minutes. Probably put another coat on in another 10 to 15 minutes. We'll check for doneness. Pull them out and we'll be ready to have award winning barbecue ribs for your friends and family. \n      \nWe've got our final product. We just pulled the ribs off the smoker. They've been sauced. Now it's time for cutting and eating. This is what the final product looks like. You can see that it has a fantastic color. It's got a lot of different layers of coloring and flavor, which are just going to  really wow your friends and family. \n      \nNow the secret to cutting ribs, as you might think, you have to put them down this way and cut them. The problem is, is that it's hard to see where the bones are and so it makes it difficult to cut. So, our secret, flip it over this way. Let's you really be able to see the direction of the ribs and it makes it a lot easier to cut. \n      \nAnother tip is, this is a pretty large slab of ribs, but you can actually hold them with your fingers and it gives you a good direction to cut. \n      \nNow we use a grout blade, but you're welcome to use any kind of big knife. It will work fine. You cut in the direction of the bones. You'd like to cut as close to the bone that you can and that way you get as much meat as possible on the ribs. Cut a few here. They end up serving really well. Nothing looks more impressive to your friends and family when you stack up a tray full of ribs. We'll show you how you can stack them here. This, you can see, we've got a nice smoke ring on the ribs. That came from the first two hours before we foiled it, and then really at the end of the day's about the flavor. \n      \nAward winning ribs, my friends. You can cook them at home.

Rife discovered that viruses, bacteria, sick and healthy body tissue react to certain tones. In his laboratory he observed with a high performance microscope that diseases dissolve under selective sound radiation and body tissue gets healthier. The human body is approximately 73% water and the tones have positive effects on the information memory of this water molecules. This slight changing of the elements of life works similar to homeopathy as coding of the energy field of a person.\nWhat's special about the NRT is the use of the laboratory sounds of Dr. Rife as musical-harmonic titles. The video version contains additional color resonances, based on the latest findings of the light - and color research. Excited feedback of many people from around the world show the effectiveness of this method.\n\nApplication\nTry the free video samples and get the high-quality original titles on CD/DVD. You can use headphones or regular sound speakers. Good sound speakers may also increase the effect of the method. The sounds of the Nordwest Resonance Technique (NRT) may contain very low and very high tones, use moderate loudness.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nDie Nordwest Resonanz Technik (NRT) unterst\u00fctzt mit energetischen Klangschwingungen die Gesundheit.\nDer medizinische Forscher Dr. Royal R. Rife entdeckte, dass Viren, Bakterien, krankes und auch gesundes K\u00f6rpergewebe auf bestimmte T\u00f6ne reagieren. In seinem Labor beobachtete er mit einem Hochleistungsmikroskop, dass sich Krankheiten bei gezielter Klangbestrahlung aufl\u00f6sen und K\u00f6rpergewebe ges\u00fcnder wird. Der menschliche K\u00f6rper besteht ungef\u00e4hr zu 73 % aus Wasser und die Klangschwingungen wirken positiv auf den Informationsspeicher der Wassermolek\u00fcle. Diese geringe Ver\u00e4nderung der Bausteine des Lebens funktioniert \u00e4hnlich wie Hom\u00f6opathie, als Codierung des Energiefeldes einer Person.\nDas Besondere an der Nordwest Resonanz Technik ist die Verwendung der Laborkl\u00e4nge von Dr. Rife als musikalisch-harmonische Titel.

With most young adults deserting the city, Bangor stood on the verge of becoming a ghost town. However, there has been a resurgence of activity in the area lately.\n \nBangor is a mining town located in the southernmost fringe of Antrim Mountains. It is most distinguished by the red soil and towering cliffs.\n\nSince of a layer of sea wind from the east which is forced over the mountain ranges, Foehn wind is created. This makes for an extremely arid climate and a very high average annual maximum temperature. Rainfall is also short due to its geographical position.\n\nThe iron-rich red soil, high in acidity, has prevented any development of agriculture in the region. Natural resources, however, are plentiful and mining is a dominant industry in Bangor. While a past invasion of Fomors once threatened Bangor's only means of supporting its infrastructure, a movement towards reconstruction of the town's former glory has been noted.\n\nThe aftermath of the invasion has forced most of Bangor's young population to move out to the mains, and outsiders now maintain the otherwise faltering mining industry.\n\nA path leading to Morva Aisle exists, and for this reason there is a lot of foot traffic.\n\nA well provides the town's only source of drinking water, as no streams or rivers run past Bangor. Refinement of metals is done using groundwater from a local watermill.\n\nMusic: A Dreaming Village", "title": "Mabinogi BGM - Bangor", "publishedDate": "2013-03-23T19:50:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "7QXatMnUrzY", "description": "", "title": "PSBC Guatemala 2013 - Brian Bates - Hari Kari", "publishedDate": "2013-07-29T03:07:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "7QY9-n_-80A", "description": "Trojanettes", "title": "Saginaw high trojanettes", "publishedDate": "2012-10-27T17:01:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "7QYFHwp4wI0", "description": "Trying for a \"ringer\" (strike) at the Highland Social (ninepins) Club, San Antonio, TX", "title": "Me trying ninepins", "publishedDate": "2013-05-31T06:49:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "7QZbGgH1L48", "description": "http://StephaniesAnimalRescue.org In Lake City, MI (near Cadillac and Traverse City) specializes in rescuing the bully breeds.

Etwa ein Dutzend von ihnen ist in Europa heimisch. Die Sternkiefern wachsen wild \u00fcberwiegend in den k\u00fcstennahen Bereichen des Mittelmeers. Sternkiefern sind sehr licht- und w\u00e4rmebed\u00fcrftig. An den Boden stellen diese B\u00e4ume jedoch kaum Anspr\u00fcche. Vielerorts wurden Sternkiefern angepflanzt, wie etwa in S\u00fcdostfrankreich, um das Wandern der D\u00fcnen aufzuhalten. Sternkiefernw\u00e4lder nutzt man heute zur Terpentin\u00f6l-Gewinnung. Das Terpentin ist im Harz der Sternkiefer enthalten. Durch Einschnitte in das Holz der Kiefernst\u00e4mme wird das Harz zum Auslaufen gebracht. Mit den frischen oder getrockneten Knospen der Sternkiefern , die wie die der Waldkiefern in der Naturheilkunde verwendet werden, lassen sich Aufg\u00fcsse, Hustenbonbons und Sirup zubereiten.  Als Badezusatz wirken Anwendungen mit den Sternkiefern entspannend.\n\nDie Sternkiefer ist einh\u00e4usiger, bis zu 40 m hochwachsender Baum. Der Stamm w\u00e4chst gerade und schlank. Sternkiefern bilden eine ausladende, lockere Krone. Die Borke der Zweige ist braunrot. Die starren, bis zu 20 cm langen Nadeln wachsen zu zweit. Sie sind basal in einer h\u00e4utigen Scheide eingeschlossen. Die Bl\u00fctezeit der Sternkiefern erstreckt sich von April bis in den Mai. Die Zapfen wachsen in kleinen sternf\u00f6rmig angeordneten Gruppen. Ein Zapfen ist 10 bis 20 cm lang und gl\u00e4nzend braun. Der Geruch der Sternkiefern ist intensiv aromatisch. Der Geschmack ist aromatisch und bitter.\nStandort / Hier findet man die Sternkiefern\n\nDie Sternkiefer w\u00e4chst an den Mittelmeer- und Atlantikk\u00fcsten. Man findet die Sternkiefern bis in H\u00f6henlagen von 1600 m.\nWirkung der Heilpflanze / Heilwirkung - Sternkiefer\n\nanregend, antiseptisch, f\u00f6rdert den Auswurf, balsamisch, harntreibend, hautreizend\nIn der Naturheilkunde verwendete Pflanzenteile\n\nIn der Naturheilkunde benutzt man von den Sternkiefern die Nadeln, die Knospen, den Saft und das Holz.\nAnwendung mit der Heilkraft dieser Pflanze\n\nWichtige Inhaltsstoffe dieser Heilpflanze sind: \u00c4therisches \u00d6l, Harz, Glykoside, Vitamin C\n\nDie Sternkiefer wird in der Pflanzenheilkunde innerlich und \u00e4u\u00dferlich angewendet. \nPflanzennamen im Volksmund\nIgelf\u00f6hre, Strandkiefer, See-Kiefer\nBordeaux-Kiefer, Igel-Kiefer\nStern-Kiefer, Meer-Kiefer, Seestrand-Kiefer\n\nWissenschaftlicher Name\nKieferngew\u00e4chse (Pinaceae)\n\nPflanzenfamilie\nPinus pinaster Ait.\n\nHeilkr\u00e4uter / Anwendung\nxxx\n\nBitte beachten Sie auch diesen Hinweis\n\nObwohl die Anwendungen mit Heilkr\u00e4utern oft eine positive Wirkung auf Beschwerden haben, sollte man vor der Heilpflanzenanwendung immer R\u00fccksprache mit einem Arzt halten.

La mejor manera, as\u00ed lo cree, es a trav\u00e9s del uso de drogas psicod\u00e9licas. \nEn cierto sentido, esta crisis hist\u00f3rica o esta singularidad que se aproxima, es como una transici\u00f3n desde un mundo bidimensional o tridimensional, hacia un mundo de 5 o 6 dimensiones.\nEsto es lo que yo creo que le sucede a un sistema mental humano bajo la influencia de psicod\u00e9licos. As\u00ed que de cierta manera, la mejor pr\u00e1ctica para la aproximaci\u00f3n de la singularidad es la constante disoluci\u00f3n y reconstituci\u00f3n de la personalidad a trav\u00e9s de sustancias psicod\u00e9licas.\nEsta es una de las nuevas plantas psicod\u00e9licas m\u00e1s interesantes en el mundo, es Salvia Divinorum.

They prefer Acacia, Commiphora, Combretum and open Terminalia woodlands over denser environments like Brachystegia woodlands. The Angolan giraffe can be found in desert environments.Giraffes browse on the twigs of trees, preferring trees of genera Acacia, Commiphora and Terminalia, which are important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe's growth rate. They also feed on shrubs, grass and fruit.A giraffe eats around 34 kg (75 lb) of foliage daily.When stressed, giraffes may chew the bark off branches. Although herbivorous, the giraffe has been known to visit carcasses and lick dried meat off bones.\nDuring the wet season, food is abundant and giraffes are more spread out, while during the dry season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably to make it easier to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again.It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores, because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system.The animal's feces come in the form of small pellets.When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.\nGiraffes have a great effect on the trees that they feed on, delaying the growth of young trees for some years and giving \"waistlines\" to trees that are too tall. Feeding is at its highest during the first and last hours of daytime. Between these hours, giraffes mostly stand and ruminate. Rumination is the dominant activity during the night, when it is mostly done lying down.\nSources :http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe#Habitat_and_feeding", "title": "Giraffe is Eating Leaves at Alipore Zoo,Kolkata,India", "publishedDate": "2014-10-10T04:38:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Qj6wYFrfz4", "description": "IGN guides you through the Basso side job A Lady's Bequest in Thief (2014).", "title": "Thief Walkthrough - Basso Side Mission: A Lady's Bequest", "publishedDate": "2014-03-03T20:40:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "7QjVofNEfyE", "description": "Get your 'Street Art' designs here: http://bit.ly/1c0ETCw\nFor the non-artists, you can still participate: http://bit.ly/1biTXKP\nSupport the channel & get exclusive deals: http://bit.ly/Y3er3B\n-----------------------\nSubmit current topic: Fictional Characters as Children's Book Cover Art: http://bit.ly/1mfcGKE \nGet ahead on future designs: http://bit.ly/1c0ETCw\n\nThe Drawing Board is the show where we give you guys design topics and you send in cool art.

HAD TO STOP AS ENGINE HEAT SHAFT WAS GETTING TOO HOT. This stirling engine converts heat into kinetic free energy from the sun.\n\nA Stirling engine is a heat engine operating by cyclic compression and expansion of air or other gas, the working fluid, at different temperature levels such that there is a net conversion of heat energy to mechanical work. Or more specifically, a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine with a permanently gaseous working fluid, where closed-cycle is defined as a thermodynamic system in which the working fluid is permanently contained within the system, and regenerative describes the use of a specific type of internal heat exchanger and thermal store, known as the regenerator. It is the inclusion of a regenerator that differentiates the Stirling engine from other closed cycle hot air engines.\nOriginally conceived in 1816 as an industrial prime mover to rival the steam engine, its practical use was largely confined to low-power domestic applications for over a century.\nThe Stirling engine is noted for its high efficiency compared to steam engines, quiet operation, and the ease with which it can use almost any heat source. This compatibility with alternative and renewable energy sources has become increasingly significant as the price of conventional fuels rises, and also in light of concerns such as peak oil and climate change. This engine is currently exciting interest as the core component of micro combined heat and power (CHP) units, in which it is more efficient and safer than a comparable steam engine.[", "title": "STIRLING ENGINE FRESNEL LENS SOLAR POWER GREEN ENERGY SUN Sterling Motor", "publishedDate": "2007-08-18T02:32:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Qns8txH5Ns", "description": "In which Hank rebuts John's stance on Batman by observing that Batman is not a fantasy of individuals, but a personification of anger and frustration at injustice AND our collective ability to act to make the world better. \n\nAnd then he proposes his own reason for being frustrated with Batman...because if he (and every other title-card, mass-culture hero) is supposed to personify and thus represent all of us...why do they always represent the same groups over and over and over again?\n\nProject for Awesome compilation album info: http://effyeahnerdfighters.com/post/97666367119/project-for-awesome-nerdfighter-music-compilation\n\n----\nJoin the community at http://nerdfighteria.com & http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com", "title": "I Kinda AM Batman", "publishedDate": "2014-10-10T16:25:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Qnw5pfHcck", "description": "The Woodrow Wilson Bridge carries the Capital Beltway across the Potomac River at Alexandria, Virginia, south of Washington.

The cyclical harvest and planting of trees on lands dedicated to timber and pulp production result in some of the highest rates of forest change observed in the country. Over the past 40 years scientists have used USGS-NASA Landsat satellite data to detect changes in U.S. forest cover and monitor the impact of clearings on biodiversity and water resources. The color-coded visualization highlights vegetation change from 2006 to 2010 on land located south of the Ouachita Mountains, a mountain range that runs from central Arkansas to southeastern Oklahoma. Red areas represent forests cleared in 2010; orange areas represent clearings that took place around 2006. Land that had more than 25 percent tree cover prior to 2006 is colored green, while areas with less than 25 percent appear gray.\"\n\nPublic domain film from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silviculture\n\nSilviculture is the practice of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests to meet diverse needs and values. The name comes from the Latin silvi- (forest) + culture (as in growing). The study of forests and woods is termed silvology...\n\nRegeneration\n\nForest regeneration is the act of renewing tree cover by establishing young trees naturally or artificially, generally promptly after the previous stand or forest has been removed. The method, species, and density are chosen to meet the goal of the landowner. Forest regeneration includes practices such as changes in tree plant density through human-assisted natural regeneration, enrichment planting, reduced grazing of forested savannas, and changes in tree provenances/genetics or tree species. \"Human-assisted natural regeneration\" means establishment of a forest age class from natural seeding or sprouting after harvesting through selection cutting, shelter (or seed-tree) harvest, soil preparation, or restricting the size of a clear-cut stand to secure natural regeneration from surrounding trees. \"Enrichment planting\" means increasing the planting density (i.e., the numbers of plants per hectare) in an already growing forest stand.\"\n\nCommon methods\n\nSilvicultural regeneration methods combine both the harvest of the timber on the stand and re-establishment of the forest. The proper practice of sustainable forestry[2] should mitigate the potential negative impacts, but all harvest methods will have some impacts on the land and residual stand.[3] The practice of sustainable forestry limits the impacts such that the values of the forest are maintained in perpetuity. Following are some common methods...\n\n    Clearcutting - An even-aged regeneration method that can employ either natural or artificial regeneration. Clearcutting can be biologically appropriate with species that typically regenerate from stand replacing fires or other major disturbances, such as lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). Alternatively, clearcutting can change the dominating species on a stand with the introduction of non-native and invasive species as was shown at the Blodgett Experimental Forest near Georgetown California. Additionally, clearcutting can prolong slash decomposition, expose soil to erosion, impact visual appeal of a landscape and remove essential wildlife habitat. It is particularly useful in regeneration of tree species such as Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) which is shade intolerant...\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity\n\nBiodiversity is the degree of variation of life forms within a given species, ecosystem, biome, or an entire planet. Biodiversity is a measure of the health of ecosystems. Biodiversity is in part a function of climate. In terrestrial habitats, tropical regions are typically rich whereas polar regions support fewer species.\n\nRapid environmental changes typically cause mass extinctions. One estimate is that less than 1% of the species that have existed on Earth are extant.\n\nSince life began on Earth, five major mass extinctions and several minor events have led to large and sudden drops in biodiversity....\n\nThe period since the emergence of humans has displayed an ongoing biodiversity reduction and an accompanying loss of genetic diversity.
