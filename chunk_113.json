Se debe al pinzamiento de los tendones del b\u00edceps contra el arco coracoacromial. \n\nLas causas pueden ser m\u00faltiples como practicar el saque del tenis o realizar un movimiento de seguimiento exagerado al golpear la pelota de golf. El m\u00fasculo y los tendones del b\u00edceps son susceptibles a los traumatismos, al desgaste y a la rotura por sobrecarga o mal uso.\n\nCuando el da\u00f1o es muy grave, el tend\u00f3n de la cabeza larga del b\u00edceps puede romperse, dejando al paciente con un b\u00edceps  tipo \"Popeye\" (Denominado as\u00ed por este personaje de dibujos animados). \nDada la tendinitis bicipital, el paciente presenta un dolor constante que se localiza adelante del hombro sobre el surco bicipital. Debido a este dolor, es com\u00fan que exista dificultad para dormir. El paciente puede intentar sujetar los tendones inflamados para sentir alivio. Tambi\u00e9n presenta disminuci\u00f3n gradual de la capacidad funcional, con disminuci\u00f3n del arco de movilidad del hombro, lo que hace que algunas actividades cotidianas como peinarse, abrocharse el sujetador o alcanzar un objeto elevado sean muy dificultosas. Con el desuso puede producirse una atrofia muscular y desarrollar un hombro congelado.\n\nCORTE SPORTAPES REQUERIDO PARA UNA TENDINITIS BICIPITAL\nSPORTAPES te recomienda para este tipo de lesi\u00f3n un corte de \"red\", con el fin de relajar el m\u00fasculo b\u00edceps.\nPaso 1: Realizamos un corte de una cinta de 30cm.\nPaso 2: Tomamos un extremo de la cinta y realizamos cuatro cortes con 1cm. de grosor cada uno, quedando as\u00ed cinco tiras. Dichos cortes deber\u00e1n tener una longitud de 25cm. con el fin de tener una base de 5cm.\nPaso 3: Colocamos la base en la parte superior del antebrazo a la altura del dedo pulgar.\nPaso 4: Tomamos cada una de las tiras dando una tensi\u00f3n de 10% y llev\u00e1ndolos hacia la parte inferior del hombro tomando en cuenta una separaci\u00f3n entre cada tira de 1cm.\nPaso 5: Colocamos la segunda tira al lado izquierdo de la primera cinta a la altura del dedo \u00edndice.

He's here, to talk about his memoir Hitch 22, and discussions range widely, from his childhood and the suicide of his mother to his boys' lunches with Martin Amis, Ian McEwan, Salman Rushdie and the gang.

Vanity Fair In Memoriam: Christopher Hitchens, 1949--2011, by Juli Weiner, Dec 15th 2011. Christopher Hitchens\u2014the incomparable critic, masterful rhetorician, fiery wit, and fearless bon vivant\u2014died today at the age of 62. Hitchens was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the spring of 2010, just after the publication of his memoir, Hitch-22, and began chemotherapy soon after. \"My chief consolation in this year of living dyingly has been the presence of friends,\" he wrote in the June 2011 issue. He died in their presence, too, at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. May his 62 years of living, well, so livingly console the many of us who will miss him dearly\n\nChristopher Eric Hitchens (born 13 April 1949) is an Anglo-American author and journalist whose books, essays, and journalistic career span more than four decades. He has been a columnist and literary critic at The Atlantic, Vanity Fair, Slate, World Affairs, The Nation, Free Inquiry, and became a media fellow at the Hoover Institution in September 2008. He is a staple of talk shows and lecture circuits and in 2005 was voted the world's fifth top public intellectual in a Prospect/Foreign Policy poll. He's known for his admiration of George Orwell, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Jefferson and for his excoriating critiques of, among others, Mother Teresa, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Henry Kissinger. His confrontational style of debate has made him both a lauded and controversial figure. As a political observer, polemicist and self-defined radical, he rose to prominence as a fixture of the left-wing publications in his native Britain and in the United States. His departure from the established political left began in 1989 after what he called the \"tepid reaction\" of the Western left following Ayatollah Khomeini's issue of a fatwa- calling for the murder of Salman Rushdie. The 11 September 2001 attacks strengthened his internationalist embrace of an interventionist foreign policy, and his vociferous criticism of what he called \"fascism with an Islamic face.\" His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insists he is not \"a conservative of any kind\"", "title": "Hitchens '10: Socialism", "publishedDate": "2012-10-26T03:50:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "66LDtukvQpg", "description": "", "title": "Symptoms Of Low Transmission Fluid", "publishedDate": "2011-05-02T21:08:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "66LSNxekHMw", "description": "Get to know more about Princess Alanis Pura, was crowned Queen of the Philippines 2014 while, 3 single mothers join in Miss Global Philippines.\n\nSubscribe to the ABS-CBN News channel!\nhttp://bit.ly/TheABSCBNNews\n\nWatch the full episodes of TV Patrol on TFC.TV  \nhttp://bit.ly/TVP-TFCTV\nand on IWANT.TV for Philippine viewers, click:\nhttp://bit.ly/TVP-IWANTV\n\nVisit our website at http://www.abs-cbnnews.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/abscbnNEWS\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/abscbnnews", "title": "Deaf Pinay wins Queen of the Philippines title", "publishedDate": "2014-08-05T14:50:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "66LnhtnSoKc", "description": "Music video by P!nk performing There You Go.

It is a book of conversations between the two men first released in Spanish in 2010, and now published in English\n\nIn this book we encounter Cardinal Bergoglio in his own words.\nThe Council's pan-religious program is central to his thinking. His commitment to Pentecostalism is one such instance.\nThe Joint \"Blessing\"\n\nOn June 19, 2009, the Third Annual Fraternal Encounter of Evangelicals and Catholics was held in Luna Park stadium, Buenos Aires. Cardinal Bergoglio attended.\n\nAt one point, as is characteristic in these Pentecostal gatherings, the Cardinal dropped to his knees on stage to receive the \"blessing\" from a number of Protestant pastors.\n\nAll speculation is put to rest on this point when we read page 220 of the newly released On Heaven and Earth. Cardinal Bergoglio states with pride that he knowingly permitted the joint blessing to take place.\nThe Cardinal says, \"The first time that the Evangelicals invited me to one of their meetings at Luna Park, the stadium was full. That day a Catholic priest [Father Cantalamessa] and an Evangelical Pastor spoke. They gave two talks each, interspersed with a break to eat some sandwiches at noon. At one point the Evangelical pastor asked that everyone pray for me and my ministry. He had asked me if I would accept that they would pray for me and I answered him that of course I would. When they prayed, the first thing that occurred to me was to kneel down, a very Catholic gesture, to receive their prayer and the blessing of the seven thousand people that were there. The next week, a magazine headline stated: 'Buenos Aires, sede vacante. The Archbishop commits the sin of apostasy.' For them, prayer together with others was apostasy. Even with an agnostic, with his doubt, we can look up together to find transcendence; each one praying according to his tradition. What's the problem?\"\n\nThe March 14 Christianity Today wrote that Argentine Evangelicals were overjoyed at Bergoglio's election: \"Bergoglio has played a central role in Argentina's CRECES (Renewal Communion of Catholics and Evangelicals in the Holy Spirit) movement over the past 10 years, and has strongly supported the Argentine [Protestant] Bible society.\"\nAnother instance of Cardinal Bergoglio's ecumenical thinking is recounted by Gren Venables, Anglican Bishop of Argentina (and former archbishop of the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone). Venables recounts that while still in Argentina, Cardinbal Bergoglio \"called me to have breakfast with him one morning and told me very clearly that the Ordinariate [created by the Catholic Church to accommodate alienated Anglicans] was quite unnecessary and that the Church needs us to be Anglicans.\"\n\nCardinal Bergoglio's attitude echoes the ecumenical theology of Walter Cardinal Kasper who said in 2003, \"Several aspects of being church are better realized in other churches. Therefore, ecumenism is no one-way street, but a reciprocal learning process, or, as stated in Ut Unum Sint, an exchange of gifts. The way to unity is therefore not the return of others into the fold of the Catholic Church.\"\n\n\"What's the Problem?\"\n\nCardinal Bergoglio, as quoted earlier, seems puzzled as to why anyone would have a problem with him praying in public with Protestants or dropping to his knees to receive a joint blessing from both Catholic and Protestant ministers. \"What's the problem?\" he wonders.\n\nDoes he really mean this? Is he really baffled as to why joint public prayers with Catholics and Protestants would be considered scandalous? Is he not aware of the numerous papal pronouncements against religious indifferentism and ecumenical activities over the past 160 years?\nThe Council of Trent solemnly anathematizes those who reject the Catholic doctrine of the Eucharist, the Catholic doctrine on the Sacrament of Confession, the Catholic doctrine on the Sacrament of Holy Orders, the list goes on and on. Bergoglio's actions effectively tell Protestants that the Council of Trent does not matter.\n\nThe Popes up to 1958 forcefully condemned ecumenical and interreligious activity. Pope Pius XI, in his 1928 Encyclical Mortalium Animos, forbade the type of ecumenism nurtured since the Council. He said the Holy See has \"never allowed\" its subjects to take part in the ecumenical assemblies, \"nor is it lawful for Catholics to support or work for such (ecumenical) enterprises, for if they do so they will be giving countenance to a false Christianity, quite alien to the one Church of Christ\".", "title": "Francisco sigue predicando el indiferentismo y el Sincretismo religioso", "publishedDate": "2014-06-09T21:32:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "66Nf9T5CGi8", "description": "Litwo!

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com features a stable of club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, who deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.\n \nMajor League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues. The American League, originally founded in 1901, consists of the following teams: Baltimore Orioles; Boston Red Sox; Chicago White Sox; Cleveland Indians; Detroit Tigers; Houston Astros; Kansas City Royals; Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; Minnesota Twins; New York Yankees; Oakland Athletics; Seattle Mariners; Tampa Bay Rays; Texas Rangers; and Toronto Blue Jays. The National League, originally founded in 1876, consists of the following teams: Arizona Diamondbacks; Atlanta Braves; Chicago Cubs; Cincinnati Reds; Colorado Rockies; Los Angeles Dodgers; Miami Marlins; Milwaukee Brewers; New York Mets; Philadelphia Phillies; Pittsburgh Pirates; San Diego Padres; San Francisco Giants; St. Louis Cardinals; and Washington Nationals.\n \nVisit MLB.com: http://mlb.mlb.com\nSubscribe to MLB.TV: mlb.tv\nDownload MLB.com At Bat: http://mlb.mlb.com/mobile/atbat\nGet tickets: http://mlb.mlb.com/tickets\nOfficial MLB Merchandise: http://mlb.mlb.com/shop\n \nJoin the conversation!\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/mlb\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/mlb\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/mlb\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+MLB\nTumblr: http://drawntomlb.com/\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/MLBAM", "title": "Harper drilled in the knee", "publishedDate": "2013-08-08T21:30:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "66aWBtTeTHY", "description": "SO CUTE I CAN'T!!

For the infant, however, there \nare many positional changes that assist the baby in the passage through the birth canal. Because \nof the resistance met by the baby, positional changes are \nspecific, deliberate and precise as they allow the smallest \ndiameter of the baby to pass through a corresponding\ndiameter of the woman's pelvic structure. Neither care\nproviders nor the laboring woman is directly responsible for \nthese position changes. The baby is the one responsible for \nthese position changes ~ the cardinal movements.\n\nEngagement  or the entering of the biparietal diameter\n(measuring ear tip to ear tip across the top of the baby's head) \ninto the pelvic inlet.\n\nDescent\nThe baby's head moves deep into the pelvic cavity and is \ncommonly called lightening. The baby's head becomes markedly\nmolded when these distances are closely the same. When the occiput is \nat the level of the ischial spines, it can be assumed that the biparietal \ndiameter is engaged and then descends into the pelvic inlet.\n\nFlexion\nThis movement occurs during descent and is brought about by the \nresistance felt by the baby's head against the soft tissues of the pelvis. \nThe resistance brings about a flexion in the baby's head so that the chin \nmeets the chest. The smallest diameter of the baby's head (or\nsuboccipitobregmatic plane) presents into the pelvis.\n\nInternal rotation\nAs the head reaches the pelvic floor, it typically rotates to accommodate \nfor the change in diameters of the pelvis. At the pelvic inlet, the diameter \nof the pelvis is widest from right to left. At the pelvic outlet, the \ndiameter is widest from front to back. So the baby must move from a \nsideways position to one where the sagittal suture is in the \nanteroposterior diameter of the outlet (where the face of the baby is \nagainst the back of the laboring woman and the back of the baby's head \nis against the front of the pelvis). If anterior rotation does not occur, the \nocciput (or head) rotates to the occipitoposterior position.

Its populations have been estimated at 1,706\u20131,909 in India, 440 in Bangladesh, 163\u2013253 in Nepal and 67\u201381 in Bhutan. Since 2010, it has been classified as endangered by the IUCN. The total population is estimated at fewer than 2,500 individuals with a decreasing trend, and none of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within the Bengal tiger's range is large enough to support an effective population size of 250 adult individuals.\nBengal is traditionally fixed as the typical locality for the binomial Panthera tigris, to which the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the Bengal tiger in 1929 under the trinomial Panthera tigris tigris.\nTigers are carnivores. They prefer hunting large ungulates such as chital, sambar, gaur, and to a lesser extent also barasingha, water buffalo, nilgai, serow and takin. Among the medium-sized prey species they frequently kill wild boar, and occasionally hog deer, muntjac and Gray langur. Small prey species such as porcupines, hares and peafowl form a very small part in their diet. Due to the encroachment of humans into their habitat, they also prey on domestic livestock.\nIn most cases, tigers approach their victim from the side or behind from as close a distance as possible and grasp the prey's throat to kill it. Then they drag the carcass into cover, occasionally over several hundred meters, to consume it. The nature of the tiger's hunting method and prey availability results in a \"feast or famine\" feeding style: they often consume 18\u201340 kilograms (40\u201388 lb) of meat at one time.\nBengal tigers have been known to take other predators, such as leopards, wolves, jackals, foxes, crocodiles, Asiatic black bears, sloth bears, and dholes as prey, although these predators are not typically a part of their diet. Adult elephants and rhinoceroses are too large to be successfully tackled by tigers, but such extraordinarily rare events have been recorded. The Indian hunter and naturalist Jim Corbett described an incident in which two tigers fought and killed a large bull elephant. If injured, old or weak, or their normal prey is becoming scarce, they may even attack humans and become man-eaters.\nOver the past century tiger numbers have fallen dramatically, with a decreasing population trend. None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within the Bengal tiger range is large enough to support an effective population size of 250 individuals. Habitat losses and the extremely large-scale incidences of poaching are serious threats to the species' survival.\nThe challenge in the Western Ghats forest complex in western South India, an area of 14,400 square miles (37,000 km2) stretching across several protected areas is that people literally live on top of the wildlife. The Save the Tiger Fund Council estimates that 7,500 landless people live illegally inside the boundaries of the 386-square-mile (1,000 km2) Nagarhole National Park in southwestern India. A voluntary if controversial resettlement is underway with the aid of the Karnataka Tiger Conservation Project led by K. Ullas Karanth of the Wildlife Conservation Society.\nA 2007 report by UNESCO, \"Case Studies on Climate Change and World Heritage\" has stated that an anthropogenic 45-cm rise in sea level, likely by the end of the 21st century, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, combined with other forms of anthropogenic stress on the Sundarbans, could lead to the destruction of 75% of the Sundarbans mangroves.The Forest Rights Act passed by the Indian government in 2006 grants some of India's most impoverished communities the right to own and live in the forests, which likely brings them into conflict with wildlife and under-resourced, under-trained, ill-equipped forest department staff. In the past, evidence showed that humans and tigers cannot co-exist.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bengal_Tiger", "title": "The Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris),Alipore Zoo,Kolkata,India", "publishedDate": "2014-07-27T13:29:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "66waDYFVvH0", "description": "Shop Now: http://www.testequipmentdepot.com/keithley/test-systems/4200-scs.htm?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=demo+video&utm_campaign=manufacturer\n\nThe easy-to-use Keithley 4200-SCS Semiconductor Characterization System performs lab grade DC and pulse device characterization, real-time plotting, and analysis with high precision and sub-femtoamp resolution.

Composed of defected Syrian Armed Forces personnel and volunteers, its formation was announced on 29 July 2011 in a video released on the internet by a uniformed group of deserters from the Syrian military who called upon members of the Syrian army to defect and join them. The FSA's leader in August 2011, Colonel Riad al-Asaad, announced that the FSA would work with demonstrators to bring down the regime, and declared that all security forces attacking civilians were justified targets. The FSA coordinated with the Syrian National Council starting in December 2011, and supported the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces after the coalition's November 2012 creation. A major reorganisation of the FSA command structure occurred in December 2012, with al-Asaad retaining his formal role but losing effective power and Brigadier General Salim Idris becoming Chief of Staff and effective leader. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, in December 2013, General Idris was driven out of his headquarters in northern Syria by the Islamic Front and is now in exile in Doha, Qatar, though the FSA has denied this.\nFont wikipedia", "title": "Free Syrian army 2014 FSA attack military base with new weapons", "publishedDate": "2014-03-20T23:18:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "670Vt2aQj40", "description": "My idea of Campaign is located on Reading Viaduct.

This guide on how to make perfect candy apples offers tips and advice on preparing delicious candy apples. \n\nThe candy apple is prepared by dipping fresh \napples into a candy coating, and allowing for it to dry, creating a hard candy shell. The coating can be dyed using food coloring to match any theme, and a number of toppings can be added to the candy apple to suit any taste. While the recipe is simple to follow, candy apples should be prepared with caution and with the supervision of an adult, as the candy coating becomes hot as it cooks. \n\nPreparing candy apples can be a fun project for cooks of all ages and skill level. Read on to learn how to make perfect candy apples.\n\nStep 1: Gather Your Equipment\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Wooden skewers or popsicle sticks\n\n* 2. Buy them at your local grocery or \n\nparty supply store.\n* 3. You can also buy bamboo skewers and cut them in half.\n\nCandy thermometer\n\n* 5. A candy thermometer is very important, especially if you're making candy apples for the first time. You'll need it to make sure your heated sugar reaches the right stage of completion. Judging otherwise can easily lead you to burnt or underdone coatings. However, the thermometer is not necessary if you are just melting chocolate.\n\n* 6. Make sure your thermometer's accurate.  Being off by just a few degrees can mean the difference between delicious and burnt. To check its accuracy, clip on your candy thermometer and set a pot of water to boil. The thermometer should read 212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius when the water is boiling. If not, note what temperature it reads at and adjust for the difference.\n\n7. Pot for making the candy coating\n\n8. Second container, bigger than your cooking pot\n\n* 9. If you heat your coating to a high enough temperature, you'll fill this container with cold water to submerge and cool the pot with your candy apple coating.\n\n10. Tray or baking sheet (for completed apples)\n\n* 11. Aluminum foil: you'll need this if you do not want to put your finished apples directly on an oiled baking sheet, tray, or serving platter.\n\n* 12. Alternatively, you can top your baking sheet with a silpat mat.\n\n13. Measuring cups and spoons\n\n14. Wooden spoon\n\n15. Pastry brush, to keep sugar from crystallizing as you work\n\n16. Extra bowls for additional toppings\n\nStep 2: Choosing Your Apples\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMaking a candy apple is about pairing the sweetness of candy with the right apple. It's exquisite to pair a tart apple with a sweet candy exterior. Of course, if you can't stand tart apples, then pick a sweeter one. However, you want to eschew varieties like Red Delicious, which lacks the firmness required for candy apples, and Rome Beauty, which is primarily used in \nbaking. Recommended apples include:\n\n* * Braeburn: Golden-green to red skin, firm, sweetly tart\n\n* * Fuji: Yellow-green skin, firm, sweet\n\n* * Golden Delicious: golden skin, firm, sweet\n\n* * Granny Smith: green skin, very firm, tart\n\n* * Jonathan: Yellow-red skin, firm, sweetly tart\n\n* * Jonagold: A hybrid of Jonathan and Golden Delicious, firm skin, tangily sweet\n\n* * Lady: Red to yellow skin, firm, sweetly tart\n\n* * McIntosh: Reddish-green skin, firm, sweetly tart\n\n1. Choose smaller apples - they'll be easier to make, easier to eat, and will give you a better candy to apple ratio!\n\n2. Store-bought apples are usually coated with wax, which makes it more difficult to coat them. If possible, buy apples at a farmer's market. Or you can go apple picking and get your own fresh off the tree!\n\n3. If you have no choice but to use wax-coated apples, quickly dip them in boiling water and then wipe away the wax coating.\nhttp://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/1024274. Chill the apples in the refrigerator until you're ready to start making candy apples.\n\nStep 3: Prepare Your Kitchen\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Get everything gathered before you put the sugar on the stove. You don't want to rush off for your pastry brush and come back to find a pot full of crystallized sugar.\n\n1. Put your pastry brush in a cup of warm water.\n\n2. Butter your baking sheet or tray (or aluminum foil) so it's ready to hold coated apples.\n\n3. Fill the second,\n\nRead more by visiting our page at:\nhttp://www.mahalo.com/how-to-make-perfect-candy-apples/", "title": "How to Make Perfect Candy Apples", "publishedDate": "2010-10-20T01:55:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "6717u6AMs_8", "description": "A weekly look at some of the events and activities at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nFor more information:\n\nhttp://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentid=2014/04/0050.xml&navid=NEWS_RELEASE&navtype=RT&parentnav=LATEST_RELEASES&edeployment_action=retrievecontent\n\nhttp://www.aphis.usda.gov/wps/portal/aphis/home/\n\nhttp://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=DISASTER_ASSISTANCE\n\nhttp://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/webapp?area=home&subject=landing&topic=landing\n\nhttp://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=farmbill", "title": "This Week @ USDA April 4", "publishedDate": "2014-04-04T15:34:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "671iQ7uQmNs", "description": "En este video se muestra una t\u00e9cnica sencilla para planificar un proyecto de manera \u00e1gil, iterativa e incremental, en un workshop conjuntamente con el cliente.

In this condition, the mucus in patients nasal cavities is thickened and hyper-secreted. This thickening causes mucus to be expelled less frequently. Japanese researchers evaluated the effects of serratia peptidase (30 mg/day orally for four weeks) on the elasticity and viscosity of the nasal mucus in adult patients with chronic sinusitis. Serratia peptidase reduced the viscosity of the mucus, improving the elimination of broncho-pulmonary secretions.\n\nSerrapeptase alters the elasticity of mucus without depleting it. In one study, 140 patients with acute or chronic ear, nose and throat pathologies were evaluated with either a placebo or the active serratia peptidase. Patients taking the serrapeptase experienced a significant reduction in severity of pain, amount of secretion, purulence of secretions, difficulty in swallowing, nasal dysphonia, nasal obstruction, anosmia, and body temperature after three to four days and at the end of treatment. \n\nPatients suffering from laryngitis, catarrhal rhinopharyngitis and sinusitis who were treated with serrapeptase experienced a significant and rapid improvement of symptoms after 3-4 days. Physicians assessed efficacy of treatment as excellent or good for 97.3 percent of patients treated with serrapeptase compared with only 21.9 percent of those treated with a placebo.\n\nhttp://www.takebackyourhealth.com/blog/", "title": "Systemic Enzymes, Serrapeptase and Sinusitis", "publishedDate": "2009-11-30T10:22:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "674ioAS0foU", "description": "\"In An 18th Century Drawing Room\" performed by Stu Brown's Raymond Scott Project at Kings Place, London, 14th October 2008.

Common rail Diesel fuel injection is now the state of the art in engine injection. The Bosch Piezoelectric (crystal) injector operates using a crystal stack, usually Quartz, that changes size when energized. The piezoelectric effect states that when a crystal such a Quarts is squeezed an electric current is generated. By the same token, when electricity is applied to the crystal is changes shape. This minute change in crystal size is used to trigger a small fuel chamber on and off. In turn, this chamber creates a pressure differential at the top of the injector which make it open and close.

Today's demand for such a high level of aesthetics and predictability require a collaborative effort between the dentist and technician. This seminar investigates the factors that allow a relationship between the dentist and technician to result in extraordinary and predictable results. Historically, restorations have been fabricated to work within an \"envelope of function\". Remember, when we chew, teeth actually don't touch. Given that fact, it isn't during the envelope of function that teeth or restorations fail. Instead, it is when we extend beyond and into the \"Envelope of Parafunction\" that destruction occurs. If we can create restorations that exist within this envelope of parafunction, we have better opportunity for success. This presentation introduces the \"Outside/Inside\" evaluation. This refers to seven specific steps that must be considered when developing any treatment plan. Following these steps result in restorations that are aesthetic and functional while improving predictability. Other factors that contribute to consistency and predictable restorations will be discussed.\n\nDescription of Speaker:\nMichael C. Fling, D.D.S. began his career in dentistry in 1976 as a laboratory technician. Graduating from Oklahoma University College of Dentistry in 1984, he received the \"Young Dentist of the Year Award\" in 1988 from the Oklahoma Dental Association. Maintaining a private practice with an emphasis on aesthetic and restorative dentistry, he has served as Course Director and as Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of Fixed Prosthodontics at the O.U. College of Dentistry. He is the founder and President of \"Fling Seminars\", providing advanced dental education to dental teams and technicians throughout the country. He has been named by Dentistry Today as one of the \"Top Clinicians in Continuing Education\" since 2005. Currently he serves as a guest lecturer at O.U. College of Dentistry in the Department of Fixed Prosthodontics and as an Associate Faculty at the L.D. Pankey Institute. Dr. Fling is also on staff with the Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) Residency Program at the O.U. College of Dentistry. He is part of a select handful that has completed the process to earn the distinction as a \"Pankey Scholar\". As a member of the American Academy of Restorative Dentistry, the American Academy of Fixed Prosthodontics, and the American College of Dentists, he has lectured internationally to dental and laboratory associations and to various study groups on fundamental principles of aesthetic and restorative dentistry, philosophical and managerial concepts, and achieving technical excellence.\n\nEducational Objectives:\nUpon completion of this course, participants should be able to achieve the following:\n1. Seven essential steps of treatment planning for aesthetics and predictability\n2. Implications of occlusion disease and its relation to success\n3. Understanding incisal edge position and tooth length\n4. Importance of Anterior Guidance and angle of disclusion\n5. \"Simple\" Restorative Sequence\n6.

But the busy shipping traffic close to the port areas poses a huge threat to their survival,\" said Wang.\n\nResearchers found denser distribution of finless porpoises in waters that are not open to navigation and attributed this to less human disturbance.\n\nBut evidence of illegal fishing practices were discovered in these areas, including traps.\n\nLei Gang, director of the freshwater program at WWF-China, warned urgent measures are essential to save the species from extinction.\n\nWith that in mind, the report called for year-round fishing ban for all river dolphin reserves, the establishment of a national reserve in Poyang Lake, and conservation reserves along the Yangtze.\n\nAttempts to look for traces of the Baiji Dolphin, another rare cetacean and close relative of the finless porpoise, failed during the survey. As a result, the Baiji dolphin has been declared \"functionally extinct\" by the report.", "title": "Rare porpoise in danger of extinction", "publishedDate": "2013-06-20T21:42:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "67RXf5P7bfg", "description": "We present a vision based control strategy for tracking and following objects using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.

The algorithm is validated using a Parrot AR Drone 2.0 in outdoor conditions while tracking and following people, occlusions and also fast moving objects; showing the robustness of the proposed systems against perturbations and illumination changes.

They are seen in many types of animals, including vertebrates and some invertebrates. They are an essential part of the urinary system and also serve homeostatic functions such as the regulation of electrolytes, maintenance of acid-base balance, and regulation of blood pressure. They serve the body as a natural filter of the blood, and remove wastes which are diverted to the urinary bladder. In producing urine, the kidneys excrete wastes such as urea and ammonium; the kidneys also are responsible for the reabsorption of water, glucose, and amino acids. The kidneys also produce hormones including calcitriol, renin, and erythropoietin.\n\nLocated behind the abdominal cavity in the retroperitoneum, the kidneys receive blood from the paired renal arteries, and drain into the paired renal veins. Each kidney excretes urine into a ureter, itself a paired structure that empties into the urinary bladder.\n\nRenal physiology is the study of kidney function, while nephrology is the medical specialty concerned with kidney diseases. Diseases of the kidney are diverse, but individuals with kidney disease frequently display characteristic clinical features. Common clinical conditions involving the kidney include the nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, renal cysts, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis, and urinary tract obstruction.[1] Various cancers of the kidney exist; the most common adult renal cancer is renal cell carcinoma. Cancers, cysts, and some other renal conditions can be managed with removal of the kidney, or nephrectomy. When renal function, measured by glomerular filtration rate, is persistently poor, dialysis and kidney transplantation may be treatment options. Alhough they are not severely harmful, kidney stones can be a pain and a nuisance. The removal of kidney stones includes sound wave treatment, which breaks up the stones into smaller pieces which are then passed through the urinary tract. Common symptoms of kidney stones includes a common feeling of a knife of fire being stabbed into the lower back.\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "The Kidneys", "publishedDate": "2010-05-04T05:39:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "67YgVRZS8Z4", "description": "Find out how the tech, aviation, and design of Goodyear's new airship stack up to its predecessors. \n\nWatch WIRED on The Scene: http://thescene.com\n\nSubscribe to the all-new WIRED channel here: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCftwRNsjfRo08xYE31tkiyw?sub_confirmation=1\nVisit the WIRED channel for more video: http://www.youtube.com/WIRED\nVisit WIRED Videos for more: http://video.wired.com\n\nConnect with WIRED Online:\nVisit WIRED.com: http://www.WIRED.com\nFollow WIRED on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WIRED\nFollow WIRED on Google+: https://plus.google.com/+WIRED/posts\nFollow WIRED on Twitter: https://twitter.com/WIRED \nFollow WIRED on Instagram: http://instagram.com/WIRED\nFollow WIRED on Tumblr: http://WIRED.tumblr.com\n\n\nGoodyear Blimp Part 2: How Many Pilots Does it Take to Fly the New Goodyear Airship? - WIRED", "title": "Goodyear Blimp Part 2: How Many Pilots Does it Take to Fly the New Goodyear Airship? - WIRED", "publishedDate": "2014-08-29T10:32:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "67Yh78y-zpQ", "description": "http://www.steveshydroponics.ca\n\nTreating Powdery Mildew In The Grow Room\n\nImproving grow room conditions is an excellent way to passively prevent and minimize damage by powdery mildew.\nMonitor humidity levels. A quality humidity gauge should be used to monitor day and night relative humidity levels. Avoid prolonged high humidity levels: 50-60% relative humidity is ideal. Humidity must be kept below 70% during the night; levels over 80% will guarantee infection within 48 hrs.\nVentilation. Constant air movement inhibits mildew, and lowers humidity. Use oscillating fans on all sides of a garden to circulate the air. Ventilate air out of the grow room periodically during the night cycle to reduce humidity from irrigation and transpiration.\nOnce mildew is established, oscillating fans may actually spread spores throughout the garden. Stop fans, treat infected areas, and then resume airflow.\nHeat night air. Warm air holds more moisture than colder air. Heat helps dry the air and lower humidity during the night cycle. Heat the room at night and exhaust the room periodically to remove this warm/moist air.\nDehumidifier.Very effective in preventing mildew from spreading. Set controls for 40-60% and let run during night cycle.\nHepa filter. Filter the intake with a Hepa filter to eliminate spores from entering room. Inspect and change filter frequently.\nIonizer or Ozone generators. Produce some output to kill airborne pathogens and spores.\nSulphur burner. These devices vaporize (not burn) elemental sulphur, coat the room with a fine film of sulphur, inhibiting PM spores from germinating.

Oxygen is the key to a high growth rate. Without oxygen around the roots, the root cells would die leading to rootrot (pythium) problems and the eventual death of the plant.\n\nYou cannot grow in water unless you have dissolved oxygen in it, so a well oxygenated nutrient solution is essential for a healthy rootzone. The fine root hairs take up the nutrients and oxygen, and obviously the more root development, the more nutrients the plant can take up, hence a healthier plant and better yields!\n\nIf you have still and stagnant water you're asking for trouble because that will cause root death due to oxygen depletion, which in turn could cause Pythium (a fungal disease) to run rampant, or even attract harmful bugs like the scarid fly (Fungus Gnat).\n\nRecirculating Systems add that essential element to hydroponics: OXYGEN. When oxygen increases, so does growth, and in many ways it is more important to consider than nutrients.\n\nRootzone temperature also plays a very important part in overall tank control, and the ability for plants to take up oxygen, water and nutrient. The ideal rootzone temperature is between 20 and 24\u00b0C. If the temperature falls below 20\u00b0C plant growth will begin to slow, and if it reaches 14\u00b0C, plant growth will stop altogether. On the other hand if the rootzone temperature rise above 24\u00b0C the need for oxygen by the plant increases as the dissolved oxygen that is in the tank decreases. This can have a devastating effect on the plant and can accelerate outbreaks of pythium spores and other rootzone diseases.\n\nGolden rule of oxygen - plants cannot take up their nutrients unless oxygen is present. The more oxygen, the faster the uptake of nutrient...but watch the temperature too! \nOxygenation Of Nutrient Solution\n\n\nhttp://www.steveshydroponics.ca", "title": "Oxygenation Of Nutrient Solution | Hydroponics Halifax", "publishedDate": "2013-06-25T17:14:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "67ctXYh8rfg", "description": "Todd Nelson with Bountiful Farms highlights the Green Mountain Boxwood plants", "title": "Plant Highlight - Green Mountain Boxwood", "publishedDate": "2010-12-29T06:52:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "67dF8JJwM3U", "description": "Dragonball Z Budokai 3 HD Collection: Plains\ninstagram.com/only1dp", "title": "Dragonball Z Budokai 3 HD Collection: Plains", "publishedDate": "2014-01-02T15:29:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "67dcG8OjUi0", "description": "The point I'm trying to make with all my iSolo videos is that any player can solo every single non-raid battle (even raids are soloable, but not always by \"any\" player). I'm doing this with the minimum level allowed each battle, except for a few missions where the exp given during other missions and main storyline, as well as the side quests for important skills like Nimble Dash and Critical Hit, were too great to stop me from leveling.\n\nThere are a few reasons I chose to do iSolo videos in normal mode and with the easiest oath or none at all:\n1. Normal mode gives more HP to the boss, thereby forcing me to keep up whatever strategy I figure out during the making of the video (or prior knowledge of the boss from past playthroughs).\n2. Combat exp is lessened during normal mode, as compared to hard or hero modes, and will help prevent premature leveling.\n3. Normal mode shows the boss HP, whereas hard and hero do not. This allows me to gain the extra BP (battle points) from the mission to make my progression to later missions faster, which enables me to do many missions with just one playthrough, thereby-- again-- helping to prevent premature leveling.\n4. Normal mode helps understand what attacks one should use, in that I am always aware of how much damage a certain type of attack does, whether that attack be from an object, secondary weapon, or a specific attack combination from iSolo, himself.\n\nAlso, please note that I will rarely (if ever) use potions during these videos. I feel that using potions during normal mode is basically infinite HP, being that the damage done is cut by quite a bit. There are moments during these videos that, had they been on hard or obviously hero modes, I would most certainly have been killed. This does NOT give me pause, however. The point, again, is to show the bosses moves and a players ability to run a mission and develop strategy on the fly.\n\nI do not practice these missions. I have played them before with my main character, but many of these bosses feel new to me; its been so long since having to actually worry about dodging. My main character is a Spear Lann, not swords. Add to that, he is a capped exp and AP character with the highest weapon and armor available, both of which are highly upgraded.\n\nThe point I am making with this statement is that I'm not used to these bosses, I'm not used to swords, and I'm definitely not used to \"worrying\" about dying during a run. My main is in an amazing guild called Samsara and we are very highly ranked on the west server with many uniquely active players (not alts). I rarely solo with my main as that is not community-oriented enough for me. Soloing is purely a fascination, not something I strive to be able to accomplish, especially not with perfection. I will get hit. I will die. I am ok with that. Live and learn and help those you care about.\n\nI hope this all makes sense :)", "title": "Vindictus - Hoarfrost Depths - Windgun - Ailliagh", "publishedDate": "2011-05-01T00:23:12.000Z"}, {"_id":

of Florida Entertainment Production Tax Incentive Program:\n\nThe State of Florida Office of Film & Entertainment administers the program and has currently pre-certified all of the tax credits through the life of the program (2016).\n\nWith No tax credits available, new projects are forced to \"get in line\" to await to see if a project falls out of the queue.\n\nThis allows time for these projects to explore other opportunities in States that have well-funded and long term film & entertainment tax incentive programs.\n\nFilm Florida is actively meeting with Legislators, the Department of Economic Opportunity and the Governor's office to provide accurate information and guidance on how to create a long-term, consistent and funded program.\n\nA Legislative Bill is anticipated to be endorsed in the beginning of 2014 to create a better program for the film and entertainment industry.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @FilmFlorida. Stay tuned to @FilmFlorida on Facebook for updates.\n\nYOU can be part of the effort by familiarizing yourself with the facts listed in the Advocacy Tool Kit on www.FilmFlorida.org, and reaching out to your local legislator with your story and by joining Film Florida.\n\n**A HUGE thank you to Filmscape Productions (www.filmscapepro.com) for creating this incredible highlights video!**", "title": "Film Florida - Orlando Legislative Forum 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-01-31T15:32:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "67i_gkUad-M", "description": "Povodny slovensky kinodabing - SpUZF - r.

Beloved for her trend-setting fashion designs as well as her political activism, Georgiana's fire and wit make her a beloved figure everywhere but her own home, where her cold and distant husband's control over her is stifling, soon sending her into the arms of a another man -- an act that soon forces her to learn about the brutal difference in the rights afforded to 18th century men and women.\n\n\"the duchess\",\"the duchess clip\",\"the duchess part 1\",\"the duchess trailer\",\"keira knightley\",\"laura stevely\",\"john shrapnel\",\"saul dibb\",\"baby videos\",\"romantic dramas\",drama,\"dramas based on real life\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"united kingdom\",\"david m thompson\",\"cameron mccracken\",\"christine langan\",\"colleen woodcock\",\"jill tandy\",\"carolyn marks blackwood\",\"gabrielle tana\",\"alexandra arlango\",\"andrew semans\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++374434,/m/0g1zb1,/m/01l2fn", "title": "The Duchess (8/9) Movie CLIP - Her Name Is Eliza (2008) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T14:21:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "67kMFFRAUDU", "description": "Men have viagra, now there's a new drug for the ladies!", "title": "Female Viagra Bit", "publishedDate": "2009-11-25T17:23:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "67k_LkJ6Ae4", "description": "", "title": "ARMA 2 CO - Test A-10 Mando Missile - JDAM, LGB CAM", "publishedDate": "2014-05-02T17:26:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "67l7DRpjNls", "description": "2014 Mitsubishi Mirage 5 Speed Manual \n\nSorry about the shaky camera, just wanted to share my thoughts.\n\nMy Fan page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Intechdude300/294626333932309\n2theRedline fan page: https://www.facebook.com/2Redline\nThe new 2theRedlineLLC channel:  http://www.youtube.com/user/2theRedlineLLC\nMy personal Instagram: http://instagram.com/lilochris13\nIntechdude300 on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Intechdude300", "title": "2014 Mitsubishi Mirage 5 Speed Manual Quick Drive & Brief 1st Impression", "publishedDate": "2014-04-17T06:19:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "67lXfK376nA", "description": "Parus - Uran\nCinortele", "title": "Parus - Uran", "publishedDate": "2013-04-22T11:23:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "67lhHun5KQk", "description": "Get more details on 2014 Deep Research Report on Global and China Liquid Crystal Polymer Industry @ http://www.deepresearchreports.com/111604.html.", "title": "2014 Global & China Liquid Crystal Polymer Market", "publishedDate": "2014-04-29T12:38:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "67lz_Op5Us8", "description": "Long-tailed paradise whydah dan pin-tailed whydah termasuk spesies yang unik karena memiliki ekor yang panjang, dan suara kicauan yang bisa dimanfaatkan untuk memaster burung lainnya.\nTRISAKTI BIRD FARM Menyediakan 2 macam jenis burung ini.

Fresh meat is always being grilled at a separate bar. The taste is good and you will always find something you like. If you prefer Fast Food, you get Pizza, Hot Dogs, Burgers and French Fries every day. The big deserts could make you gain some pounds. But fruits and salad is also available for the healthy eating people.\n- Staff was really friendly and helpful\n- The airport is about 15-20 minutes away by bus\n- rooms and hotel is clean\n- Visit Granada or Seville, its really worse the travel\n- However expect to pay everything extra if not included in you general bill. Internet costs 5 Euro a day! Avoid the internet zone where you put coins in it. It just eats your money.\n- The sauna did not look inviting (see picture in video) - but I never tried\n- The fitness equipment is outdated and needs restoration\n\nMy evalution base:\nLocation, cleanliness, staff - I can recommend this hotel.\n\nInfos to the video:\n- Room seen is not a seaview room. It is smaller than the general size, but furniture is the same. The bigger ones are just longer and offer therefore more space. \n- Pictures were taking in fall of 2013, which is not the main season. Mostly retired people or people for special events\n- Pictures were taking by myself with Canon 550D and iPhone 4\n- Pictures were taking directly into the video - no retouching, no colorgrading.

And in the SEC, that coin is carried by the bag man, a fan who believes he's leveraging football success $500 or $50,000 at a time.\n\nLast week, SB Nation posted a great long-form article on the shadow-world of bag men paying paying college football players. \n \nA college football bag man can draw attention to himself, but never importance. He will never be famous or be the annoying rich guy hovering next to the coach right after a big game. \n\nBag men operate in clandestine spots like the Waffle House. They talk in person as much as possible and stay out of the public eye. Like drug dealers, they carry lots of burners.\n\nThey don't have an FDIC-insured bank account, but a pool of money can be accessed quickly for things like large single sums to convince a recruit to sign or maintenance payments to current players.\n\nBag men live close to campus so they can meet up with their players to give them frequent payments of $200 to $500. It's also easy to get used mid-range SUVs for players. \n\nThe way they see it, if you can help the team win games on the field and also help a struggling family out, then why not. It's called the SEC for a reason, it's about straight earning cash. \n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

The studies show that the mechanics of primate lip smacking are distinct from those of chewing, similar to the separate mechanics of human speech and chewing. X-ray movies of adult rhesus macaques showed that lip smacking (left) results in a fast, loosely coordinated movement of internal structures such as the lips (green dot), tongue (red dot) and hyoid (blue dot) \u2014 just as in human speech. Also similar to humans, chewing (right) produced a slow, tightly coordinated movement of these components in macaques. These parallels suggest that in primates chewing and lip smacking \u2014 as with chewing and speech-related facial movement in humans \u2014 have separate neural controls. \n\nWith further study, the neural pathway in primates from the brain to facial mechanics could help illuminate the neurological basis of speech disorders in humans. \n\n(Videos courtesy of Asif Ghazanfar)\n\nRead more at Futurity: http://www.futurity.org", "title": "Primate lip smacking", "publishedDate": "2012-06-20T14:16:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "68MT59916Jc", "description": "", "title": "Psychopomps \u2729 Overcasters", "publishedDate": "2013-03-27T20:45:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "68MUVgJngwk", "description": "\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e0a\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e30\u0e04\u0e4a\u0e32\u0e40\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e48\u0e07\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e30\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e19\u0e30", "title": "BusyBody Crew Cute", "publishedDate": "2013-01-23T23:54:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "68MgjYhcfOU", "description": "Dogs cannot be stopped from shedding, but the amount of hair being shed can be reduced by regular brushing to get rid of the undercoat.

But doctors in the USA put almost all patients with high cholesterol on these drugs, even though there is questionable mortality benefit. In the United Kingdom there is a proposal to put ALL men over 50 and women over 60 on statins. So what's the harm you ask? One harm is increased mortality that shows up in some studies; like cancer and suicides.

Masters began playing music while at college, eventually dropping out to become the leader of a theatre house band in Chicago, Illinois, USA. Several years later, in the late 20s, he decided to inaugurate his first dance band under his own name. His sidemen included Woody Kessler, Jerry Borchard, Steve Brown, Jay Mathews, Stuart Charles, Bill Pritchard, Kahn Keene, Vincent Ferrine, Buddy Shiffman, Carl Bean, Howard Barkell, Don Elton, Russ Dillon, Orin Crippen, Ray Noonan, Johnny Barshark, Phil Gray, Joe Reisman, Eddie Baxter, Hy Lesnick, Morty Nathan, Fred Smith, Jimmy Nash, Bill Aimesworth, Jack Wald, Bobby Lewis, Irving Trisco, Maxwell Anderson, Don Bell and Bill Johnson. The featured vocalists were Harlan Rogers, Gordon Goodman, Lou Hirst, Phyllis Miles (who later married Masters) and Marion Francis. There were also two vocal congregations: the Swing Masters and the Masters Voices. Initially taking dates in the local Chicago theatre circuit from where so many of its members were culled, the group's first professional hotel engagement came at the College Inn of the Sherman Hotel. They stayed there for nearly four years with regular remote radio broadcasts from that location. Masters became a national celebrity when 'Scatterbrain' became a major hit single, producing high profile engagements at the Pennsylvania Taft and Essex House hotels in New York. \n\nFor much more information please see:\nhttp://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Frankie-Masters.html", "title": "Scatter Brain - Frankie Masters And His Orchestra (Conqueror)", "publishedDate": "2012-09-08T18:58:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "68_U3eUDtxY", "description": "Brackets 1.0 and Extract for Brackets on Ubuntu 14.10 linux demo\n\nhttp://brackets.io/\n\nBrackets is a lightweight, yet powerful, modern text editor. \n\nExtract for Brackets is a Creative Cloud service that lets you view and get information and assets out of a PSD right from your text\neditor.

They have  colors that are stunning examples of the true \"art\" that you can find within nature. There are many varieties of Tussock Moth Caterpillars and 3 of my favorites are shown in this film. Some species like the Milkweed Tussock Moth Caterpillars are particular eaters and focus their attention towards Milkweed and Dogbane plants.  The White-Marked Tussock Moth Caterpillars will actually feed on many different species and is not picky at all. Many types feed on or near similar plants you can often find a Banded Tussock Moth Caterpillar feeding on a dogbane near Milkweed Tussock Moth Caterpillars. Some species like the Milkweed Tussock Moth Caterpillar are toxic to predators due to the plants they ingest while others like the White-Sided Tussock Moth Caterpillar, actually have the ability to cause a serious skin rash when handled so do not pick them up! Simply admire these beautiful species by gazing at them as they forage on plant matter. I'm Mark Fraser and thanks for joining me on a Nature Walk.

The Animals had their origins in a Newcastle-based group called the Kansas City Five, whose membership included pianist Alan Price, drummer John Steel, and vocalist Eric Burdon. Price exited to join the Kontours in 1962, while Burdon went off to London. The Kontours, whose membership included Bryan \"Chas\" Chandler, eventually were transmuted into the Alan Price R&B Combo, with John Steel joining on drums. Burdon's return to Newcastle in early 1963 heralded his return to the lineup. The final member of the combo, guitarist Hilton Valentine, joined just in time for the recording of a self-produced EP under the band's new name, the Animals. That record alerted Graham Bond to the Animals; he was likely responsible for pointing impresario Giorgio Gomelsky to the group.\n\nGomelsky booked the band into his Crawdaddy Club in London, and they were subsequently signed by Mickie Most, an independent producer who secured a contract with EMI's Columbia imprint. A studio session in February 1964 yielded their Columbia debut single, \"Baby Let Me Take You Home\" (adapted from \"Baby Let Me Follow You Down\"), which rose to number 21 on the British charts. For years, it was rumored incorrectly that the Animals got their next single, \"House of the Rising Sun,\" from Bob Dylan's first album, but it has been revealed that, like \"Baby Let Me Take You Home,\" the song came to them courtesy of Josh White. In any event, the song -- given a new guitar riff by Valentine and a soulful organ accompaniment devised by Price -- shot to the top of the U.K. and U.S. charts early that summer. This success led to a follow-up session that summer, yielding their first long-playing record, The Animals. Their third single, \"I'm Crying,\" rose to number eight on the British charts. The group compiled an enviable record of Top Ten successes, including \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\" and \"We've Gotta Get Out of This Place,\" along with a second album, Animal Tracks.\n\nIn May of 1965, immediately after recording \"We've Gotta Get Out of This Place,\" Alan Price left the band, citing fear of flying as the reason; subsequent biographies of the band have indicated that the reasons were less psychological. When \"House of the Rising Sun\" was recorded, using what was essentially a group arrangement, the management persuaded the band to put one person's name down as arranger. Price came up the lucky one, supposedly with the intention that the money from the arranger credit would be divided later on. The money was never divided, however, and as soon as it began rolling in, Price suddenly developed his fear of flying and exited the band. Others cite the increasing contentiousness between Burdon and Price over leadership of the group as the latter's reason for leaving. In any case, a replacement was recruited in the person of Dave Rowberry.\n\nIn the meantime, the group was growing increasingly unhappy with the material they were being given to record by manager Mickie Most. Not only were the majority of these songs much too commercial for their taste, but they represented a false image of the band, even if many were successful. \"It's My Life,\" a number seven British hit and a similar smash in America, caused the Animals to terminate their association with Most and with EMI Records. They moved over to Decca/London Records and came up with a more forceful, powerful sound on their first album for the new label, Animalisms. The lineup shifts continued, however: Steel exited in 1966, after recording Animalisms, and was replaced by Barry Jenkins, formerly of the Nashville Teens. Chandler left in mid-1966 after recording \"Don't Bring Me Down\" and Valentine remained until the end of 1966, but essentially \"Don't Bring Me Down\" marked the end of the original Animals.  ~ Bruce Eder, All Music Guide\n\nPLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Except for the central feathers, the tail is mostly black, contrasting with the paler body; this contrast is especially noticeable when the bird is in flight. The summer male has black \"horns\", which give this species its American name. America has a number of races distinguished by the face pattern and back color of males, especially in summer. The southern European mountain race Eremophila alpestris penicillata is greyer above, and the yellow of the face pattern is replaced with white.\n\nVocalizations are high-pitched, lisping or tinkling, and weak. The song, given in flight as is common among larks, consists of a few chips followed by a warbling, ascending trill.\n\nSource - Wikipedia\n\nThanks to our viewer JJ for pointing out that \"The bird appearing in this footage is actually not T. bichenovii, but it is a Horned Lark, also called Shore Lark (Eremophila alpestris).

O Inter, por sua vez, sabia da import\u00e2ncia do resultado para seguir firma na briga pela Libertadores. Desta forma, a partida na Vila Belmiro foi movimentada desde os primeiros minutos. O time da casa tinha mais presen\u00e7a no ataque, por\u00e9m falta objetividade para definir as jogadas.\n\nOs espa\u00e7os deixados pelo Santos eram bem aproveitados pelo Inter, que quase chegou ao primeiro gol logo aos oito minutos, mas Nilmar n\u00e3o alcan\u00e7ou o cruzamento rasteiro. D'Alessandro tamb\u00e9m deu trabalho aos 12, em chute de fora da \u00e1rea que obrigou boa defesa de Aranha. No lance seguinte, Robinho apareceu livre na cara do goleiro e chutou \u00e0 esquerda da meta colorada.\n\nAos 14, o Santos carimbou o travess\u00e3o com Bruno Uvini, e Gabriel chegou a balan\u00e7ar a rede. O atacante, no entanto, foi flagrado em posi\u00e7\u00e3o de impedimento. Sem marcar, o time da Vila foi castigado. Lucas Lima errou o passe no meio de campo, D'Alessandro ligou o contra-ataque, encontrou Ar\u00e1nguiz livre na \u00e1rea, o chileno levou para a perna esquerda e abriu o placar aos 24.\n\nO gol colorado n\u00e3o mudou a cara do jogo. O Internacional seguiu com a sua estrat\u00e9gia de permanecer no campo de defesa, esperando o momento certo para atacar, enquanto o Santos tinha dificuldades para chegar efetivamente com perigo. Os donos da casa ainda mostravam maior desorganiza\u00e7\u00e3o em campo, mostrando que Enderson Moreira teria trabalho nos vesti\u00e1rios para buscar a virada.\n\nO treinador alvinegro tentou dar mais qualidade ao meio de campo no segundo tempo. Renato entrou na vaga de Alison, mas a presen\u00e7a de um jogador mais experiente n\u00e3o acalmou os \u00e2nimos do time santista. Edu Dracena foi amarelado logo aos quatro minutos e Arouca, na sequ\u00eancia, cometeu falta perigosa que quase originou o segundo gol colorado.\n\nCom o passar do tempo, o Santos conseguiu se organizar. O time da casa, que j\u00e1 trabalhava a bola no meio de campo durante o primeiro tempo, passou a transformar a posse de bola em chances de gols. Aos 13, Robinho recebeu no lado esquerdo, saiu da marca\u00e7\u00e3o ao dominar no peito, invadiu a \u00e1rea com liberdade, mas errou o chute, sem levar perigo \u00e0 meta de Alisson.\n\nAbel Braga n\u00e3o escondia sua irrita\u00e7\u00e3o com a postura defensiva do Colorado. O treinador temia pelo empate, o que n\u00e3o demorou a acontecer. Aos 17, Cicinho saiu livre no lado direito, arrumou espa\u00e7o para o cruzamento, Gabriel se antecipou \u00e0 marca\u00e7\u00e3o j\u00e1 na pequena \u00e1rea e apareceu para desviar ao fundo da rede, deixando tudo igual na Vila Belmiro.\n\nO empate fez o Santos crescer na partida. O Inter j\u00e1 n\u00e3o conseguia ligar os contra-ataques e o final de jogo foi dominado pelo time da casa. Robinho recebeu de Lucas Lima, saiu na cara de Alisson, mas foi travado no momento do chute. Na sequ\u00eancia, Edu Dracena desviou de cabe\u00e7a no meio da \u00e1rea, Rildo ficou livre na pequena \u00e1rea, por\u00e9m conseguiu chutar para fora.\n\nApesar do amplo dom\u00ednio, o Santos novamente pecava no momento da finaliza\u00e7\u00e3o e acabou sendo castigado. Ao dividir uma bola na intermedi\u00e1ria, Mena jogou para tr\u00e1s, Aranha pegou com as m\u00e3os e o \u00e1rbitro marcou o recuo, para a irrita\u00e7\u00e3o dos jogadores alvinegros. Na cobran\u00e7a do tiro indireto, Ar\u00e1nguiz bateu rasteiro com for\u00e7a, o chute passou por baixo da barreira e balan\u00e7ou a rede.\n\nFICHA T\u00c9CNICA:\nSANTOS 1 X 2 INTER-RS\n\nLocal: Vila Belmiro, em Santos (SP) \nData: 2 de novembro de 2014, domingo \nHor\u00e1rio: 17 horas (hor\u00e1rio de Bras\u00edlia) \n\u00c1rbitro: Jailson Macedo Freitas (BA) \nAssistentes: Alessandro Rocha de Matos e Luiz Carlos Silva Teixeira (ambos da Bahia) \nCart\u00f5es Amarelos: Cicinho, Edu Dracena (Santos), Alisson, Alan Patrick, Fabr\u00edcio e Jorge Henrique (Internacional)\nGols:\nSANTOS: Gabriel, aos 17 minutos do segundo tempo \nINTERNACIONAL: Ar\u00e1nguiz, aos 24 minutos do primeiro tempo, e aos 35 minutos do segundo tempo\n\nSANTOS: Aranha; Cicinho, Edu Dracena, Bruno Uvini e Mena; Arouca, Alison (Renato) e Lucas Lima; Gabriel (Leandro Dami\u00e3o), Robinho e Rildo (Jorge Eduardo) \nT\u00e9cnico: Enderson Moreira\n\nINTERNACIONAL: Alisson; Cl\u00e1udio Winck, Alan Costa, Ernando e Fabr\u00edcio; Willians, Ar\u00e1nguiz, Alan Patrick (Bertotto), Jorge Henrique e D'Alessandro (Welington Paulista); Nilmar (Ygor) \nT\u00e9cnico: Abel Braga", "title": "Os Gols de Santos 1 x 2 Internacional Brasileir\u00e3o 02.11.2014", "publishedDate": "2014-11-02T21:09:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "68xnAfwgoqY", "description": "Because yes, despite the urban legend, she has a (even topspin) backhand, here are some proofs ;p\nfrom Wimbledon Final 1989 vs. Navratilova", "title": "Backhands Steffi Graf  1", "publishedDate": "2009-11-14T21:28:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "68xu7uxsAgY", "description": "Sang by Alainediema\n\nThis is beautiful if anyone knows whats this called tell me please so i can translate it. \nThanks!\n\nI don't own this song or the vocals i just had the video incase the person deleted there account.

Found in homes across the UK, the carpet beetle prefers warm environments with plenty of sources of food, such as loft spaces and bedrooms.\n \nIt can take anything between 8 months and three years for a carpet beetle to grow from egg to adult -- a figure largely dependent on the food supply within its environment.\n \nAppearance\n \u2022Carpet beetle larvae are hairy and brown, normally reaching a length of 4-5mm.\n \u2022An adult carpet beetle measures 1.5mm-4mm and is characterised by the pattern of yellow, black and whitish scales on the body.\n \nLifecycle\n \nEggs can hatch anytime between 10 to 35 days depending on the temperature, with the larvae often remaining in adolescence for over a year. Adult carpet beetles appear in April, May and June and their resulting larvae hibernate during the following winter pupating during the latter part of February and March.\n \nOn emergence the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen. After mating, the female carpet beetles enter houses during late summer and autumn and lay their eggs in birds' nests in roof voids and other suitable places.\n \nPest Control\n \nInfestations of these insects mostly originate in birds' nests such as those of house sparrow, house martin, swift and starling. The carpet beetle larvae subsist on the soiled wool and feathers in the nest-lining and then manage to get under the eaves in the roof space. From here they crawl into the upper rooms of the house, usually following the hot water pipe system.\n \nThe fully grown larvae of carpet beetles appear to be resistant to modern contact insecticides because they are able to crawl about long after they have come into contact with a lethal dose of insecticide. Perseverance and patience must be exercised in dealing with this pest as immediate results will seldom be achieved.", "title": "Carpet beetle lavae AKA woolly bears", "publishedDate": "2013-01-15T22:34:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "6900fP-y1ek", "description": "Piaget", "title": "Piaget e o Desenvolvimento", "publishedDate": "2008-05-17T20:14:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "6903zFUIxoU", "description": "Music video by Nas performing Cherry Wine (Explicit). \u00a9:  The Island Def Jam Music Group", "title": "Nas - Cherry Wine (Explicit) ft.

We're a full service audiology clinic. We have three full time doctors of audiology here. And we're here to provide all of your hearing care needs. I want to talk to you today about maybe some of the difficulties or challenges you have hearing in noisy environment or hearing family members, television, different situations where your ability to hear clearly is affected. What we want to discuss today is the new lyric that is out. This is an extended wearing hearing device that we place in your ear canal, that is very close to your ear drum. It provides exceptional sound quality. You wear it for about three months and when it dies you come  in and we'll replace it. You can shower in it. You can play tennis in it. You can just go about your daily activities and you can just hear 24/7. That's what we will call a hassle free device. One of the reasons we want you to come in now to check this out is to see if this is something that can help you with those circumstances and situations. Yes we do carry traditional hearing devices also as those were excellent to many people but the great thing about the lyric is the hassle free type of situation where you don't have to worry about changing the batteries. It's just in your ear and you can just hear all the time.  This is one of the reasons we think it's a great idea for you to come in and have a hearing evaluation. Let's evaluate you and have a lyric screening to see if this might be something that will work great for you to improve the quality of life for you.\n\nDirections and Reviews:\n\nWe are proud to offer residents of Sarasota FL the best hearing aids and audiology services.

At the time, the idea of threading a thin tube through a patient's artery toward the heart, using the body's circulatory system to clear blockages, deliver medication, and position stents was revolutionary.\n\nFor decades, the most commonly used entry point to the circulatory system for catheter-based procedures has been the femoral artery in the groin, but North Shore Medical Center and about 10 percent of medical centers throughout the country have switched to a new access point, the radial artery, located in the wrist. This innovative cardiac catheterization technique reduces recovery time and bleeding and may provide a less stressful option for patients who need the procedure.\n\nWhy are physicians switching from the femoral artery to the radial artery?\n\nThe femoral artery has been used more frequently because its large size can accommodate balloons, stents and almost any size catheter. However, the femoral artery can be difficult to access especially in overweight individuals. Stopping bleeding once the procedure has been completed requires heavy pressure at the needle insertion site, and patients need to remain in the hospital lying quietly on their backs for as long as 12 hours to ensure there is no bleeding. This can be difficult and painful for some patients, particularly elderly patients and those with hip or back pain. In some cases, there can be internal bleeding that is not immediately visible.\n\nThe radial artery in the wrist is close to the skin surface, making the needle puncture more straightforward for the cardiologist and less uncomfortable for the patient. When the procedure has been completed, a band similar to a wristwatch is placed around the wrist, which supplies pressure and prevents bleeding. Most patients are able to get up almost immediately and walk. Unlike the femoral, any bleeding from the radial artery is readily apparent.\n\nPatients who undergo this newer technique have less bruising and bleeding, fewer complications and a faster recovery overall.\n\nIs the wrist approach safe?\n\nYes. Major studies have shown that the radial artery is as successful as the femoral artery approach and has lower rates of bleeding and other complications.\n\nThe challenge is the artery near the wrist is roughly half the size of its counterpart in the groin, so increased precision and state-of-the-art technology are required to perform the procedure. The radial approach is more challenging for the physician to learn, and not as many interventional cardiologists in the U.S. have been trained in the technique as in some other countries. Those who have learned the technique tend to use it for most of their patients.\n\nAt North Shore Medical Center the radial approach is now the first choice for appropriate patients.", "title": "Radial Cardiac Catheterization at North Shore Medical Center", "publishedDate": "2012-02-13T19:58:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "698bAf0Zc1c", "description": "http://www.lax.com/ - In the battle for the 2014 Texas High School Division One lacrosse state championship, the Episcopal School of Dallas faced off against Dallas Jesuit.

At Ocean Seven Foam Roofing we are Newport Beach Foam Insulation and Roofing Experts we do residential, industrial and commercial foam roofing and insulation. Free Estimates.\n\nInsulation and roofing are very important parts of your home, and spray foam is an ideal alternative to traditional insulation and roofing. Spray foam is also a way to repair or improve many issues within your home. It is an excellent application for tanks, freezers, coolers, piping, duct-work, as well as odd jobs. Spray foam is the future of insulation in all areas of your home including attics and walls -- but it must be done properly.\n\nFoam roof insulation is a polyurethane foam product which is applied directly onto the existing roof of your house/building. Because foam roofing is liquid polyurethane, it spreads easily onto, and adheres permanently to any surface, including concrete, metal and asphalt. Foam roofing will help reduce the costs of roof replacement by preserving an existing roof design. While foam roofing is durable and long lasting, the application process is delicate and must be done by a qualified, highly-trained, roofing expert.\n\nSpray foam is a cost effective alternative, and a sustainable option that gives years and years of wear and tear to your roof. Spray foam is a complete barrier to air, moisture and pollutants, and is watertight within 30 seconds of application, offering complete protection to every room in your home. Spray foam can be applied to flat, pitched, saw-toothed and domed roofs, as well as roofs having unusual slopes or configurations. Because spray foam is so effective at solving these generally difficult roofing issues, it allows your roof to be applied with a minimum of inconvenience, mess and disruption to you.\n\nOcean Seven Roofing are the Southern California spray foam specialists. Their expertise can help you resolve any roofing or insulation issue, and provide comfort and peace of mind for years to come.\n\nDon't wait Call us today (949) 340-2077 and we guarantee to beat ANY competitors bid, or press here to get free quote now.\n\nAt Ocean Seven Roofing and Building we use green and energy efficient products.

Heimlich's tendency to overeat is the theme of the ride, as the train appears to eat through oversized portions of human foods: candy corn, animal crackers, carrots, Brussels sprouts and watermelon. Appropriate scents accompany the giant food sets so guests can sniff to attract them. Large bites have been taken out of all the foods, so guests can tell that Heimlich has been there before.

Although it was designed and tested with students in fourth grade, our team of educators discovered that students in higher grades (even high school and college) benefited from the review of writing tools and how to effectively integrate all of them into a writing passage.\n\nWe have included a special bonus section: Marko shows you how to proofread your work, and he reveals secrets to score well on multiple-choice writing tests. Students learn to proof for errors involving paragraphs, quotes, incomplete sentences, subject-verb agreement, misspelled words, punctuation, and more.\n\n\"This product really explains, in a visual way, story elements such as sequencing, a hook, transition, colorful words, and more.

In each instance, he explains the tool, gives an example of how it works, and then asks the girl to try to incorporate it in her story. Marko explains brainstorming, identifying the audience, finding a hook, and organizing ideas. He suggests using language rich with dialogue, colorful words, similes, onomatopoeia, and ending with a lasting impression. The first part of the program deals with writing content, and the second segment covers proofreading by using writing samples and a multiple choice format to find mistakes.

In 1996 coronary artery disease was responsible for 24% of all male deaths in England in the over-65 age group, with strokes and other circulatory disease bringing the total death rate to 33%. Women are slightly less at risk but here too the figures are dispiriting, with heart disease causing 21% of all deaths.\n\nThe UK statistics, already the worst in the world, are due to get worse  in line with the increasing figures for obesity and diabetes. For example, Irish and Scots men are three times more likely to die of coronary artery disease than their French counterparts, and their wives are nine times more likely to die in this way than their French sisters. This is the well-known French Paradox.\n\nIt certainly does seem unfair that the French, with their full fat cheeses and their pestilential Gauloises and Gitanes, should enjoy such immunity. The reasons for this immunity are becoming progressively clearer, and are everything to do with the French lifestyle  and especially their diet. Its not any one individual item on the menu but a heart-healthy combination of fresh fruits and vegetables, olive oil, red wine, dark chocolate and black coffee  and the nutrients in them.\n\nOf course, there are always Big Pharmas drugs  and plenty to choose from! In the pre-heart attack phase there are drugs to lower cholesterol, drugs to lower blood pressure and drugs to make blood platelets less sticky.\n\nmore info from\nhttp://www.drpaulclayton.com", "title": "Heart Disease Treatment without Drugs or Surgery", "publishedDate": "2008-10-27T18:00:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "69RRvUi_ynk", "description": "Taken from 22 Jump Street.", "title": "Sony / Columbia Pictures / Metro Goldwyn Mayer / Original Film", "publishedDate": "2014-09-27T19:12:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "69SM4HHOE8o", "description": "\u00b0\u00b0 WATCH IN HD \u00b0\u00b0\n-------------------------------\nSuggestions:\n- Jewelry (girl) \n- Candle (girl)\n- Home Depot/Lowes Gift Card (guy)\n- Coffee\n- Coffee Mug\n- Coffee Shop Gift Cards\n- Staples Gift Cards\n-------------------------------\n\u00b0\u00b0 Want to Send Me Something? \u00b0\u00b0\n\nDIY Creativity\nPO Box 1321\nScarborough, ME\n04070\n\n**All mail received will be featured in \"PO Box Hauls\" on my 2nd channel**\n-------------------------------\n\u00b0\u00b0 Follow Me Here \u00b0\u00b0\n\n2nd Channel \u2192 https://www.youtube.com/user/DIYCreativityTake2\nGoogle+ \u2192 www.plus.google.com/+DIYCreativity_Alexa\nTwitter \u2192 @DIY_Creativity\nInstagram \u2192 @diy_creativity_yt\nFacebook \u2192 www.facebook.com/DoItYourselfCreativity\nWebsite \u2192 www.doityourselfcreativity.com\n-------------------------------\n\u00b0\u00b0 MUSIC \u00b0\u00b0\n-------------------------------\nDisclaimer:  I am not being sponsored to do this video.

\nJust a glance and you took me\nThere in a heartbeat\nI was in the dark and you found me\nCrawling at your feet\nI couldn't get out\nYou see, you got me\n\nYou got me hostage, hostage\nBut there's no need for holding, holding\nYou got me hostage, hostage\nBut you know I wanted you to hold me\n\nV2 - \nI spent so much time pretending\nPointing fingers at you\nIn denial, it's so easy\nBlame the pain on somebody who knew\n\nYou knew just how to save me \nBut you didn't now, did you now\nInstead you took me by the heartstrings\nAnd I let you tear it out \n\nPRE\n\nCHORUS\n\nBRIDGE - \nAnd if you hold me down I'm not a fighter\nBut if you could let me down slow\nI don't plan on fighting this flame with fire\nI just need you to let me go", "title": "\"Hostage\" by Katy McAllister -

What I mean by that is that 99.9% of the public have no idea what a prosthodontist does. Most of the patients that present to me are referred to me from general dentists or another dental specialists because they are struggling with their teeth.\n\nWhen a patient comes in and I say to them, \"Do you know what a prosthodontist is,\" they really have no idea. They say, \"I don't know. I'm just here because I'm having a lot of problems.\"\n\nNow prosthodontists are very highly-trained in precision, meaning that they would look at things very differently from how a regular dentist might look at them. There are some fantastic general dentists out there who are very highly-skilled. I work with a lot of them.\n\nThe difference a prosthodontist brings to the team -- I look at the prosthodontist as the quarterback of the team. The prosthodontist plans the care, essentially is responsible for the end result, is responsible for the cosmetics, is responsible for the longevity. Really is responsible for troubleshooting all of the patient's dental problems.\n\n3 years of full-time training, 15 hours a day, 7 days a week is a lot of training. I would submit to you that even at the end of that training, we still do not know enough. With that in mind, we still try to learn every day and improve on ourselves and take many continuing education courses.\n\nFrom a simple perspective, what does a prosthodontist look at? Say you were to go to a dentist's office and they were going to do a single crown. The dentist may look at your gums, he may look at the shape of the tooth, and they would probably prepare the tooth, make an impression and send it to the lab to make a crown.\n\nNow the difference the prosthodontist would do is that they would look at the levels of your gums. They will look at the shape of the tooth, the texture of the tooth, the translucency of the tooth. How much tooth do you have available? Are there any techniques that we can use that are minimally invasive.\n\nThe laboratories would be different. A huge factor in the end result is the laboratory technician. As a prosthodontist, we have to be able to work with very highly-skilled people to be able to deliver results which exceed your expectations.\n\nSo a prosthodontist would look at many more things than a regular dentist when planning your care.", "title": "What is a Prosthodontist - Dr. Saj Jivraj - Prosthodontist in Ventura County, California", "publishedDate": "2013-07-31T21:06:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "69dFZwhUu9A", "description": "Music Video by HI-FI performing B\u0105d\u017a Ze Mn\u0105 B\u0105d\u017a (C) 2014 Wydawnictwo Muzyczne POPARAZZI.\n\nUstaw utw\u00f3r B\u0104D\u0179 ZE MN\u0104 B\u0104D\u0179 zespo\u0142u HI-FI zamiast sygna\u0142u oczekiwania na po\u0142\u0105czenie.\n \nWy\u015blij HIFI1 na numer 80833 (0 z\u0142)\n\nAbonament:\nMuzyka na Czekanie (Play) -- 2z\u0142 z VAT,\nCzasoumilacz (Plus) -- 2,02z\u0142 z VAT,\nGranie na Czekanie Bez Limitu (T-Mobile) -- 4,99z\u0142 z VAT,  \nHalo Granie Bez Limitu (Orange) -- 4z\u0142 z VAT \n(techniczne utrzymanie us\u0142ugi 2z\u0142, dost\u0119p do utwor\u00f3w 2z\u0142), \nreg. halodzwonek.pl\n\nLegalnie i bez stresu \u015bci\u0105gaj utw\u00f3r \"B\u0104D\u0179 ZE MN\u0104 B\u0104D\u0179\" z serwisu :\n- MUZODAJNIA.PL : http://www1.plus.pl/muzodajnia/main/album.html?albumId=550670&artistId=603224&t=Hi+Fi%2BBadz+ze+mna+badz\n- ITUNES :https://itunes.apple.com/pl/album/badz-ze-mna-badz-single/id828984357\nPrzekonaj si\u0119 i sprawd\u017a to ju\u017c teraz...\n\nWi\u0119cej info:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/zespolhifi\n(Oficjalny Fun Page zespo\u0142u HI-FI)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MuzycznaPrem...\n(Oficjalny Fun Page Wydawnictwa POPARAZZI)\n\n\"B\u0105d\u017a Ze Mn\u0105 B\u0105d\u017a\"\nMuzyka i S\u0142owa : Krzysztof Tatarczuk\n\nNie wiedzia\u0142em czy w\u0142a\u015bnie ty\nspe\u0142nisz moje marzenia i sny\nNie wiedzia\u0142em, \u017ce strza\u0142a amora\ndopadnie mnie, o, o, o, o!\n\nPoca\u0142unek zauroczy\u0142,\ntwe spojrzenie i warkoczyk\ncudne cia\u0142o, u\u015bmiech ten\nco powali\u0142 mnie.\n\nREFREN: B\u0105d\u017a ze mn\u0105 b\u0105d\u017a,\nnajs\u0142odsze me kochanie\nb\u0105d\u017a przy mnie b\u0105d\u017a, o, o, o!\nB\u0105d\u017a przy mnie b\u0105d\u017a\ni niech ju\u017c tak zostanie\nb\u0105d\u017a ze mn\u0105 b\u0105d\u017a na zawsze ju\u017c.\n\nREFREN: B\u0105d\u017a ze mn\u0105 b\u0105d\u017a...\n\nTeraz wiem, \u017ce ty, w\u0142a\u015bnie ty\nspe\u0142nisz moje marzenia i sny.\nMia\u0142em szcz\u0119\u015bcie, \u017ce amor\nupolowa\u0142 mnie, o, o, o, o!\n\nPoca\u0142unek zauroczy\u0142,\ntwe spojrzenie i warkoczyk\ncudne cia\u0142o, u\u015bmiech ten\nco powali\u0142 mnie.\n\nREFREN: B\u0105d\u017a ze mn\u0105 b\u0105d\u017a... |2x\n\nB\u0105d\u017a ze mn\u0105 b\u0105d\u017a, o, o, o!\nb\u0105d\u017a przy mnie b\u0105d\u017a, o, o, o!\nB\u0105d\u017a przy mnie b\u0105d\u017a, o, o, o!\nb\u0105d\u017a ze mn\u0105 b\u0105d\u017a, na zawsze ju\u017c.\n\nREFREN: B\u0105d\u017a ze mn\u0105 b\u0105d\u017a...", "title": "HI-FI - B\u0104D\u0179 ZE MN\u0104 B\u0104D\u0179 /Oficjalny Teledysk/ DISCO POLO NOWO\u015a\u0106 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-02-14T10:48:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "69ddSe7mnzs", "description": "Just a short battle featuring my new Moxie Salmence! :D\nThanks to ThePokeFlare for this teaching me this technique! :D\nhttp://www.youtube.com/ThePokeFlare", "title": "Pokemon Black & White Wi-Fi Battle #3: Moxie Salamence!", "publishedDate": "2012-07-26T15:26:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "69dmjX68rgQ", "description": "Trick or treat, Dragoknights?

Gengar, while being a dope, fly, badassed motherfucker also had a heart that was as big as it's head which was unusually large, sort of like a bobble head. Gengar the Gengar who was a badass gave Ghastly gassy dance lessons and Ghastly evolved into a Haunter and the true meaning of Halloween was revealed in ten minutes when the Haunter-Gengar Crew was brutally slaughtered by Giratina who owned the hood, and was like, \"Trick or treat, motha-fucka.\" and then did like, a dramatic action movie stare at the screen thing that makes everyone a bit uncomfortable, but for some reason is badass too.

Nobody suspected a thing.\n\nEvery day a new audience added TinnyVision on Snapchat. Over the course of that day they watched the guys get stoned and their reactions get slower. Ten video snaps later, the guys decide to go for a drive. A girl walks out. The driver is too slow to react. He hits her. She hits the windscreen.\n\nImagine that.

But how do these differences translate into brain activity?

It was first known in the 17th century, later it became a dangerous devil to human life.\n\nAgain Diabetes is differentiated in to two types\u2019 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Diabetes mellitus is mainly caused by deficiency of insulin due to either lack of energy in pancreas (or) any auto-immune disease. While diabetes insipidus is caused by defect in secretion of vasopressin (Antidiuretic hormone) which is secreted from pituitary gland present in hypothalamus.  Its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the kidney and due to this it control the concentration of urine. But its deficiency caused increased water excretion through urine even in low intake of water.\n\nDiabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are unrelated, although they have similar signs and symptoms like excessive thirst and excessive urination. Diabetes mellitus is more common than the Diabetes insipidus. \n\nDIABETES MELLITUS:  There are mainly three types of Diabetes mellitus.\n\nTYPE 1 DIABETES: The body does not produce insulin due to dis-function of pancreas. Such diabetes called as insulin dependent diabetes. People usually develop type-1 diabetes before their 40th year often in early adulthood (or) teenage years.\n\nToday type 1 diabetes has no proper treatment in all over the world.  So these individuals are insulin dependent to rest of their life. Approximately 23 % of all diabetes cases are type 1.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\u00fc Unusual weight loss.\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Increased urination (sometimes as often as every hour).\n\u00fc Nausea perhaps vomiting.\n\u00fc Blurred vision.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Dry mouth.\n\u00fc Itching skin.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nTYPE 2 DIABETES:  Globally as of 2013 an estimated 382 million people have type 2 diabetes worldwide. About 90% cases are type 2 diabetes. This is happening due to lack of energy in the pancreas. So that pancreas cannot produce sufficient insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in our body.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES: \n\u00fc Unusual weight loss (or) gain.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Excessive hungry.\n\u00fc Weak eye sight.\n\u00fc Increased urination (especially during night times).\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nGESTATION DIABETES: This type of diabetes usually occurs in pregnant mothers during gestation (pregnancy) period. So there is an increase in high blood sugar in pregnant mother. Most gestational diabetes goes away after child birth, but it does put you at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF GESTATION DIABETES: \n\u00fc Increased urination\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness\n\u00fc Increased thirst\n\u00fc Nausea and vomiting\n\u00fc Blurred vision\n\u00fc Weight loss\n\u00fc Hormonal imbalance\n\u00fc Head aches\n\u00fc Body pain \n\nDIABETES INSIPIDUS: The several forms of diabetes insipidus are:\n\nNEUROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:  Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is more commonly known as central diabetes insipidus. It is caused by the damage of pituitary gland present in hypothalamus region (or) other reasons like autoimmune, infection, surgery, head trauma, and some drugs.\n\nNEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:   Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an improper response of the kidney to ADH, leading to a decrease in     the ability of kidney to concentrate the urine by removing free water.\n\nDIPSOGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:    Dipsogenic diabetes insipidus is defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus. This defect results in the inability for water deficit to trigger vasopressin secretion and thirst. Such patients tend to develop hypernatermia and dehydration without seeking water to drink.\n\nNadipathy:\nNadipathy introduced new treatment to all diabetes without using any medicines. It is the natural treatment, that re-strength the pancreas to produce insulin in our body. We are using 100 ancient therapies to enhance the pancreas function normally. Nadipathy treated the subtle body; it will make physical body healthy. \n\nRead More:\nBlog: http://diabetestreatmentinnadipathy.blogspot.in/\n\nYou tube:   http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYxb4HnTMmGJUTHnGsYbafwN-IwYyNFP", "title": "Sugar(Diabetes) cured in 3 days by nadipathy treatment", "publishedDate": "2014-08-25T13:35:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "6A0ZbBg63Fo", "description": "Deepika Padukone is the lady of the moment, and with the spotlight on her at all time Miss Padukone makes sure, she is at her diplomatic best!
