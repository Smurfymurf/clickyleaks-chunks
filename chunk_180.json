Responding to a report of underaged drinking, Boone County Sheriff's Deputies arrived in force to surround a party taking place on a rural road in Hebron, Kentucky.\n\nThe teens scrambled to escape as the government agents came in to arrest them.  One girl, 19-year-old Samantha Ramsey, had made her way to the drivers' seat of her car.\n\nDashcam video from a police cruiser depicted the moment Ms. Ramsey, a preschool teacher, tried to escape.  As her white car pulled onto the street, the teen passed Boone County Sheriff's Deputy Tyler Brockman, who can be seen clearly standing to the side of her vehicle on the driver's side.\n\nIntent on imprisoning the girl for her beverage consumption, Deputy Brockman confronted the girl and tried to position himself in the forward trajectory of the vehicle.  \n\nThe vehicle slid out of view just as the deputy closed in on the driver's window; Ms. Ramsey had not stopped her vehicle.  The confrontation ended as Deputy Brockman fired four shots through the windshield, fatally striking the teen.\n\nThe shooting itself occurred off-camera but several of the young partygoers were filmed reacting hysterically to bloody encounter; flailing arms and crying.  The victim's car ended up in a ditch and a cloud of smoke billowed forth, along with a passenger who stumbled out and collapsed onto the road.\n\nDeputy Brockman claimed that Ms. Ramsey tried to run him over and that he was the victim.", "title": "Kentucky cops raid teenagers' field party, kill girl who tried to escape", "publishedDate": "2014-11-12T20:23:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "ALYXAVQsHV8", "description": "", "title": "SERAFIN - LETHARGY", "publishedDate": "2010-02-21T11:50:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "ALYbMz2yvJI", "description": "Joel Compass - Girlfriends, Joel Compass - Girlfriends, Joel Compass - Girlfriends, Joel Compass - Girlfriends, Joel Compass - Girlfriends, Joel Compass - Girlfriends, Joel Compass - Girlfriends, Joel Compass - Girlfriends, Joel Compass - Girlfriends, Joel Compass - Girlfriends, Joel Compass - Girlfriends", "title": "Joel Compass - Girlfriends (CDQ)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-01T04:28:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "ALYcF8_21Cw", "description": "I hope you enjoy this video or at least not regret the 3 minutes it took to watch it...LOL\n\nI used the following products;\n1.

This video was made for the Australian TV show Hungry Beast http://hungrybeast.abc.net.au/media/clean-feed-clash-perceptions\n\n\"Cleanfeed: The Clash of Perceptions\"\nWritten and presented by Sean Elliott\n\nThe government is planning a mandatary filter for the internet. Now, there are a lot of arguments for and against this idea. But once you get past these and step back a little bit, it seems to be that this is an argument between two different generations -- about their competing perceptions about what the internet actually is.\n\nNow one side seems to be the generation that, for when they were growing up, the idea of personal computers was something a long way off; or maybe something that was happening around them at the time. Now this group of people came to the internet later on in life -- usually for work purposes. We'll call these people 'internet immigrants'.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the generation who grew up with computers, who get a little surprised when they hear about the time that the internet didn't exist. Now for these group, the technology is so enmeshed with their life that they no longer actually see it as technology. That they see it as the way that they conduct their own lives. This group we'll call 'internet natives'.\n\nThe debate over the clean feed is essentially between internet immigrants and internet natives, and their perceptions of what the internet actually is.\n\nNow for internet immigrants, the internet is just nothing but another media source. And they know what media sources are. They're things like television and books and radio and CDs and DVDs and 8-track tapes. Now in Australia we have an office for classification which decides what can be viewed in Australia and how it should be rated. And if the internet is just another media source then it, too, should be put up for classification -- and in some cases even censored.\n\nFor internet natives, they see it as a completely different beast. They see the internet as more like a street. And like a street, there are different houses. And inside the different houses we have different rooms. And in those rooms we've got bits of content. Over there, there's the Facebook house, and down there is a house where we can buy foreign music. Now if we're going to classify the internet, do we go into each house and classify each item? Or, if we find something that we don't like, do we ban the house outright?\n\nNow here's the thing: The government is very keen to get their filter into place. And I believe it will happen. However, at some point in the not-too-distant future, more internet natives are going to find themselves in decision-making positions. So the question in my mind is: Will the clean feed survive the future?", "title": "Clean Feed: The Clash of Perceptions", "publishedDate": "2012-02-21T03:46:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "ALwDK7oS750", "description": "Plate tectonic and building of mountains.", "title": "Plate tectonic & Mountain", "publishedDate": "2008-06-08T14:44:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "ALwTdUgmmgg", "description": "Bel\u00e9n Mart\u00edn ha iniciado una huelga de hambre indefinida en la puerta del hospital madrile\u00f1o Ram\u00f3n y Cajal para exigir al Gobierno que le proporcione a su marido los medicamentos necesarios para la Hepatitis C, que deb\u00eda haber recibido a principios de octubre, ya que se encuentra en la \u00faltima fase de la enfermedad, antes de meterle en lista de espera para un trasplante de h\u00edgado.\n\n\nVisto en: http://www.youtube.com/europapress", "title": "En huelga de hambre para reclamar cura Hepatitis C", "publishedDate": "2014-11-15T17:06:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "ALwevq618ew", "description": "facet leje babe po pysku na weselu", "title": "facet leje babe po pysku", "publishedDate": "2008-06-14T22:38:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "ALwiMdKYVEA", "description": "Phi Nhung \"Th\u01b0\u01a1ng \u00c1o B\u00e0 Ba\"._.

The event will have four tracks of various distances: 5K, 10K, 20K and a half-mile track for children under 8. There will be more than 20 obstacles overall. These will include cargo nets, mud pits, rope walls, slip and slides and a monkey-bar obstacle over a swimming pool. \n\nForeman says the event is intended to be fun.

UN Environment Programme: 200 Species Extinct Every Day, Unlike Anything Since Dinosaurs Disappeared 65 Million Years Ago. According to the UN Environment Programme, the Earth is in the midst of a mass extinction of life. Scientists estimate that 150-200 species of plant, insect, bird and mammal become extinct every 24 hours. This is nearly 1,000 times the \"natural\" or \"background\" rate and, say many biologists, is greater than anything the world has experienced since the vanishing of the dinosaurs nearly 65m years ago.\nyoutube.com/watch?v=FDoW8sJ7HMI&list=PLZj_5Tu8X_uiGu6AqjmrRgt6tijt10LWo&index=8\n\n\nWEATHER EXPERT SCOTT STEVENS - A WORLD IN DENIAL \nyoutube.com/watch?v=dTFeCbeujtM&list=PLZj_5Tu8X_uiGu6AqjmrRgt6tijt10LWo&index=14", "title": "CHEMTRAILED-GEOENGINEERED WEATHER APRIL 18- U.S.GOVERNMENT CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY", "publishedDate": "2013-04-19T01:51:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "AM31i7554zE", "description": "From the Album:\nAthol McCoy - Your Tassie Mate - The Complete Masters\nTrack 11\n\n1925 -- Born August 16, Sheffield  Tasmania.\n\n1930s - Athol achieved the international record for a bargain priced guitar for 5 shillings.  Other artists paid 2 pounds 30 shillings. Then again it was not a spruced-backed, maple-necked piece of craftsmanship -- it was a beat up old box!   \n\n1935 -- Age 10, Athol was playing piano at local dances. When he left school he worked on his father's farm and then as a farmhand on neighbouring properties. It was the guitar, the Tex Morton and Wilf Carter music that claimed his attention.\n\n1947 -- Age 22, his first break came when he was asked to sing on a radio program on 7AD Devonport. The program was on Tuesday nights and ran for three and a quarter years.\n\n1950 -- Moved to  Melbourne to expand his range of opportunities.  Won his heat of  Australia's Amateur Hour in 1950 and recorded for EMI.\n\n1951 -- Won the novelty section on the 'prestigious' radio show  P & A Parade.\n\nThis win brought him fairly constant work in radio and live performances but not a great deal of progress.\n\n1951-1958 -- He worked as a barman in Connell's  Railway Hotel.\n\n1956 -- He topped the poll on Terry Dear's  Australia's  Amateur Hour with over 10,000 votes.\n\nOn the strength of that success, he went to  Sydney for an audition with Regal Zonophone and was accepted. The first track he recorded Wilf Carter's 'Swiss Moonlight Lullaby' and his own composition 'Tassie Tears'. The recordings made him the first Tasmanian to sing from the magic grooves! Sales warranted more records.\n\n1956 & 1958 -- Puts down 4 additional tracks each year.\n\nAn outcome of the recording contract was an offer of a promotional tour of eastern states on Noel George's 'Australian Wild West Show'. The show also featured American Indian Wrestler Big Chief Little Wolf. Other tours for Athol at this time were also with the 'Reg Lindsay Show, Chad Morgan and Rick and Thel Shows'.\n\n1961 -- By the time he organised his own travelling show the best days for this type of entertainment had passed on the mainland. They were hard times for travelling shows. Nearly all the shows went bust. Athol headed back to  Tasmania.\n\n1966 -- Athol toured full time again.  He teamed up with his boyhood idol 'Tex Morton' with a show called The Morton's and McCoy's\n\nThe tour started in Morven QLD, through to the Isa, across to Alice Springs, back through the settlements to  Darwin where they did a three-week season showing nightly, across the  Kimberley's down to  Western Australia and across the Nullarbor.\n\nAfter the  Tex shows ended, he toured with Terry Gordon, Ray Haselar Lindsay Butler and others.\n\nBack in  Sydney he recorded for RCA with Eileen Wood on fiddle who also toured with him and then became Mrs Athol McCoy\".\n\n1969 -- At the end of the year, he had a break from touring and gained a job with the Reserve Bank in  Melbourne.\n\n1972-1973 -- He made his last tour of  Australia.\n\n1973 -- Hadley Records in  Tamworth acquired the rights to most of Athol's recorded output and issued an album of his work.\n\nAthol and Eileen settled in Bega NSW and had their own business.  They also worked clubs occasionally as the 'Real McCoy's' duo.\n\n1980 -- Inducted into the  Hands of Fame in  Tamworth.\n\n1996 -- June 6 Athol passed away in  Bega Hospital.\n\n2005 -- Inducted to the Australian Country Music Roll of Renown.", "title": "Athol McCoy - New Tassie Waltz", "publishedDate": "2013-02-28T08:27:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "AM3BNO5d-Mc", "description": "Live at Shacklewell Arms - 31st January 2013 - 31.01.13\n\n(UK)\n\n(Artist reserves all rights, no copyright infringement intended)", "title": "Polly Scattergood - Untitled 27 (HD) - Shacklewell Arms - 31.01.13", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T20:50:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "AM3MxTCbos0", "description": "", "title": "Ba\u0301nh \u0111a cua Hai phong  crap soup noodle Vietnamese street food", "publishedDate": "2014-05-11T23:46:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "AM3SEjFI0RQ", "description": "NHL Network Top 5 Plays from around the league.", "title": "NHL Top 5 Plays from 10/24/2014", "publishedDate": "2014-10-25T11:58:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "AM3bMoi4pWc", "description": "Hello everyone and welcome to a new series on aquarium plants which are considered easy to keep and therefore suitable for beginners.

Carbon dating techniques have found tree ferns can be dated back to the Jurassic period. The plants are unique instead of having a woody stem covered in a protective bark the trunks of tree ferns are composed of rhizomes modified to grow vertically and covered with a dense miss-mash of roots. These trunks may reach heights of 20 metres (65 feet) or more in species such as Cyathea brownii . At the top of the trunk there is a growing tip which produces a cluster of often highly divided fronds that can be several metres in length. The fronds act as leaves and help the plant perform photosynthesis", "title": "Taiwan--\u6a39\u8568--Tree fern..\u690d\u7269\u754c.\u8568\u985e\u690d\u7269\u9580--\u6a39\u8568.\u7b46\u7b52\u6a39..", "publishedDate": "2013-03-10T04:02:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "AM8RCMLA9ss", "description": "Karmin Live 2013, tickets: http://www.karminmusic.com/us/events\n\nWelcome to the new living room, haha!

Subsequently, this has put a lot of pressure on IT Managers to demonstrate to their clients the ROI, TCO, and economic value of their systems and services\nIT projects that were easily approved by mid-level managers in the past, are now only approved in many companies by senior executives, often the CEO himself. This means that the approach to buying IT has changed: Companies are no longer buying \"bits and bytes\" --and vendors are forced to sell economic value. Even successful IT providers, where in the past managers used to believe that ROI and economic value assessment was not a necessity in selling their solutions, have found themselves with the need to sell ROI and economic value.   \nToday, new technology initiatives in most companies are not approved unless executive buyers see an acceptable and clear ROI.\nMost IT managers are aware of the need to use ROI in their selling or buying process; however, while some welcome the opportunity to assess and discuss ROI, others are not comfortable with the subject and do not like to spend time in linking their technology projects to economic value and ROI. The reasons vary, but generally, the top reasons are: People don't want to change the way they do things\u2014if they have been successful until now, why change?  Others are afraid\u2014they are just not comfortable with economic and financial terms.  Others do not want to be accountable for operational improvements beyond technical areas.\nWhat does all of these mean for IT Managers? We need to have the skills and tools to link technology to ROI in an objective and effective manner, or we will be left behind. Forecasting, comparing, and measuring ROI is now an integral part of the IT world, and it is no longer just about bits-and-bytes\u2014technology features and capabilities are and will always be very important, but so will understanding the impact in business operations and the impact on the bottom line.\nTrapezium Egypt helps customers assess the value of technology solutions and services by giving them the methodology, training, advisory and software tools they need to effectively assess risk and economic value.

No injuries were immediately reported.\nPresident Nicolas Maduro had sought to dampen protesters' spirits by declaring a seven-day holiday weekend coinciding with Carnival and historical commemorations and by promoting the Sunday sale of subsidized food at government-run markets.\n\"Happiness will conquer the embittered,\" Maduro said in a TV appearance at a recreation center. \"The Venezuelan people have won because happiness and peace have conquered.\"\nWhether they headed for balmy beaches or joined the barricades in anti-government protests, many people are fed up with crippling inflation, shortages of food stuffs and medicine, unchecked violent crime and government mismanagement of the economy in a nation with the world's largest proven oil reserves.\nHundreds queued up at one central Caracas market, an increasingly common sight across the country, where coffee, flour, cooking oil, toilet paper and other staples have been in short supply for a year. Longer lines have been seen at such markets in the provinces.\nThe unrest is Venezuela's worst since President Hugo Chavez died of cancer a year ago and the opposition came within a hair of winning the presidency in April's election, but it remains to be seen if it will spread to include the lower classes who benefited from Chavez's generous social welfare programs.\nMost of the marchers on Sunday, whether students or their gray-haired elders clad in white shirts and wearing hats with the Venezuelan flag's colors, hailed from the upper classes. But there were some from poorer sectors.\nOne marcher from the poor district of Catia said many people there had been intimidated into silence by pro-government militias but are now beginning to join the protests. \"People there are starting to wake up.

Esta especie es inconfundible en el Hemisferio Norte gracias a su enorme pico con forma de esp\u00e1tula. Tiene un tama\u00f1o peque\u00f1o, de unos 50 cent\u00edmetros. El macho reproductor tiene el pico negro, la cabeza de color verde botella oscuro, muy brillante, el pecho blanco y los costados y el vientre casta\u00f1os. En vuelo se aprecia el azul p\u00e1lido de las plumas cobertoras alares y el amplio espejuelo verde brillante ribeteado de blanco.\nLas hembras son de color pardo claro, con un plumaje parecido al de la hembra de \u00c1nade azul\u00f3n, pero su gran pico pardo oscuro o marr\u00f3n, con la misma forma que el del macho, las identifica f\u00e1cilmente. Los inmaduros y los machos en eclipse (no reproductores) se parecen a las hembras. Su h\u00e1bitat son las aguas continentales: marismas, charcas, lagunas, embalses, albuferas. Para alimentarse nada despacio en aguas someras y chapotea continuamente. Mantiene el pico en el agua casi horizontal y lo mueve de un lado a otro. As\u00ed filtra el agua y el limo, reteniendo plancton, insectos y semillas de los que se alimenta.\nEl nido es una depresi\u00f3n profunda en el suelo seco cercano al agua, que la hembra rellena con hierba y plum\u00f3n.\nEs una especie bastante silenciosa.

In West and East Africa the plant is used as a medicinal plant.It is a common herb growing up to 75 cm tall with ovate leaves. Flowers are green, unisexual found in catkin inflorescence. In West Africa the leaves are cooked and eaten as a vegetable. It is also browsed by cattle. This plant is held in high esteem in traditional Tamil Siddha medicine as it is believed to rejuvenate the body\nLeaves are mostly used in the form of powder or decoction.\nLeaves are mixed with garlic and are used as anthelmintic in worms and applied to scabies. The juice mixed with oil forms is used as an applica-tion in rheumatic arthritis.\nExpressed juice of the leaves is a safe, certain and speedy emetic for chil-dren in one teaspoonful doses in cases of croup. In smaller doses it is an expectorant (a medication that helps bring up mucus and other material from the lungs, bronchi and trachea) and is useful in chronic bronchitis and asthma. The decoction is employed in ear-ache as instillation and also as fomentation round the aching ear . Also cataplasm of the bruised leaves is applied to syphilitic ulcers, to maggot-eaten sores and also to relieve the pain of snakebites.\nPowder of dry leaves is used in bed sores. In congestive headache, a piece of cotton saturated with the expressed juice of the plant or leaves and inserted into each nostril is said to relieve it by causing hemorrhage from the nose.\nIn cases of obstinate constipation of children, the paste of leaves made into a ball and introduced into the rectum, relaxes the sphincter and produces free motions.

Thanks to its compact size, most of the states natural beauty spots are within relatively easy reach. \nTasmania is a unique and beautiful island to explore.

Hall and Sabu, who teamed with Montez on numerous occasions, are on hand to save the good queen.\n\nLaughable jungle plot is given a highly stylized, colorful presentation by talented director Siodmak who created some of the best film noir of the 1940s and 1950s before returning to his native Germany where he continued to direct until his death in 1973.\n\nThis is the first role of Montez as a femme fatale. The movie exposes that the secret of her inexplicable impact to the public was the enormous conviction she was acting with, which supplied her lack of dramatic resources.\n\n\"Critics are writers. They like writing - and written characters. Maria Montez's appeal was on a purely intuitive level. She was the bane of critics - that person whose effect cannot be known by words, described by words, flaunts words (her image spoke). Film critics are writers and they are hostile and uneasy in the presence of a visual phenomenon. They are most delighted by bare images that through visual bareness call thought into play to fill the visual gap. (...) A spectacular, flaming image - since it threatens their critic-hood need to be able to write - is bad and they attack it throwing in moral extensions and hinting at idiocy in whoever is capable of visually appreciating a visual medium\" (page 28-29). (From the book J. Hoberman curated with Jack Smith's writings).\n\nThis dual role, the writers Gene Lewis and Richard Brooks created for Maria in COBRA WOMAN will, would be repeated by the movie producers with big stars as: Bette Davis (A Stolen Life, Warner Bros 1946), Olivia Haviland (Dark Mirror, Universal 1946) and Bonita Granville (The Guilty, Monograma 1947)\n\n\n\nThe critic Bill Feret was the first one in consider this film as a classic in its genre. Rex Reed, another famous north-american critic, has mentioned constantly the name of Maria Montez to his readers due to his frequent comments of this movie.\n\nCharles Ludlan made a parody of the movie and the famous writer Gore Vidal was inspired in this film and in SIREN OF ATLANTIS for writing MAYRA BREKINRIDGE and MYRON.", "title": "Cobra Woman (1944)", "publishedDate": "2014-03-31T17:28:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "AMasHIXfhIY", "description": "Rapha\u00ebl De Cock unveils here a series of techniques typical of throat and overtone singing from Tuva, a region in Southern Siberia. You hear a suite of improvisations: a deep growling style of throat singing (Kargyraa), a technique that brings to mind the Jew's harp or the didgeridoo (Kh\u00f6\u00f6mei), a style that makes waves like water (Borbangnadyr) and one with overtones that whistle (Sygyt). \n\nRapha\u00ebl was 16 when he first heard Tuvan singers on the radio. As a Jew's harp- and Uilleann pipe- player, he noticed that their singing techniques worked according to the same drone principle as his instruments -- and so soon he started to look into making these sounds himself. After years of practice, with occasional refinements from Tuvans, visiting for concerts or encountered on his travels, he has perfected the art of overtone singing. The very same vocal techniques are used in Sardinian polyphonic choirs -- and these are another of Rapha\u00ebl's passions. He uses his throat singing (traditional and his own styles), innovations, improvisations and tones in various groups: Osuna, NadiSuna, GRIFF, Northern Lights, and the cine-concert project 'Odna'. He also gives singing lessons at Muziekpublique.\n\n---\nRapha\u00ebl De Cock d\u00e9voile une s\u00e9rie de techniques typiques de chants de gorge et chants diphoniques  de Touva, une r\u00e9gion dans le sud de la Sib\u00e9rie. Vous entendez une suite d'improvisations : un style profond de chant de gorge grognant (kargyraa), une technique qui rappelle le son des guimbardes ou didgeridoos (Kh\u00f6\u00f6mei),  un style qui ondule comme l'eau (borbangnadyr) et un avec des diphonies qui sifflent (sygyt). A l'\u00e2ge de 16 ans Rapha\u00ebl a pour la premi\u00e8re fois entendu les chanteurs tuvains \u00e0 la radio. Comme joueur de guimbarde et de cornemuse (uilleann pipes), leurs techniques de chant -- selon le m\u00eame principe de bourdon que ses instruments -- a fortement attir\u00e9 son attention et bient\u00f4t il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher \u00e0 les produire lui-m\u00eame. Apr\u00e8s de nombreuses ann\u00e9es de pratique et des ajustements occasionnels par des chanteurs tuvains en visite pour des concerts, ou pendant ses voyages, il s'est perfectionn\u00e9 dans les chants diphoniques. Les m\u00eames techniques vocales de gorge sont \u00e9galement utilis\u00e9es en polyphonie sarde, une autre passion de Rapha\u00ebl. Rapha\u00ebl utilise le chant de gorge,  traditionnel ou des techniques auto-invent\u00e9es, les improvisations et les timbres dans diff\u00e9rents groupes : Osuna, NadiSuna, GRIFF, Northern Lights, cineconcertproject \"Odna\",... Raphael donne \u00e9galement des cours de chants chez Muziekpublique.\n---\nRapha\u00ebl De Cock geeft een reeks van typische keel- en boventoonzangtechnieken ten prijs uit Tuva, een streek in Zuid-Siberi\u00eb. U hoort een improvisatie met achtereenvolgens een diepe brommende keelzangstijl (kargyraa), een techniek die doet denken aan de klank van mondharpen of didgeridoos (kh\u00f6\u00f6me\u00ef), en een stijl die kabbelt als water (borbangnadyr) en \u00e9\u00e9n met fluitende boventonen (sygyt). Rapha\u00ebl hoorde op 16-jarige leeftijd de eerste keer Tuvaanse keelzangers op de radio. Als mondharpspeler en beginnend doedelzakspeler (uilleann pipes) trokken deze zangtechnieken - met hetzelfde bourdonprincipe van deze instrumenten - sterk zijn aandacht en algauw begon hij er zelf naar te zoeken. Na vele jaren oefenen en occasionele bijsturing door Tuvaanse zangers, hier op bezoek voor concerten, of op zijn reizen, leerde hij en schaaft hij nog voortdurend zijn stem bij. \nDezelfde keelstemtechnieken worden immers ook gebruikt in Sardische polyfonie waar Rapha\u00ebl gepassioneerd mee bezig is. Rapha\u00ebl gebruikt keelzang, zowel traditionele als meer zelfuitgevonden technieken, improvisaties en timbres in verschillende groepen, o.a. OSUNA, NadiSuna, GRIFF, Northern Lights, cin\u00e9concertproject \"Odna\".

Quimby retired in 1955 and from 1956 to 1958, Hanna and Barbera produced the shorts until MGM closed the cartoon studio in 1957, and the last cartoon was released in 1958.[1] Most of these cartoons were produced in the standard Academy ratio (1.37:1). Four cartoons were produced for both Academy Ratio and CinemaScope formats (2.55:1, later 2.35:1). Finally, 19 cartoons were produced in widescreen CinemaScope format only.\n\nLike any other studio, MGM reissued and edited its cartoons when re-released to theaters. Many pre-1951 cartoons were reissued with Perspecta Sound, which was introduced in 1954. MGM also reissued its cartoons before the introduction of Perspecta Sound.

In his sense \" A scientist is he , who sees simple and thinks highly\".\n\n To incorporate this fact, among the children and common man Mihir panda introduced one innovative programme  \"simple innovation for my nation \" and popularly known as \"simple innovation \".In this arrangement problem of science and mathematics teaching can be intelligently tackled by making the low cost and no cost models and  common people get the idea to manufacture the innovative household materials. It does not require complicated instruments . His research work is  by collecting the unused articles around us and applying them as the no cost aid in the teaching learning process or for common man's requirements. The rubbish is  also be collected and used for manifesting the creativity and protecting the milieu. This phenomenon is implemented through an NGO namely SROSTI (Social development research organisation for science, technology and implementation) At/P.O.- Bahanaga in the District of Balasore, Odisha,India which is founded by Mihir during the year 1987. Though he had not got any financial aid or assistance from anybody but the organisation is decorated with thousand and thousands of scientific models, a garden of five acres, a laboratory measuring 150'-0\"x15'-0\" , sophisticated Audiovisual systems, workshop to materialise the thoughts of the children etc. He had a jeep which is used to transport his models to different rural  areas for displaying of  \"simple innovation \" programmefor which he do not accept any fees. Different kinds of new models are built in the workshop by the students under the strong supervision of the resource person of SROSTI. Of course, this laboratory is a living wonder in the realm of science. \nThat, Mihir panda had constantly been rendering service since 1987 to popularize science and mathematics among the millions of students ,teachers and common people through programme \"simple innovation\". He had manufacturing low cost models from the waste and unused materials  & instrumental in changing and enriching the lives of the rest in the society by inculcating a sense of positive attitude in their mind towards science.

Look at me, I was such a beautiful man. So beautiful, I was thought to be the son of Poseidon. My mother, who was taught by Athena in the ways of wits and wisdom, was thought to be the gods' equal. I seemed to have it all, but all I really wanted was the winged horse, Pegasus. \nThe wise seer of Ephyre, Polyidus, advised me to go sleep in Athena's temple. For the gods often spoke to men in their sleep. Sure enough, in my dream, Athena stood in front of me with a bridle of gold. \"Here is what will charm the steed you covet\" the wise goddess said.\n Excited by this newfound hope, I hurried out to the fields to find Pegasus. The horse looked at me so calmly, I was able bridle him without any trouble. The charm had worked! \nTogether, the we slayed terrible beasts such as the Chimaera, a monster that was a mix of lion, goat, and serpent, with ease.\u2028 With my great triumphs came a confidence that was too strong for any man. I began to think thoughts too great for any man. My great thoughts filled me with the deepest desire to fly up to the highest peaks of Olympus, where I believed I was worthy to take place with the gods. Pegasus, however, was wiser than I. He knew the flight was not one for a mortal to take, and threw me off his back. I did not die however, but was now hated by the gods and forced to roam the earth alone, avoiding the paths of man until I die. Pegasus, however, was welcomed into the beautiful stables of Olympus, serving as one of Zeus' most prized horses.\nTHE END", "title": "Bellerophon and Pegasus", "publishedDate": "2012-12-13T01:35:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "AMq-Kq0nbhI", "description": "\uc57c\uc0b0\uace0\ube44 (Onoclea sensibilis)-\uc6b0\ub4dc\ud480\uacfc\uc758 \uc591\uce58\uc2dd\ubb3c. \uc78e\uc774 \uae43\uaf34 \ubaa8\uc591\uc73c\ub85c \uac08\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c, \uc911\uad6d, \uc77c\ubcf8 \ub4f1\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ubd84\ud3ec\ud55c\ub2e4.\nJoins Blog : http://blog.joinsmsn.com/lavie11", "title": "\uc57c\uc0b0\uace0\ube44 (Onoclea sensibilis)", "publishedDate": "2013-05-18T00:24:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "AMqR5jQ-djg", "description": "Song of the Shofar- written arranged by David Flug for the Deemyon Orchestra.

(47.9 x 30.3 cm)\n1955.1494\nSterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, Massachusetts, U.S.A.\n\nA sturdy, elegantly dressed young woman sits on a parlor stool of fashionable Neoclassical design, incongruously peeling a lemon (so incongruous an action is it that many people, seeing the watercolor for the first time, assume that she is sewing, as Clark did when he bought it). She seems fully absorbed in her task, and that quiet concentration sets the tone for our response to the work: an appreciation of muteness and time suspended. Homer has given the figure an amplitude, fullness, and scale unprecedented in any of his earlier watercolors. Yet he has drained the scene of any narrative: the background\u2014which Homer forms from a light yellow wash and the mere suggestions of shadows\u2014offers no explanation of the woman's enigmatic action. The terse title he gave the sheet\u2014Lemon\u2014is similarly focused and neutral. The abstract qualities of color and form become, by default, the work's subjects. Lemon was one of five sheets that Homer showed in the American Water Color Society's 1877 exhibition. Of the four now known, all show women (or perhaps the same woman) at full length engaged in quiet activities: in addition to peeling a lemon, another reads, one stands in front of a blackboard, and a pair plays backgammon. The critics found in them all, whether they liked them or not, originality and individuality, and took pleasure in Homer's \"Americanness\"\u2014in spite of the fact that the theme of these pictures (genteel young women set against neutral backgrounds) was extremely fashionable in European and American circles.\n \n\u2014Marc Simpson, curator of Winslow Homer: Making Art, Making History", "title": "Winslow Homer, Lemon, 1876", "publishedDate": "2013-06-03T20:35:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "AN5B5xwEfV4", "description": "Growing up in a multicultural area like Miami can make it harder for younger children to have a connection with their Hispanic roots.

According to results from a  study,[50] higher levels of exposure to manganese in drinking water are associated with increased intellectual impairment and reduced intelligence quotients in school-age children. It is hypothesized that long-term exposure to the naturally occurring manganese in shower water puts up to 8.7 million Americans at risk.[47][51][52]\n\n Manganesepounds were used by Egyptian and Roman glassmakers, to either remove color from glass or add color to it.[12] The use as \"glassmakers soap\" continued through the Middle Ages until modern times and is evident in 14th-century glass from Venice.[13]\n\n Manganese is a silvery-gray metal that resembles iron. It is hard and very brittle, difficult to fuse, but easy to oxidize.[1] Manganese metal and itsmon ions are paramagnetic.[2]\n\n Among some 300 minerals containing manganese, only a dozen are of economic significance. Manganese ore primarily occurs as pyrolusite, braunite, psilomelane\u00a0 and to a lesser extent as rhodochrosite.\n\n Small amounts of manganese improve the workability of steel at high temperatures, because it forms a high melting sulfide and therefore prevents the formation of a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel bes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese can have a high tensile strength of up to 863\u00a0MPa.[29][30] Steel with 12% manganese was used for British steel helmets. This steelposition was discovered in  by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel.[31]\n\n The mostmon oxidation states of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6 and +7, though oxidation states from \u22123 to +7 are observed. Mn2+ oftenpetes with Mg2+ in biological systems. Manganesepounds where manganese is in oxidation state +7, which are restricted to the unstable oxide Mn2O7 andpounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion MnO4\u2212, are powerful oxidizing agents.[1] Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to disproportionation.", "title": "common manganese ore", "publishedDate": "2012-09-12T13:06:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANBsbhpRETE", "description": "Studs x2 Red Brick Location #1\nhttp://youtu.be/9RcrEz8De7s\nCollect Guide Studs Red Brick Location #2\nhttp://youtu.be/fezREp7QuCI\nPants Detector Red Brick Location #3\nhttp://youtu.be/tu1W5PmZ9Pk\nFast Repair Red Brick Location #4\nhttp://youtu.be/tu1W5PmZ9Pk\nStuds x10 Red Brick Location #5\nhttp://youtu.be/8WqjmUT8DzQ\nGold Instruction Page Detector Red Brick Location #6\nhttp://youtu.be/CGaEn7PhmK0\nFast Drill Red Brick Location #7\nhttp://youtu.be/kB26gEY2_-s\nFast Build Red Brick Location #8\nhttp://youtu.be/QVtGC6vO24c\nStuds x4 Red Brick Location #9\nhttp://youtu.be/MbG3N_ROhWE\nCollect Guide Studs Red Brick Location #10\nhttp://youtu.be/yU3wmH9DVCM\nFast Secret Knock Red Brick Location #11\nhttp://youtu.be/4Xlc2twdz3Q\nStuds x6 Red Brick Location #12\nhttp://youtu.be/UB89OxDLOrs\nFast Boomerangs Red Brick Location #13\nhttp://youtu.be/dLAiDkJ4zzY\nAttract Studs Red Brick Location #14\nhttp://youtu.be/ANBsbhpRETE\nRed Brick Detector Red Brick Location #15\nhttp://youtu.be/eZyP7PIPtjE\nInvincibility Red Brick Location #16\nhttp://youtu.be/8_DqMM1AT7k\nRegenerate Hearts Red Brick Location #17\nhttp://youtu.be/twfDKDaCzkA\nStuds x8 Red Brick Location #18\nhttp://youtu.be/0xuEhxsYM5U\nExtra Hearts Red Brick Location #19\nhttp://youtu.be/gtAeUrm4eYM\nFast Hack Red Brick Location #20\nhttp://youtu.be/tl0Sqm1YFSw\n\n-----------------------------------\nExcavator Golden Instruction Build #1\nhttp://youtu.be/SOPx25uICrQ\nSuper Cycle Golden Instruction Build #2\nhttp://youtu.be/QqvT6zDq47Y\nWyldstyle's Flying Dragster Golden Instruction Build #3\nhttp://youtu.be/PQL5F2uIe7U\nLocomotive Golden Instruction Build #4\nhttp://youtu.be/9WlAlvKCoxw\nBatwing Golden Instruction Build #5\nhttp://youtu.be/2zKX4p_9iSU\nBatmobile Golden Instruction Build #6\nhttp://youtu.be/VED5vv5H-Tg\nFlying Police Car Golden Instruction Build #7\nhttp://youtu.be/A73WJtPsUYc\nMega Kitty Golden Instruction Build #8\nhttp://youtu.be/uRzjaCONsdc\nOctan Swordfish Golden Instruction Build #9\nhttp://youtu.be/N9NPH3CqBOE\nMetalBeard Mec Golden Instruction Build #10\nhttp://youtu.be/fTlymGuD9kA\nMicro Manager Golden Instruction Build #11\nhttp://youtu.be/gewXiU2-aRE\nFlying Recycling Truck Golden Instruction Build #12\nhttp://youtu.be/NZwYYJ9ciI4\nEmmet's Mech Golden Instruction Build #13\nhttp://youtu.be/0vMr463ykjY\nFlying Ice Cream Golden Instruction Build #14\nhttp://youtu.be/kchAiuLbxCI\nLord Business Golden Instruction Build #15\n\n---------------------------\n100% Collectibles Guides\nAttack on Cloud Cuckoo Land\nhttp://youtu.be/Whah1VuJSSw \nBack From Reality\nhttp://youtu.be/6eIqGxxaE2A \nBricksburg Construction\nhttp://youtu.be/y3h7bK-Ermk \nBricksburg Under Attack\nhttp://youtu.be/kiKLTTkiuDs\nBroadcast News\nhttp://youtu.be/QqH5tUTDKVs\nCloud Cuckoo Land\nhttp://youtu.be/AiKE3HRRiUw\nEscape From Bricksburg\nhttp://youtu.be/r0mNlCSmn8s\nEscape From Cloud Cuckoo Land\nhttp://youtu.be/mru2D0qVrA0\nEscape From Flatbush\nhttp://youtu.be/FVpydMX8LLI \nFlatbush Gulch\nhttp://youtu.be/SPJcAO9yx3Q \nFlatbush Rooftops\nhttp://youtu.be/m48WvSz3HP0 \nInflitrate The Octan Tower\nhttp://youtu.be/WbVP5TSyNcc \nPut the Thing on the Thing  \nhttp://youtu.be/NosMgUR_jI0 \nThe Depths\nhttp://youtu.be/2SJzrUvbObY \nThe Final Showdown \nhttp://youtu.be/3eeBQVYQhiM \n\n------------------------\nALL RED BRICK Locations - Welcome To Bricksburg\nhttp://youtu.be/7KU2-z3uJ4Y\nStud Multiplier Locations\nhttp://youtu.be/tUKvZIbVqdM \n\n\nAchievement/Trophy\nWelcome To Bricksburg\nCollect all RED BRICKs", "title": "The Lego Movie Videogame - Attract Studs Red Brick Location #14", "publishedDate": "2014-02-28T16:41:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANBxvejaw9c", "description": "NOTE: Do not start from here!\n\nSTART QUIZ HERE: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ3IiHrMcZA", "title": "World Geography Quiz - Europe - Capitals 32/50", "publishedDate": "2012-12-15T17:48:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANCWcO0SPqw", "description": "http://scrolls.larpcraft.com/index.php?threads/peasants-larp-medieval-tunic-by-epic-armoury.6749/Simplistic tunic that works for just about anything.

Peter Iliff\nFilm Description: In his first feature following the success of television's Dawson's Creek, James Van Der Beek stars as Jonathan Moxon, the back-up quarterback on his high-school football team, the West Canaan Coyotes. In West Canaan, the only thing that matters is football, and the man who matters is the one with 22 divisional championships, coach Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight). Mox, as the young \"A\" student is called, is wrapping up his senior year on his way to Brown University in the shadow of his childhood friend, star quarterback Lance Harbor (Paul Walker). With only five games until the end of the season, Kilmer pushes his players too hard, and Lance suffers a career-ending injury, forcing Mox to play and win the game. Now the starter, Mox must deal with his newfound celebrity; the attentions of Lance's girlfriend, head-cheerleader Darcy (Ali Larter); prevent his friends and fellow players Billy Bob (Ron Lester) and Tweeder (Scott Caan) from self-destructing; prevent Coach Kilmer from crushing everybody; and hold on to his own girlfriend, Lance's sister Jules (Amy Smart). Oh, and Mox must also win the championship and prove himself the hero.\n\n\"varsity blues\",\"varsity blues clip\",\"varsity blues wale\",\"varsity blues part 1\",\"paul walker\",\"jon voight\",\"scott caan\",\"james van der beek\",\"thomas f duffy\",\"richard lineback\",\"mark walters\",\"brady coleman\",\"coffee mug videos\",\"football pads videos\",\"football videos\",\"whistle videos\",\"sports dramas\",drama,football,\"sports stories\",\"van toffler\",\"david gale\",\"michael tollin\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++174353,/m/02v72_,/m/046qq,/m/01kgxf,/m/03_dxb,/m/0gds7m,/m/0cct39c,/m/0bwskdx", "title": "Varsity Blues (1/9) Movie CLIP - Second String (1999) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-17T21:58:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANYVLl6EGvs", "description": "", "title": "Homograph: object", "publishedDate": "2014-02-11T09:43:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANYiSo4LNgU", "description": "Music video for cracker me please by Lashings of Jam", "title": "Lashings of Jam - Cracker Me Please [Official Music Video]", "publishedDate": "2010-05-27T00:40:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANYnj1h3_gQ", "description": "El Gorgojo de la picea uno de los animales mas feos y raros", "title": "El Gorgojo de la picea uno de los animales mas feos y raros", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T05:59:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANYu-lNhmlc", "description": "I had quite a few people ask me for a tutorial on how to stretch a 4:3 resolution to full screen or how to get black bars on the side of a widescreen monitor so that it maintains aspect ratio.

El cumplimiento de la Justicia es su propia abolici\u00f3n.\nLa historia no ha terminado, para hacerlo requerir\u00eda nuestra aprobaci\u00f3n.\nUn solo hombre libre es suficiente para probar que la libertad no ha muerto.\nLa cuesti\u00f3n jam\u00e1s es \u201cvivir con su tiempo\u201d, sino a favor o en contra de \u00e9l. Eso no depende.\nTodo lo que se jacta de ser un avance temporal admite con eso mismo que no est\u00e1 por encima del tiempo.\nLo nuevo no es m\u00e1s que la coartada de lo mediocre. Hasta ahora, el progreso no ha designado mas que un determinado incremento en lo insignificante. Lo esencial ha quedado en la infancia. Los hombres se han envuelto de costumbres, pero a\u00fan no las han pensado. \u00c9sta es una negligencia de la cual ya no tienen los medios. En este punto, la historia comienza.\nLas cat\u00e1strofes de la historia no demuestran nada en contra del bien. No son los movimientos revolucionarios los que han suspendido \u201cel curso normal de las cosas\u201d. Invirtamos. Es este curso ordinario el que es la suspensi\u00f3n del bien. En su encadenamiento, los movimientos revolucionarios componen la tradici\u00f3n del bien, o hasta ahora: la tradici\u00f3n de los vencidos. La nuestra.\nToda la historia pasada se resume a esto: la figura de una gran ciudad asediada por reyezuelos. Inexpugnable, el resto permanece.\nAbsolutamente antes del tiempo est\u00e1 el sentido.\nHay un reloj que no suena. Suya es la realeza.\n\nEs preciso actuar como si fu\u00e9ramos hijos de nadie. Su filiaci\u00f3n verdadera no est\u00e1 dada a los hombres. \u00c9sta es la constelaci\u00f3n de la historia de la que consigan reapropiarse. Es conveniente tener un pante\u00f3n. No todos los panteones se encuentran al final de una calle Soufflot.\nLos lugares comunes son la cosa m\u00e1s bella del mundo. Es necesario repetirse. La verdad siempre ha dicho la misma cosa, de mil maneras distintas. En ocasiones, los lugares comunes tienen el poder de hacer tambalear los mundos. El universo mismo naci\u00f3 de un lugar com\u00fan.\n\nEste mundo no est\u00e1 adecuadamente descrito porque no est\u00e1 adecuadamente discutido, y viceversa. Nosotros no buscamos un saber que d\u00e9 cuenta de un estado de hecho, sino un saber que los cree. La cr\u00edtica no debe temer ni a la pesadez de los fundamentos ni a la gracia de las consecuencias.\nEsta \u00e9poca es tan furiosamente metaf\u00edsica que trabaja sin cesar para olvidarlo.\nLa Metaf\u00edsica Cr\u00edtica: al repelerla, se la abraza.\"\n\nTodo el texto: http://tiqqunim.blogspot.com/2013/01/y-bien-la-guerra.html", "title": "Y bien, \u00a1la guerra! - TIQQUN (fragmento 1)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-09T07:24:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANivDWP2pQU", "description": "Find out how the technology inside of the Avegant Glyph works.", "title": "Avegant Glyph: How a Virtual Retinal Display Works", "publishedDate": "2014-01-04T21:45:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANj923SNuis", "description": "", "title": "Eva, la giraffa vanitosa.avi", "publishedDate": "2010-07-26T13:19:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANkOFIfkWY8", "description": "308nm(200-800nm available) UV automatic glass transmittance(transmission rate) tester in a clean room production line.\n\nPlease contact \nAstoria-Pacific Asia Co., Ltd.\nWayne Chiu +886-910-258-301\nE-mail add: cwchiu666@gmail.com\n\nFor detail, please visit http://www.astoria-pacific.com.tw/", "title": "308nm UV automatic glass transmittance(transmission rate) tester in a clean room production line", "publishedDate": "2014-06-13T02:48:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANkf-PKPs14", "description": "Larry Burton driving Burton & Greer team of Jack & Roy with winning pull in the BDHMC Mule pull in Bowling Green, KY on June 1, 2013", "title": "2013 BDHMC Mule Pull winning pull YT", "publishedDate": "2013-06-13T00:17:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANl59CIGyjM", "description": "This is a quick video just giving the details of the #Book Lover Meet-Up in Hyde Park, London on the 14th December 2013. \n\nBenjaminoftomes' video about it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8viJKusUxqY \n\nFacebook page: https://www.facebook.com/groups/507104506023795/?notif_t=group_r2j_approved\n\nLinks:\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/kool_kat_kitty\nyoutube: http://www.youtube.com/user/koolkatkitty1/videos\ngoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/kool_kat_kitty", "title": "#Book Lover Meet-Up", "publishedDate": "2013-11-03T19:12:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANlD-5N7tbo", "description": "Dok lama banget  :)   \nGambar diambil sesaat setelah Mandala Airlines Boeing 737-200  yang jatuh di kawasan Padang Bulan, Medan, Indonesia pada 5 September 2005 sekitar pkl 09.40 Wib", "title": "Pesawat Mandala Jatuh !!!", "publishedDate": "2014-09-05T03:57:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANlKLvcl1Gw", "description": "Video oficial de \"Ay, mujer\" de El Gucci, versi\u00f3n sinf\u00f3nica. \nUna producci\u00f3n de Claro M\u00fasica.

The tractor did OK, but it didn't have enough weight for traction to back in to the belt tight enough to keep it from slipping causing the blade to slow down. \n\nI'm surprised the camera picked up the sound of the blade as well as it did at that distance, but it gives you a good sense of what the sawyer hears at that end of the belt. Standing that close to the saw blade you hear that over most everything else making it hard to know if the engine is slowing down under load or if the belt is slipping.\n\nWith the Hart-Parr, I knew fairly quick it was the belt slipping as he was spinning the wheels trying to back in even half-way tight, but it still surprised me that it slipped so bad as to nearly stall the blade in such a small log.\n\nThe Allis Chalmers was another issue altogether. At first I couldn't tell if the tractor was pulling down under load or slipping the belt. After walking up and talking to the AC owner and finding that he was holding rpm on his end I applied a little belt dressing and tried again, and then again, hoping that if I could get through the knot I could roll the log and make it cut easier. BUT... then things came to a dead stop, belt and all, and I looked up at the tractor and saw the belt was half way off his pulley and smoking, looking as though it was slipping bad on his end. NOT..... It wasn't the belt slipping on the pulley, it was the PTO shaft spinning inside the pulley on the newly restored tractor. We got him shut down and I snapped the picture at the end of the video of the metal filings laying in the pulley. Not a pretty sight !  I wasn't able to catch up with again later to see what he found out on it, whether it sheared a key or if they forgot to install one when they put the pulley on during the restoration, but considering the saw blade was slowing down on the very 1st  cut, I'd have to say it was already loose before ever belting up to the mill.", "title": "Sawmill Problems with belt slippage and a spun pulley on 1800s Circular Sawmill", "publishedDate": "2014-09-29T22:59:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANpfQp0po2w", "description": "Romaji in Annotations.\n\nI own nothing in this video.

Ghost-hunters capture film of spooky orb moving around Victorian medical institute\n\n    Group was taking a guided tour of the Liverpool Medical Institute\n    The building, which opened in 1837, is renowned for spooky sightings \n    Team believe they communicated with Richard Caton, who died in 1926 \n\nSpooky footage claims to have captured the ghost of a long-dead Lord Mayor communicating with paranormal investigators.\n\nExperts caught the eerie interactions on camera during a guided tour of the Liverpool Medical Institute, which is renowned for its spooky sightings.\n\nThe team from Sefton Paranormal Investigators noticed several elements of spiritual activity as they watched the footage back after the spine-chilling investigation last month.\n\nThe Liverpool Medical Institute, which opened in 1837, is one of the oldest medical societies in the world. \n\nThere have been previous reports of ghostly sightings on the main staircase, the library and the Victorian lecture theatre \n\nAnd the team, made up of four investigators and 17 members of the public, believe they made contact with Richard Caton, the Lord Mayor of Liverpool from 1907-1908 - who died in 1926.\n\nTheir investigation began by identifying areas within the 19th century Grade II-listed building as potential hotspots for activity.\n\nPamela Robinette, from Sefton Paranormal Investigators, said: 'As a rule of thumb, we always begin by simply asking if there are any spirits that wish to communicate with us.\n\n'When we reached the medical library we set up electro-magnetic field sensors, known as rempods, on the outer side of the room.\n\nIf we did make contact, then the sensor should detect the electro-magnetic field that all spirits possess and set off an audible alarm with flashing lights - but it is very rare for this device to react.\n\n'The walls are covered with portraits of past significant bodies and we started by asking for the people in the portraits to step toward the device.\n\n'After calling for Richard Caton, Lord Mayor of Liverpool in 1908, the alarms went off.\n\n'We continued to direct questions to Richard Caton for two hours and have documented evidence of seventeen occurences in which the rempod was set off.\n\n'And spookily, each time this happened the temperature would drop by a staggering five degrees just before.'\n\nAnother part of the footage shows a ghostly orb at the foot of the main staircase, where others have previously claimed to have seen ghostly figures of a man and his dog.\n\nThe light anomaly seems to appear out of thin air before crossing the path of the group and disappearing again.\n\nA member of the team walks straight past the orb and appears not to notice it. \n\nMs Robinette explained that it was too bright and intense to be dust, and that if it had been an insect there would have been a specific flight path and shape.", "title": "Eerie footage claims to show ghost in Liverpool Medical Institute", "publishedDate": "2014-10-20T15:16:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANtYUBMOdWo", "description": "3.4.1 Concavity", "title": "3.4.1 Concavity", "publishedDate": "2014-11-11T22:01:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANtcOvlZOB0", "description": "This is an interview former president Rupiah Banda after he was blocked from traveling to South Africa by President Michael Sata and his cartel Mutembo Nchito, Fred M'membe and Wynter Kabimba", "title": "President Rupiah Banda Blocked by Sata and the Cartel", "publishedDate": "2013-06-09T19:18:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "ANtmpzpaeq8", "description": "Link to order this clip:\nhttp://www.criticalpast.com/video/65675066510_World-Fair_crowd-at-fair_James-Farley_crowd-at-Midway\nHistoric Stock Footage Archival and Vintage Video Clips in HD.\n\nUS Postmaster General, James Farley, formally opens the 1933 Century of Progress Worlds Fair in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe 1933 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois.

The flowers are produced in pendulous racemes 10 to 80 cm long, similar to those of the genus Laburnum, but are purple, violet, pink or white, but not yellow.\nFlowering is in the spring (just before or as the leaves open) in some Asian species, and in mid to late summer in the American species and W. japonica.\nThe flowers of some species are fragrant, most notably Chinese Wisteria. The seeds are produced in pods similar to those of Laburnum, and, like that genus, are poisonous.\n\nThere are two noted attributions for the name Wisteria. One, that the botanist Thomas Nuttall named the genus Wisteria in honour of Dr. Caspar Wistar (1761 - 1818) \u2014 some call it Wistaria but the misspelling is conserved under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.\n\nThe other, that the genus was named after Charles Jones Wister, Sr., of Grumblethorpe, the grandson of merchant and wine importer John Wister.\n\nDaniel Wister, Charles's father, joined with Samuel Miles and Robert Morris to underwrite the voyage of the American commercial vessel Empress of China.\n On board the ship was the vine that would later bear the Wister name.\n\n\nWisteria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail.

Believe me, the Leatherback Sea Turtle might look adorable and harmless, but lurking behind its cute face is a set of killer teeth, making its mouth one of the scariest in the world.. Hundreds of these jagged stalactite-like teeth called 'papillae' line the turtle's mouth and esophagus, all the way down to the gut. You just have to see it to believe it.\n\nThe Leatherback is the third largest living reptile in the world, and also the largest turtle. It's actually a pretty docile creature, with a diet mainly consisting of jellyfish. In fact, the only reason it gets so huge is because it eats an astonishingly large number of the slow-moving jellies. Sometimes, the leatherback can consume about 73 percent of its own body weight in a single day, which is about 16,000 calories and three to seven times more than it needs to survive. Talk about binge eating!\n\nSo why does this jelly-eating machine need a set of killer teeth, you ask? Well, the teeth gives it an evolutionary advantage. The sharp, pointy, backward-facing papillae actually prevent the slippery jelly from escaping by floating back out of the mouth. This means that the leatherback is able to eat all kinds of jellies -- right from the smallest swarms to the most massive ones like the Lion's Mane Jelly. This turtle species also has an unusually long esophagus that extends way past its stomach and all the way to the rear. Then it loops back up to connect to the stomach. So it's like a conveyor belt designed to catch, store and continuously process food.\n\nWhen a baby leatherback first makes an appearance in the world, it is just a tiny hatchling about 3-inches long. But thanks to all the water-rich jellies it consumes in its lifetime, it can grow to an average of four to six ft. long. Now, if you're thinking that the humungous turtle does nothing but eat and laze around all day, you're wrong. The leatherback turtle is a migratory species, travelling over 10,000 miles a year. It needs all the energy it can get to cover such large distances. And since jellyfish aren't exactly energy-boosting foods, the leatherback's best bet is to stuff its face with as many jellies as it can manage in one go.\n\nUnfortunately, despite its brilliantly designed digestive system, the leatherback is unable to differentiate between jellyfish and plastic trash floating in the water that gets stuck in its huge papillae.

Fluid flow in this ciliated structure is responsible for the induction of unilateral left-sided Nodal activity in the lateral plate mesoderm, which in turn regulates organ laterality. Bmp signalling activity has been implied in repressing Nodal expression on the right side, however its mechanism of action has been controversial. In a forward genetic screen for mutations that affect LR patterning, we identified the zebrafish linkspoot (lin) mutant, characterized by cardiac laterality and mild dorsoventral patterning defects. Mapping of the lin mutation revealed an inactivating missense mutation in the Bmp receptor 1aa (bmpr1aa) gene. Embryos with a mutation in lin/bmpr1aa and a novel mutation in its paralogue, bmpr1ab, displayed a variety of dorsoventral and LR patterning defects with increasing severity corresponding with a decrease in bmpr1a dosage. In Bmpr1a-deficient embryos we observed bilateral expression of the Nodal-related gene, spaw, coupled with reduced expression of the Nodal-antagonist lefty1 in the midline. Using genetic models to induce or repress Bmp activity in combination with Nodal inhibition or activation, we found that Bmp and Nodal regulate lefty1 expression in the midline independently of each other. Furthermore, we observed that the regulation of lefty1 by Bmp signalling is required for its observed downregulation of Nodal activity in the LPM providing a novel explanation for this phenomenon. From these results we propose a two-step model in which Bmp regulates LR patterning. Prior to the onset of nodal flow and Nodal activation, Bmp is required to induce lefty1 expression in the midline. When nodal flow has been established and Nodal activity is apparent, both Nodal and Bmp independently are required for lefty1 expression to assure unilateral Nodal activation and correct LR patterning.\n\nAuthor Summary \nAlthough vertebrates are bilaterally symmetric when observed from the outside, inside the body cavity the organs are positioned asymmetrically with respect to the left and right sides. Cases where all the organs are mirror imaged, known as situs inversus, are not associated with any medical defects. Severe medical problems occur however in infants with a partial organ reversal (situs ambigious or heterotaxia), which arises during embryonic development. Left-right asymmetry in the embryo is established by unilateral expression of Nodal, a member of the Tgf-\u00df superfamily of secreted growth factors, a role that has been conserved from human to snails. By performing a genetic screen in zebrafish for laterality mutants, we have identified the linkspoot mutant, which displayed partial defects in asymmetric left-right positioning of the internal organs. The gene disrupted in the linkspoot mutant encodes a receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmp), another member of the Tgf-\u00df superfamily of secreted growth factors. Further analysis of Bmp over-expression or knock-down models demonstrate that Bmp signalling is required for unilateral Nodal expression, through the initiation and maintenance of an embryonic midline barrier. Our results demonstrate a novel and important mechanism by which left-right asymmetry in the vertebrate embryo is established and regulated.\n\nSupplemental methods.\n- Video S1: High speed image of cilia rotation in the KV of a wild type embryo at 8 somites.

We also use rhythm to enhance understanding of body awareness and technique, and combine it with instruments and songs to help teach children about hops, jumps, and balance. Halfway into class we come together for music time where the children participate in a variety of fun creative music and movement activities. At the end of each class, your child will enjoy an exciting bubble dance party. Each class concludes back in Rompy's House, where we sing songs together and Rompy says a special goodbye to each child.

Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae are the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, families of the order include mammoths and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest surviving terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\n\nElephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance, predators such as lions, tigers, hyenas and wild dogs usually target only the young elephants (or \"calves\"). Females (\"cows\") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch, often the oldest cow. Elephants have a fission-fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Males (\"bulls\") leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans[by whom?]. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.\n\nAfrican elephants are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while the Asian elephant is classed as endangered. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past they were used in war; today, they are often put on display in zoos and circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature and popular culture.", "title": "Funny elephant attack Indian elephants rage rampage India attacking bike", "publishedDate": "2014-09-16T12:03:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "AOYpRgqHTrk", "description": "A short Interview on the properness of machines being used in trading by Wall Street firms.", "title": "CNBC William O'Brien Is Interviewed 9/15/10", "publishedDate": "2011-01-17T05:17:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "AOYuzWwg6Vo", "description": "China Ethylene glycol & Diethylene Industry @ http://bit.ly/10QRvKq, China Atrazine Industry @ http://bit.ly/13XDImf.\n\nThis report provide information on China's Ethylene glycol & Diethylene glycol industry and atrazine industry.", "title": "China Ethylene glycol & Diethylene glycol, Atrazine Market", "publishedDate": "2013-03-14T10:54:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "AOYwgO3ly-s", "description": "Finished piece: http://i.imgur.com/hdX3N.jpg\n\nGCode generated with the \"optimiserapids 0\" option.\nFeed rate: ~2000mm/min\nSpacing: 3mm\nDXF Halftone 2.1 available here:\nhttp://www.students.tut.fi/~syvajar3/", "title": "DXF Halftone 2.1, Line halftone", "publishedDate": "2012-10-21T08:28:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "AOZnwIeaxy4", "description": "", "title": "HCS 210   Pulverizer   Rice Grain", "publishedDate": "2014-06-16T00:05:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "AO_9-twPtHM", "description": "This is the 1979 hit song by Mel Tillis.

(February 2013)\nCarmex is a brand of lip balm meant to eliminate cold sores and soothe dry/chapped lips. It is sold in jars, sticks, and squeezable tubes.\nContents  [hide] \n1 History\n2 Ingredients\n3 References\n4 External links\nHistory[edit]\n\nAlfred Woelbing began experimenting with creating his own line of lip balm and other cosmetic products in the early 1930s. These were the beginnings of Carma Laboratories, Inc. After experimenting with his products, Woelbing created Carmex on his family's stove top. He began by selling the product from the trunk of his car. Popularity increased through word-of-mouth. During this time Woelbing and his wife poured their lip balm into the now well-known yellow-capped jars. Then in 1957, the family business moved out of the kitchen and into a rented facility in the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa.[1]\nAfter doing business like this, in 1972 Woelbing discontinued making sales calls, which had mostly been in Wisconsin, Illinois and parts of Indiana. Woelbing's son Don joined the business in 1973 and introduced assembly lines to Carma Labs. In 1975, due to the product's success, a new production facility was built in the southwest suburb of Franklin; production at the same facility continues to the present day[when?].\nCarma Labs began producing the product in squeezable tubes in 1988, then in 1999 the traditional stick form which had been the longtime domain of ChapStick and Blistex, Carma's major competitors in the lip balm market. Five years after these expansions within the company's production, in 1993 it was estimated that 9% of the lip balm market was held by Carma Labs. Alfred Woelbing continued to drive to the offices every day until 1997 when he suffered a stroke. He continued to come into the office at least once a week after this, until he died in 2001 at the age of 100.[citation needed]\nThe company continued further expansion under the management of his son Don and his grandsons Paul and Eric. In 2002, mint-flavored Carmex lip balm (SPF 30) joined original Carmex lip balm in the product line, and Carmex lip balm became available throughout North America, Australia, Europe, Asia and Africa. During 2006, several Internet voters picked strawberry and cherry as the newest Carmex lip balm sticks. According to mycarmex.com the company employs about 100 people and remains under the ownership of the founding family.[2][3]\nIngredients[edit]\n\nIn the United States, the active ingredients of Carmex lip balm are camphor (1.7%), menthol (0.7%), and phenol (0.4%). The inactive ingredients, in order of greatest used to least used in the product, are beeswax, cetyl esters, flavor, lanolin, parafin wax, petrolatum, salicylic acid, and cocoa seed butter.[4] However, this formula varies slightly around the world. For example, phenol is not included in Germany.[5] The use of phenol in cosmetics is prohibited in the European Union.\nSalicylic acid is often incorrectly thought to be a drying agent, and its inclusion regarded as unnecessary, and possibly intended to cause increased use of the product due to the drying effect; however, this is not true. Salicylic acid works as both a keratolytic and comedolytic agent by causing the cells of the epidermis to shed more readily, opening clogged pores and n", "title": "05 (AuD)", "publishedDate": "2013-10-30T14:19:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "AO_s_W6Ve34", "description": "Lea and her band sing \"A Whole New World\" from \"Aladdin\" at her cabaret show in NYC on March 27th.

No, this writhing mass of tentacles caught off the Singapore coast is just a bizarre relative of the starfish\nBasket star was caught and filmed off the coast of Singapore\nIt has five arms which branch off into smaller parts used to catch prey\nAnimal also uses them to move along and climb coral. It spreads the 'branchlets' out to create a large net or 'basket' to capture small crustaceans\nCreatures can live around 6,564 ft (2 km) underwater, feeding on plankton\nThey are related to brittle stars, sea urchins, starfish and sea cucumbers\n\nIt may look like an alien, or even a monstrous moving plant, but this incredibly complex-looking creature is a relative of the starfish.\n\nThe basket star (Gorgonocephalus caputmedusae) was caught off the coast of Singapore and continues to wave its arms after it is pulled out of water in this video.\n\nIt actually has five arms, which are each split into more dexterous 'branchlets', which it uses to catch prey underwater.\n\nThe creature can live around 6,564 ft (2 km) below the waves, but typically favours life between 50 ft (15 metres) and 500 feet (152 metres) below sea level, according to experts at Oregon State University.\n\nDespite being rarely seen, basket stars live along the Pacific Coast, from the Bering Sea to southern California.\n\n\nJr Saim, a business executive from Singapore, claims to have caught and filmed the animal, iO9 reported.\n\nBasket stars have five arms radiating from a central disk, like other members of the echinoderm family, which includes starfish, sea urchins and brittle stars.\n\nBut they differ from starfish, for example, because each arm branches out into countless flexible others, which can be used by the creature to create a tangled mesh designed to ensnare plankton and even small crustaceans.\n\nThese flexible tendrils act like a basket to catch prey, giving the animal its name.\nThey position themselves in a place where there is a current strong enough to cause small creatures to drift past it \u2013 without carrying the basket star away too.\nThe basket star spreads its arms out to create as large a \u2018basket\u2019 as possible. It then grabs prey by coiling its tendrils around plankton and small animals.\n\nVery little is known about the animal\u2019s eating habits, but it is known that the spines and hooks on its arms, as well as mucus, make it hard for prey to escape its clutches.\n\nExperts at the university explained: \u2018The basket star wraps several brachlets around its prey, forming a knot. This knotted arm is then drawn toward the central disk.\n\n\u2018The manner in which food is transferred through the disk to be digested is not yet known.\u2019\n\nBasket stars can have a central disk that is five-and-a-half inches (14cm) in diameter and each of their arms can be up to five times longer than their body.\nThey come in orange, red and white.", "title": "WATCH: Bizarre 'Alien' Sea Creature Caught by Fisherman in Singapore Coast | VIDEO", "publishedDate": "2014-10-14T22:13:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "AObb8MosaaQ", "description": "ZAM\u00d3W ALBUM: http://sklep.maxflo.pl/pl/p/Pokahontaz-Reversal/418\n\nMaxFloRec prezentuje ods\u0142uch albumu REVERSAL Pokahontaz.  \nNa p\u0142ycie znajduje si\u0119 13 zr\u00f3\u017cnicowanych muzycznie utwor\u00f3w, a to wszystko dzi\u0119ki wsp\u00f3\u0142pracy z kilkoma producentami.

This has its origins in the oak tree at Boscobel House, where the future King Charles II hid from his Parliamentarian pursuers in 1650 during the English Civil War; the tree has since been known as the Royal Oak. This event was celebrated nationally on 29 May as Oak Apple Day, which is continued to this day in some communities. 'The Royal Oak' is the third most popular pub name in Britain (541 in 2007) and has been the name of eight major Royal Navy warships. The naval associations are strengthened by the fact that oak was the main construction material for sailing warships. The Royal Navy was often described as 'The Wooden Walls of Old England ] (a paraphrase of the Delphic Oracle) and the Navy's official quick march is 'Heart of Oak'. Furthermore, the oak is the most common woodland tree in England. An oak tree has been depicted on the reverse of the pound coin (the 1987 issue) and a sprig of oak leaves and acorns is the emblem of the National Trust. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_oak\n\nCowdray is a Historic Tudor House set in Midhurst, West Sussex. Cowdray is one of England's most important early Tudor houses. This visitor attraction, visited by Queen Elizabeth I and King Henry VIII, was partially destroyed by fire in 1793. Its magnificent ruins are set in the stunning landscape of Cowdray Park, in the heart of the South Downs National Park. Cowdray plays host to special events throughout the season, including outdoor theatre and period re-enactments. The Cowdray audio tour is recommended for visitors and we also have a popular special children's version of the audio tour. http://www.cowdray.org.uk/\n\nCowdray Castle: http://www.violetdesigns.co.uk/cowdra...\n\nThe Walled Garden: http://www.walledgardencowdray.com/pa...\n\n\n\n\nThe original fortified manor house was built in 1284 by Sir John Bohun across the river from the town of Midhurst. He named it Coudreye, the Norman word for the nearby hazel woods. In 1592 the 1st Viscounts grandson Anthony-Maria Browne inherited Cowdray. During his ownership of Cowdray, Guy Fawkes was briefly employed as a footman and the 2nd Viscount was briefly imprisoned for complicity in the Gunpowder plot after staying away from Parliament on 5 November 1605 following a warning. During the English Civil War two thirds of the Cowdray estate were sequestered and the house was garrisoned by Parliamentary forces. There are marks on the walls of the main courtyard of the house thought to be from musketballs fired by soldiers during this time. On 24 September 1793, during restoration work, a fire started in the carpenters' work shop in the North Gallery where some smouldering charcoal was allowed to fall upon the sawdust and woodshavings strewn across the floor. During the restoration work the family's furniture and treasures had also been stored in the North Gallery to make re-decorating easier. From the collection only three paintings and a few small pieces of furniture were saved, the rest including artefacts from Battle Abbey being devoured by flames. During the early 19th century the house was left to ruin, it was quickly colonised by plants, most notably of ivy which hastened its decay. Small alterations were made to the surviving Kitchen Tower such as a floor being put in above the kitchens, however it was not inhabited. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowdray_...", "title": "Cowdray Oak - Quercus robur  - Eikartr\u00e9  - Ak\u00f6rn - Sk\u00f3gartr\u00e9", "publishedDate": "2013-10-19T14:48:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "AOfSwrO_lS0", "description": "http://3fm.nl/video - Speciaal voor de webcam deden Kris Berry & Perquisite nog een liedje!

I am really honoured to have this interview with Mr. President. \n Sir, first of all I would like to thank you for this rare and exclusive interview for us and also inviting us all the way from Thimphu to New Delhi. \n My first question is a very obvious one, Mr. President. What is the purpose of your visit to Bhutan? I mean you could have chosen any of the countries in the region. Does it indicate ever-growing relations between the two countries?\n Hon. President: Thank you for coming all the way from Thimphu to Delhi to interview me. \n Bhutan is special to India and our relationship has grown over the years. We share culture as well as history. Over the years, the Kings (Druk Gyalpos) and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru built the relationship and based it on a solid foundation. \n You have asked why I have chosen Bhutan as the destination for my foreign visit. Of course, I could have chosen any other country. But as I mentioned, we have a special relationship with Bhutan which cannot be compared with any other. This is reflected in the fact that the first foreign visit by Bhutanese Prime Minister Tobgay after his election was to Delhi. Similarly, the first foreign visit after assumption of office by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to Bhutan. \n As I mentioned, over the years we have built a strong relationship and it is unique. \n Interviewer: Mr. President, it is often described that Bhutan-India relationship is exemplary, and sometimes it is also felt it is rhetoric.\n Hon. President: No, I do not think it is rhetoric. Our relations are exemplary. The cooperation we have with Bhutan and the close relationship, our common security, the common approach of helping our people, the common objective to share experiences, resources and expertise with each other have placed our relations in a unique position. We are participating in the developmental projects of Bhutan without any conditionality.\n..............(a bit of address) Thanking Hon'ble RastrapathyJi -limited space not full speech loaded) thanking and Thankful to ALL -(Very WORST B'Band NET-Please change Music @ own Ur choice)", "title": "SlideshowHon'bleRastrapathyJi's-STATE VISIT TO BHUTAN-edweepNews(iNDiA)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-07T16:25:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "AOh9Jou4ULY", "description": "", "title": "\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f", "publishedDate": "2012-10-14T13:31:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "AOhPnOfYYvk", "description": "A quick profile of the newcoming Wii Fit Trainer!

A flat whisk, which can cover large shallow surfaces of roasting pans and skillets, is also ideal.\n\nStep 5: Use a vinaigrette whisk\nUse the small vinaigrette whisk for small jobs, such as dipping sauces, vinaigrettes, scrambled eggs, or even mixing drinks.\n\nStep 6: Choose a silicone whisk\nChoose a silicone-wrapped whisk if you have a lot of non-stick pans. A silicone whisk will prevent scratches. They're also easier to clean than stainless steel.\n\nStep 7: Use a dough whisk\nUse the aptly named dough whisk, which has a single coil in a flat spiral, for mixing batters and stiff dough.\n\nDid You Know?\nDid you know?

It usually appears in the first weeks of life and grows most rapidly over the first six months. Usually, growth is complete and involution has commenced by twelve months. Half of all infantile hemangiomas have completed involution by age five, 70% by age seven, and most of the remainder by age twelve.[1] In more severe cases hemangiomas may leave residual tissue damage. In infancy, it is the most common tumor.[2] The word \"hemangioma\" comes from the Greek haema- (\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03b1), \"blood\"; angeio (\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf), \"vessel\"; -oma (-\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1), \"tumor\".

While I am big, strong and tough, I personally believe my best assets are my versatility, tenaciousness and relentless determination. As you will see in my video, I have superb hands and am rarely brought down by the first tackler. I take as much pride in making a good block or tackle as I do in making an excellent catch. I am a team leader, always giving 110% and sacrificing for the benefit of the team. Lastly, the effort I put forth on the field is matched by the work I perform in the classroom.

It was a herbivore that walked both as a biped and a quadruped. Three species are recognized: P. walkeri (the type species), P. tubicen, and the short-crested P. cyrtocristatus. Remains are known from Alberta (Canada), and New Mexico and Utah (USA). It was first described in 1922 by William Parks from a skull and partial skeleton in Alberta.\n\nParasaurolophus is a hadrosaurid, part of a diverse family of Cretaceous dinosaurs known for their range of bizarre head adornments. This genus is known for its large, elaborate cranial crest, which at its largest forms a long curved tube projecting upwards and back from the skull. Charonosaurus from China, which may have been its closest relative, had a similar skull and potentially a similar crest. The crest has been much discussed by scientists; the consensus is that major functions included visual recognition of both species and sex, acoustic resonance, and thermoregulation.
